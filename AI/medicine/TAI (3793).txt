The genetic basis of cancer is increasingly understood, driving significant advances in personalized medicine.  Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting critical cellular processes like cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis.  Identifying these specific driver mutations, through techniques such as next-generation sequencing, is pivotal to tailoring treatment.  This understanding fuels the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for specific oncogenic mutations in lung cancer or the use of PARP inhibitors in cancers with BRCA mutations.  Furthermore, genomic profiling allows for the prediction of treatment response, minimizing adverse effects associated with ineffective chemotherapies and enabling the selection of patients most likely to benefit from immunotherapy, based on tumor mutational burden or expression of specific immune checkpoints.  Practical applications include improved diagnostic tools – liquid biopsies enabling early cancer detection and monitoring – and the development of novel therapeutic strategies aimed at correcting genetic defects, such as gene therapy for certain haematological malignancies.  While challenges remain, the integration of genomic data into clinical practice represents a paradigm shift, offering a move towards truly personalized cancer management.
