This presentation explores the multifaceted role of vaccination in preventing infectious diseases, highlighting crucial interdisciplinary links necessary for effective global health strategies.  While traditionally viewed through a medical lens, successful vaccination programs rely heavily on sociological, economic, and political factors.  We will examine the sociological influence of vaccine hesitancy and misinformation, emphasizing the need for effective communication strategies informed by behavioural science and public health expertise.  Economically, the presentation will analyze the cost-effectiveness of vaccination compared to the burden of disease, considering both direct healthcare costs and indirect losses due to morbidity and mortality.  Furthermore, the political landscape surrounding vaccine mandates and global vaccine equity will be discussed, acknowledging the ethical implications and the crucial role of international collaboration.  By examining these interdisciplinary connections, we aim to illustrate the complex interplay of factors that contribute to successful vaccination initiatives and propose a more holistic approach to future preventative healthcare strategies.  The presentation will conclude by outlining key areas for future interdisciplinary research to optimize vaccination impact.
