Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution, driven by technological advancements and a pursuit of less-traumatic patient outcomes.  Initially, MIS resembled a "keyhole" approach, utilizing rigid endoscopes offering limited visualization and dexterity. This was analogous to working on a complex clock mechanism through a narrow peephole – difficult and imprecise.

The subsequent development of flexible endoscopes broadened access and improved visualization, akin to replacing the peephole with a flexible endoscope, allowing for a more comprehensive, if still somewhat limited, view.  Further innovations, including the advent of robotic surgery, represent a significant leap.  Robotic platforms provide surgeons with enhanced dexterity, magnification, and three-dimensional visualization, transforming the operation from a restricted view to a highly controlled, three-dimensional workspace—analogous to upgrading from a basic magnifying glass to a high-powered microscope with articulated manipulators.

These technological advancements are accompanied by parallel developments in surgical instrumentation.  Smaller, more specialized instruments, initially stiff and inflexible, have transitioned to more adaptable designs, mimicking the evolution from rigid chopsticks to dexterous fingers.  Consequently, MIS now encompasses a diverse range of procedures,  achieving outcomes once thought unattainable through conventional open surgery, underscoring the continuous refinement and adaptation driving this surgical paradigm shift.
