Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This lecture explores the intricate relationship between a changing climate and human wellbeing, highlighting key mechanisms of impact.  Rising temperatures directly increase morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations, through heatstroke and exacerbation of cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to waterborne disease outbreaks and malnutrition due to agricultural disruption.  Furthermore, alterations in vector ecology lead to expanded ranges of disease-carrying insects, increasing the incidence of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.  Indirect impacts include mental health consequences stemming from displacement, trauma, and resource scarcity associated with extreme weather events.  Mitigation and adaptation strategies targeting greenhouse gas emissions and improved public health infrastructure are crucial for minimizing the adverse health consequences of climate change.  Future research must focus on quantifying these impacts and developing region-specific interventions to enhance climate resilience and protect vulnerable communities.
