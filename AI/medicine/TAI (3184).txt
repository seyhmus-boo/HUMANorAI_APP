Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, extending beyond the traditionally recognized impacts.  Recent research increasingly emphasizes the complex interplay between environmental shifts and human health outcomes.  Extreme weather events, exacerbated by climate change, directly cause injury and death, disrupt healthcare access, and exacerbate pre-existing conditions.  Furthermore, gradual changes like rising temperatures contribute to increased heatstroke incidence, respiratory illnesses due to worsened air quality, and the expansion of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.

Recent developments highlight the growing importance of understanding climate change's indirect effects. Food insecurity, resulting from altered agricultural patterns, contributes to malnutrition and associated health problems.  Displacement due to sea-level rise and extreme weather creates vulnerable populations at risk for infectious diseases and mental health issues.  Moreover, the social determinants of health are disproportionately impacted, with marginalized communities bearing the brunt of climate-related health risks.  This necessitates a shift towards climate-resilient healthcare systems and equitable adaptation strategies. Ongoing research focuses on quantifying these impacts, developing predictive models, and implementing effective interventions to mitigate the escalating health burden of a changing climate.
