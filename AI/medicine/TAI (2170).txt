The evolution of minimally invasive surgery (MIS) represents a paradigm shift driven by interdisciplinary collaboration.  Early laparoscopic techniques, pioneered in the late 20th century, relied heavily on advancements in optics and instrumentation from engineering.  The initial limitations of dexterity and visualization spurred further innovation.  Biomedical engineering contributed significantly through the development of robotic surgical systems, offering enhanced precision and control, overcoming the limitations of human hand tremor and limited range of motion.

Simultaneously, advancements in imaging, specifically medical imaging (radiology, ultrasound), provided real-time guidance and improved surgical planning, a crucial aspect of complex MIS procedures.  This integration with computer science led to the rise of image-guided surgery and simulation training.  Furthermore, the development of novel biocompatible materials for sutures, implants, and instruments has been crucial for reducing trauma and enhancing patient outcomes. This convergence of expertise across engineering, computer science, materials science, and medicine has propelled MIS from a niche technique to a cornerstone of modern surgical practice.
