Cancer's genetic basis has been a central focus of biomedical research since the discovery of oncogenes in the 1970s.  Early studies established that somatic mutations in proto-oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes drive uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.  However, the complexity of cancer, with its heterogeneous mutational landscapes and microenvironmental influences, initially hindered the translation of this knowledge into effective therapies. Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, particularly next-generation sequencing (NGS), have revolutionized our understanding of cancer genetics, revealing the intricate interplay of driver and passenger mutations within individual tumors.  This has propelled the development of personalized medicine approaches.  Targeted therapies, designed to specifically inhibit oncogenic driver mutations, offer improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies.  Furthermore, genomic profiling is increasingly used to predict treatment response, enabling the selection of optimal therapies based on individual tumor characteristics. While challenges remain, including the identification of actionable targets and the management of acquired resistance, the integration of genomic data into clinical practice continues to improve cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, paving the way for truly personalized cancer care.
