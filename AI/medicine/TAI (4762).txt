Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, often conflated with typical developmental challenges.  However, recent decades have witnessed a surge in research highlighting the prevalence and impact of disorders like anxiety, depression, and substance use in this population.  Trends show increasing rates, potentially influenced by societal factors such as increased academic pressure, social media usage, and climate anxiety.  These factors interact with biological vulnerabilities to manifest as diagnosable disorders.

Treatment approaches have evolved significantly.  Early interventions focused heavily on psychodynamic therapies, gradually incorporating cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and family-based therapies.  Pharmacological interventions, while controversial, play a role in managing severe symptoms, particularly in cases of depression and psychosis.  The emphasis today is on integrated care, incorporating individual therapy, family support, peer support groups, and potentially medication, tailored to the individual's needs and context.  Early identification and intervention remain crucial to optimize outcomes and prevent long-term consequences.  Further research is needed to understand the interplay of risk factors and to refine evidence-based treatment strategies for this vulnerable population.
