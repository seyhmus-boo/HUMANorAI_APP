Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, often dismissed as transient "teenage angst."  However, contemporary research reveals a concerning rise in prevalence rates for disorders like depression, anxiety, and substance abuse among this vulnerable population.  Factors contributing to these trends include increased academic pressure, social media's impact on self-esteem, and broader societal changes.  

Treatment approaches have evolved significantly.  Previously, institutionalization was common, whereas today, a biopsychosocial approach dominates. This integrates psychological therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), alongside pharmacological interventions where appropriate, and consideration of the adolescent's social and familial context.  Early intervention is crucial, emphasizing preventative measures like promoting positive mental health in schools and communities, alongside readily accessible and age-appropriate mental health services.  Ongoing research focuses on refining existing treatments and developing novel approaches to address this escalating public health challenge.
