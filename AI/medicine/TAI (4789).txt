Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of microorganisms to withstand antimicrobial drugs, poses a significant and escalating global threat.  This presentation will examine the multifaceted nature of AR, highlighting its emergence as a consequence of both the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, as well as agricultural practices. The selective pressure exerted by widespread antibiotic exposure drives the evolution and dissemination of resistance mechanisms, including enzymatic inactivation, target modification, and efflux pump overexpression.  The global implications are profound, jeopardizing the effectiveness of treatments for bacterial infections, potentially leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  This lecture will explore the complex interplay of factors contributing to the AR crisis, including the lack of new antibiotic development, inadequate infection control practices, and the global movement of resistant pathogens.  Finally, strategies for mitigating the crisis, encompassing responsible antibiotic stewardship, enhanced surveillance, and the development of novel antimicrobial therapies, will be discussed.  Addressing AR demands a coordinated global response to ensure the continued availability of effective treatments.
