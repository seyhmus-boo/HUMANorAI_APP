This presentation explores the emerging field of quantum-inspired approaches to understanding and treating mental health disorders in adolescents.  While traditional models rely on classical neurological and psychological frameworks, we propose considering the potential of quantum mechanics to offer novel insights. The increasing prevalence of conditions such as anxiety and depression in adolescents suggests a need for paradigm shifts in our understanding of their etiology.  We will examine the potential for quantum entanglement to model complex interconnectivity within neural networks and the impact of environmental stressors on this delicate balance.  Further, we will discuss the possibility of quantum coherence playing a role in cognitive processes, suggesting potential targets for novel therapeutic interventions. Although direct applications remain nascent, we will explore the implications of quantum computing for analyzing large datasets of adolescent mental health, enabling the development of more personalized and effective treatments.  Finally, we will review preliminary research using quantum-inspired algorithms to analyze brain imaging data and predict treatment response, highlighting the potential for translating theoretical quantum concepts into tangible clinical advancements for improved adolescent mental health care.
