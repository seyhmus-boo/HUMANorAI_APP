Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding ongoing critical analysis. This presentation explores key ethical dilemmas inherent in the process, focusing on three core areas: equitable allocation of scarce resources, the definition and assessment of death, and the potential for coercion and exploitation within the donor-recipient relationship.  We will examine existing allocation systems, highlighting inherent biases and inequalities in access to life-saving transplants, considering factors such as socioeconomic status and geographic location.  The debate surrounding the definition of death, particularly brain death, will be critically analyzed, acknowledging both its practical and philosophical complexities. Finally, the presentation will address vulnerabilities within the donor consent process, exploring measures to safeguard against exploitation and ensure truly informed consent, particularly in vulnerable populations.  The aim is to stimulate discussion and promote best practices that uphold ethical principles of justice, fairness, and respect for persons within the organ transplantation system.
