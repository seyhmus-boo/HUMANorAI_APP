Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges inherent in translating our burgeoning understanding of cancer's genetic basis into effective personalized medicine.  While genomic sequencing reveals the unique mutational landscape of individual tumours, translating this information into targeted therapies presents significant hurdles.

Firstly, the sheer complexity of cancer genomes – with numerous driver and passenger mutations – necessitates sophisticated bioinformatic analyses to identify truly actionable targets.  Differentiating between causally significant mutations and incidental findings remains a major challenge, potentially leading to ineffective or even harmful treatments.  Secondly, tumour heterogeneity, both intratumoural and intertumoural, poses a significant obstacle.  A treatment effective against one clone may fail to address others, leading to relapse.  Finally, preclinical modelling presents difficulties.  Creating accurate in vitro and in vivo models that faithfully recapitulate the complex genetic and microenvironmental interactions within a patient’s tumour is crucial yet often proving elusive.  Overcoming these challenges is essential for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer medicine.
