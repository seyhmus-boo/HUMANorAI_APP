Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased morbidity and mortality through heat-related illnesses, exacerbating existing cardiovascular and respiratory conditions.  Changes in precipitation patterns, including increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as floods and droughts, displace populations, disrupt sanitation systems, and increase the risk of waterborne and vector-borne diseases.  Furthermore, alterations in agricultural yields and food security threaten nutritional deficiencies and malnutrition, particularly in vulnerable populations.  The expansion of suitable habitats for disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, leads to a wider geographic distribution of infectious diseases like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus.  Indirect impacts include mental health consequences stemming from climate-related trauma, displacement, and economic insecurity.  Effective mitigation and adaptation strategies are crucial to minimize these health impacts, necessitating integrated approaches that address climate change at its source while simultaneously building resilient healthcare systems capable of responding to evolving climate-related health challenges.  Further research is needed to quantify the precise burden of disease attributable to climate change and to develop targeted interventions tailored to specific geographic contexts and vulnerable populations.
