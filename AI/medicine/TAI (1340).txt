The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical global challenge.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.  Recent studies highlight a surge in heatstroke hospitalizations and deaths during extreme heat events, exceeding projections based on historical data.  Beyond direct thermal effects, climate change exacerbates existing health threats.  Changes in precipitation patterns intensify the risk of waterborne diseases, while altered vector distributions expand the geographical reach of infectious diseases like malaria and dengue fever.  Furthermore, the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events – hurricanes, floods, and wildfires – lead to both immediate injuries and fatalities, as well as long-term mental health consequences, displacement, and disruptions to healthcare access.  Recent research emphasizes the synergistic impacts of these factors, highlighting the compounding vulnerabilities within already disadvantaged communities.  Addressing this multifaceted problem necessitates integrating climate resilience into public health strategies, encompassing early warning systems, improved infrastructure, and targeted interventions focused on vulnerable populations to mitigate the escalating health burdens associated with a changing climate.
