Mental health disorders in adolescents have garnered increasing attention in recent decades, though their prevalence has historically been underrecognized and undertreated.  Historically, adolescent emotional distress was often attributed to hormonal fluctuations or "teenage angst," lacking the nuanced understanding afforded by modern diagnostic frameworks.  However, epidemiological studies now reveal a significant rise in the incidence of conditions like anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use disorders among this population.  These trends are complex and multifaceted, influenced by societal factors such as increased academic pressure, social media usage, and exposure to trauma.  Treatment approaches have evolved significantly, moving beyond solely pharmacological interventions.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) have proven highly effective in managing symptoms of various disorders, emphasizing the development of coping mechanisms and adaptive behavioral patterns.  Family-based interventions are also crucial, recognizing the significant role of family dynamics in both contributing to and mitigating adolescent mental health challenges.  Further research is needed to fully understand the interplay of risk factors and to develop more effective, culturally sensitive, and accessible treatment strategies for this vulnerable population.
