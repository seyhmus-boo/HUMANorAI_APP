The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical area of study.  Historically, the impact of environmental factors on health has been understood since antiquity, with Hippocrates noting the influence of geography on disease.  However, the scale and scope of climate change's impact represent a novel challenge.  Early research focused on direct impacts like heat-related mortality and the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, demonstrating a clear correlation between rising temperatures and increased morbidity and mortality.  More recently, research has broadened to encompass indirect effects, including air pollution exacerbating respiratory illnesses, the disruption of food security leading to malnutrition, and the mental health consequences of displacement and extreme weather events.  Studies consistently highlight disproportionate impacts on vulnerable populations, exacerbating existing health inequalities.  While significant advancements have been made in understanding these linkages, substantial research gaps remain, particularly in modelling complex interactions and predicting future scenarios accurately.  Further investigation into climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies is crucial to safeguarding public health in the face of this global challenge.
