Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health security threat, demanding an interdisciplinary response.  Its emergence stems from the interplay of evolutionary biology (bacterial adaptation), human behaviour (overuse and misuse of antibiotics), and socio-economic factors (access to healthcare, sanitation).  The agricultural sector contributes significantly, with widespread antibiotic use in livestock accelerating resistance gene development and dissemination.  These genes readily transfer between bacterial species, even across diverse environments, highlighting the crucial role of environmental microbiology and ecosystem dynamics in AR's trajectory.

Addressing AR necessitates a multi-pronged approach.  Public health initiatives, including antibiotic stewardship programs and improved infection control practices, are crucial, but require behavioural economics and social science interventions to enhance compliance.  Further, advancements in drug discovery and development, requiring expertise in chemistry, pharmacology, and biotechnology, are critical for generating novel antibiotics and alternative therapeutic strategies.  Finally, effective surveillance and monitoring systems, informed by data science and epidemiology, are essential for tracking resistance patterns and informing policy responses.  A collaborative, interdisciplinary framework, encompassing natural and social sciences, is therefore paramount to mitigating the catastrophic global implications of AR.
