Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting notable trends in prevalence and presentation.  This abstract reviews current literature on the epidemiology and treatment of these disorders.  Studies consistently report rising rates of anxiety and depression, particularly among girls, alongside increasing concerns regarding self-harm and suicidal ideation.  Contributing factors include societal pressures, technological advancements, and potential genetic vulnerabilities.  Effective interventions often involve a multi-modal approach, integrating evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).  Pharmacological interventions, while sometimes necessary, are generally considered adjunctive to psychotherapy, particularly for severe cases.  Access to timely and appropriate care remains a major challenge, exacerbated by disparities in access to mental health services and a shortage of trained professionals.  Future research should focus on early intervention strategies, culturally sensitive approaches, and the development of innovative, accessible treatments tailored to the specific needs of this vulnerable population.  Addressing the multifaceted determinants of adolescent mental health is crucial for improving outcomes and reducing the long-term consequences of untreated disorders.
