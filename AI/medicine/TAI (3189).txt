Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by small incisions and reduced trauma, has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception.  Early attempts, such as laparoscopy in the early 20th century, were largely limited by rudimentary instrumentation and inadequate visualization.  These limitations restricted procedures to diagnostic applications and simple interventions.  The development of fiber optics in the mid-20th century significantly advanced MIS, enabling improved illumination and visualization within the body cavity.  This paved the way for more complex procedures, though dexterity remained a challenge.

The subsequent introduction of advanced imaging techniques, such as ultrasound and computerized tomography, further enhanced surgical planning and intraoperative guidance.  Concurrently, robotic surgery emerged, offering surgeons enhanced precision, dexterity, and ergonomic improvements compared to conventional laparoscopy.  The development of smaller instruments, improved suture techniques, and energy-based devices like lasers and electrocautery have further refined MIS, leading to reduced surgical time, improved patient outcomes, and faster recovery periods.  Ongoing research focuses on augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and single-port access to further refine minimally invasive techniques and extend their application to a wider range of surgical specialties.
