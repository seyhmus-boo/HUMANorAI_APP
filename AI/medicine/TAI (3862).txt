Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant global public health concern, exhibiting evolving trends across historical periods.  Historically, understanding and treatment were limited, often characterized by stigmatization and institutionalization.  Early 20th-century approaches lacked evidence-based methodologies, relying heavily on psychoanalysis and institutional care with often detrimental outcomes.  The latter half of the century saw the rise of psychopharmacology and cognitive-behavioral therapies (CBT), offering more targeted interventions.  Recent decades have witnessed a marked increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression among adolescents, potentially influenced by factors such as societal pressures, technological advancements, and climate change.  This rise necessitates a multi-faceted approach to treatment, integrating pharmacological interventions where appropriate with psychotherapeutic techniques such as CBT, dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and family-based therapy.  Further research is crucial to understand the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors driving these trends, ultimately improving early detection, prevention strategies, and the efficacy of existing treatments to mitigate the significant morbidity and mortality associated with adolescent mental health disorders.
