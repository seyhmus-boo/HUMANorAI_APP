Cancer is a heterogeneous disease driven by somatic mutations accumulating within cells.  Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, enabling comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes and transcriptomes.  This has led to the identification of numerous driver mutations, specific gene fusions, and copy number alterations, providing insights into the diverse molecular mechanisms underlying oncogenesis. This genomic information is increasingly informing the development of personalized medicine approaches. Targeted therapies, designed to selectively inhibit the products of oncogenic mutations, have shown remarkable success in certain cancers, improving treatment efficacy and reducing toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapies.  Furthermore, immunotherapy, harnessing the patient's immune system to target tumor-specific antigens, is significantly impacted by genomic profiling, aiding in the prediction of response and the identification of suitable candidates.  While challenges remain, including the identification of actionable mutations in many cancers and the development of effective strategies for overcoming drug resistance, the integration of genomic data into clinical decision-making continues to transform cancer care, paving the way for truly personalized and precision oncology approaches. Future research should focus on integrating multi-omics data, understanding tumor microenvironment heterogeneity, and developing predictive biomarkers to optimize treatment selection and improve patient outcomes.
