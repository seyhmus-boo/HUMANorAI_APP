Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  Consider the allocation of organs as a limited resource – akin to distributing lifeboats after a shipwreck.  Simple fairness dictates a just distribution, yet defining "fairness" in this context is complex.  Should we prioritize those most likely to benefit, mirroring the selection of the strongest survivors for lifeboats?  Or should we favour those who have contributed most to society, creating a meritocratic system analogous to a lottery weighted by societal impact?

Furthermore, the issue of informed consent is paramount.  The process of donation, whether from a living or deceased donor, requires rigorous ethical scrutiny.  Imagine a scenario where a family member pressures a grieving relative into organ donation – this breaches the autonomy principle, akin to forcing someone onto a lifeboat against their will.  Finally, the potential for coercion, particularly in developing nations where financial incentives may be involved, highlights the ethical need for transparency and safeguarding vulnerable populations, preventing organ harvesting from becoming akin to a modern-day slave trade.
