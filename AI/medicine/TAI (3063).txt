Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with issues frequently dismissed as "teenage angst." However, recent decades have witnessed a marked increase in reported cases of disorders such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse in this demographic.  This rise is likely multifactorial, encompassing societal pressures, increased access to diagnosis, and evolving understanding of mental illness.  

Trends reveal a concerning disparity in access to adequate care, particularly for marginalized groups.  Effective treatment strategies vary depending on the specific disorder and individual needs.  Evidence-based approaches include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and medication, often implemented in conjunction.  Early intervention is crucial, as untreated mental health issues in adolescence can have significant long-term consequences impacting academic achievement, social functioning, and overall well-being. Future research should focus on preventative measures and improving accessibility to culturally sensitive and comprehensive mental healthcare for all adolescents.
