Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical skills.  Early laparoscopic procedures were largely limited by two-dimensional visualization and bulky instrumentation, resulting in restricted dexterity and longer operative times.  This review summarizes key advancements, including the transition from conventional laparoscopy to robotic-assisted surgery (RAS), offering enhanced precision, dexterity, and three-dimensional visualization.  The incorporation of advanced energy sources, such as ultrasonic shears and bipolar coagulation, has improved hemostasis and tissue dissection, reducing blood loss and operative trauma.  Concurrent development of smaller, more ergonomic instruments has further enhanced precision and minimized invasiveness.  Furthermore, the integration of augmented reality and artificial intelligence into MIS platforms holds significant promise for the future, potentially enabling real-time anatomical mapping, improved surgical planning, and enhanced trainee education. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the learning curve associated with new technologies and the need for wider accessibility. Future research should focus on addressing these limitations to further improve the safety, efficacy, and affordability of MIS techniques, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.
