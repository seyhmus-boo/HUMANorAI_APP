Adolescent mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, are exhibiting concerning upward trends globally, influenced by complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors.  Neurodevelopmental vulnerabilities interact with stressful life events, peer pressure, and societal pressures (e.g., academic competition, social media influence) to increase risk.  Effective treatment necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, integrating expertise from psychiatry, psychology, and social work.  Psychiatrists provide pharmacological interventions where clinically indicated, while psychologists employ evidence-based therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to address maladaptive thought patterns and behaviours.  Social workers contribute by addressing systemic issues, such as family dynamics and access to resources, fostering a supportive environment crucial for sustained recovery.  Furthermore, school-based interventions and community programs play a vital role in early identification, prevention, and promoting mental wellbeing, highlighting the need for seamless collaboration between healthcare professionals, educators, and community organizations. This holistic approach maximises treatment efficacy and fosters resilience in vulnerable adolescents.
