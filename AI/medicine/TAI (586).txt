While seemingly disparate, quantum mechanics subtly influences the evolution of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques.  The miniaturization driving MIS, exemplified by the development of smaller instruments and cameras, relies on advancements in materials science deeply intertwined with quantum phenomena.  The improved precision of robotic surgery, for example, necessitates precise control of actuators at the nanoscale, a realm governed by quantum effects influencing material properties like strength and conductivity.  Furthermore, the development of advanced imaging modalities crucial for MIS, such as near-infrared fluorescence imaging and photoacoustic tomography, depends on the quantum interactions of light and matter.  The high spatial resolution achieved in these techniques hinges on manipulating photons at the quantum level, allowing surgeons to visualize minute anatomical structures with unprecedented clarity.  Even the design of specialized surgical lasers, leveraging stimulated emission of radiation (a quantum phenomenon), is critical for precise tissue ablation and coagulation during MIS.  Consequently, while not directly employing quantum computation within the operating room, the underlying technological progress in MIS is inextricably linked to the quantum world, driving continual refinement and pushing the boundaries of what's surgically achievable.  Future developments may even see direct applications of quantum technologies, such as improved sensing and control systems, leading to further paradigm shifts in minimally invasive surgery.
