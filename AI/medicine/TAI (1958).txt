Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents significant ethical dilemmas.  Central concerns revolve around equitable access, often exacerbated by disparities in socioeconomic status and geographical location.  The allocation of scarce organs necessitates transparent and justifiable criteria, balancing medical urgency with factors like life expectancy and quality of life, a process fraught with potential biases.  Recent developments in organ preservation techniques and xenotransplantation, while offering hope for increased supply, raise further ethical complexities.  Xenotransplantation, using animal organs, necessitates careful consideration of animal welfare and the risk of zoonotic disease transmission.  Furthermore, the increasing use of artificial intelligence in organ allocation algorithms requires scrutiny to ensure fairness and prevent algorithmic bias perpetuating existing inequalities.  Debate continues surrounding the ethical implications of mandated organ donation, informed consent procedures, and the evolving definition of death itself, reflecting the multifaceted nature of ethical considerations in this rapidly advancing field.
