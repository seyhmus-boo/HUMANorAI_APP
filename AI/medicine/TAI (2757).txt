Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's capacity to treat bacterial infections.  This presentation will examine the multifaceted drivers of AR, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal health, inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, and the inherent evolutionary capacity of bacteria.  The consequences are dire, ranging from increased morbidity and mortality to extended hospital stays and heightened healthcare costs.  The global implications extend beyond individual health, impacting economic productivity, food security (via livestock production), and global health security, potentially reversing decades of progress in infectious disease control.

Practical applications to mitigate the spread of AR will be discussed, focusing on strategies that can be implemented at individual, community, and national levels. These include promoting responsible antibiotic stewardship through improved prescription practices and public health campaigns emphasizing antibiotic awareness.  The role of advanced diagnostic tools for rapid bacterial identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing will be highlighted, alongside the importance of investing in research and development of novel antimicrobials and alternative therapeutic approaches, such as phage therapy and immunotherapies.  Finally, the presentation will emphasize the urgent need for international collaboration and policy coordination to effectively address this critical global challenge.
