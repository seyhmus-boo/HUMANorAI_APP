Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIST) have revolutionized surgery, significantly improving patient outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of MIST, highlighting key advancements and their practical applications.  Early laparoscopic procedures, initially limited by instrumentation and visualization challenges, laid the foundation for contemporary techniques.  The development of advanced imaging modalities, such as high-definition cameras and robotic systems, has dramatically enhanced precision and dexterity.  Robotic surgery, in particular, allows for smaller incisions, increased range of motion, and tremor filtration, leading to reduced trauma and improved cosmetic results.  Furthermore, the integration of 3D visualization and augmented reality technologies is further refining surgical precision and facilitating complex procedures with enhanced intraoperative navigation.  These technological advancements have broadened the applicability of MIST across a range of surgical specialties, including colorectal, urological, gynecological, and cardiac surgery.  This presentation will explore the impact of these evolving techniques on surgical training, patient recovery times, and healthcare costs, examining both the benefits and limitations of contemporary MIST approaches.  Finally, we will briefly discuss emerging trends in natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and their potential future implications.
