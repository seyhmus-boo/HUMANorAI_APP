Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health globally. This presentation explores the intricate relationship between a changing climate and its impacts on human wellbeing, encompassing both direct and indirect effects.  Direct impacts include increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the expansion of vector-borne disease transmission zones, and the exacerbation of air pollution-related respiratory illnesses.  Indirect effects are equally crucial, encompassing disruptions to food security, water scarcity leading to malnutrition and infectious disease outbreaks, and mental health consequences stemming from displacement and climate-related trauma.

This presentation will detail the evidence base supporting these connections, focusing on specific examples from vulnerable populations and geographical regions.  Furthermore, it will discuss practical applications for public health professionals, including the development of early warning systems for heatwaves and infectious disease outbreaks, improved infrastructure resilience to extreme weather events, and the integration of climate change considerations into health planning and policy.  By highlighting the urgent need for proactive and integrated strategies, this presentation aims to foster a more robust and climate-resilient public health system capable of mitigating the anticipated health impacts of climate change.
