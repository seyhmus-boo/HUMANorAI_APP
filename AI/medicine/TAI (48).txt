Cancer, a complex group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, arises from a multitude of genetic and epigenetic alterations.  While traditional cancer therapies have shown efficacy, their effectiveness is often limited by inter-patient heterogeneity and significant adverse effects.  Advances in genomics and bioinformatics have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, enabling the development of personalized medicine approaches.  This review examines recent progress in elucidating the intricate interplay between specific genetic mutations, tumor microenvironment, and cancer progression across various cancer types.  We explore the impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in identifying driver mutations, actionable biomarkers, and predictive factors for therapeutic response.  Furthermore, we discuss the development and clinical translation of targeted therapies, immunotherapy approaches informed by genomic profiling, and emerging strategies such as gene editing and CAR T-cell therapy. Finally, we analyze the challenges and ethical considerations associated with implementing personalized cancer medicine, including accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and the need for standardized data sharing and interpretation.  This review highlights the significant potential of genetic insights to transform cancer treatment, moving towards a future of precision oncology tailored to individual patient needs.
