Advances in genomic sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, paving the way for personalized medicine approaches.  Cancer is fundamentally a disease of somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting key regulatory pathways controlling cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.  High-throughput sequencing technologies now allow for comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, identifying driver mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic alterations specific to individual patients. This detailed characterization allows for the identification of actionable mutations that can be targeted with specific therapies, moving beyond traditional, broad-spectrum chemotherapies.  For example, the presence of EGFR mutations in lung cancer predicts response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while identification of BRAF V600E mutations in melanoma dictates treatment with BRAF inhibitors.  However,  inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity pose significant challenges, as subpopulations of cancer cells may harbour diverse genetic profiles, potentially leading to treatment resistance.  Ongoing research focuses on developing strategies to overcome this heterogeneity, including liquid biopsies for minimally invasive monitoring of circulating tumor DNA and the development of multi-targeted therapies addressing multiple driver mutations simultaneously.  Ultimately, the integration of genomic profiling with clinical data promises to further refine personalized cancer treatment and improve patient outcomes.
