Organ transplantation, a life-saving medical marvel, is inextricably intertwined with complex ethical dilemmas demanding interdisciplinary scrutiny.  This paper explores the multifaceted ethical considerations inherent in organ transplantation, highlighting the crucial contributions of various disciplines beyond medicine. While medical advancements have significantly improved transplant success rates, procuring organs remains a fraught process raising critical issues of justice, autonomy, and beneficence.  The allocation of scarce resources necessitates input from economists and policy makers, grappling with questions of fairness and equitable distribution amidst competing needs.  Furthermore, the psychological impact on donors and recipients, both living and deceased, demands attention from psychologists and social workers, exploring the emotional burdens and long-term consequences.  Philosophical perspectives, addressing concepts of personhood and the definition of death, are crucial in shaping policies surrounding organ donation.  This research, therefore, adopts an interdisciplinary approach, integrating insights from medicine, law, economics, psychology, sociology, and philosophy to provide a comprehensive analysis of ethical challenges faced in organ transplantation and to propose potential frameworks for more equitable and just practices.
