Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents a significant challenge to personalized medicine. While advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, translating this information into effective therapies remains difficult.  Identifying driver mutations responsible for oncogenesis amidst numerous passenger mutations requires sophisticated bioinformatic analysis and robust validation.  Furthermore, the intratumoral heterogeneity, where different cancer cells within a single tumor exhibit diverse genetic profiles, complicates treatment strategies targeting specific mutations.  Experimental challenges include developing reliable preclinical models that accurately mimic the complexity of human tumors, encompassing both genetic and microenvironmental factors.  Assessing the functional impact of identified mutations through in vitro and in vivo assays often proves laborious and time-consuming.  Finally, translating promising preclinical findings into successful clinical trials faces hurdles related to patient selection, trial design, and the accurate assessment of response biomarkers. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer therapies.
