Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution, driven by advancements across multiple disciplines.  Early MIS, exemplified by laparoscopy, relied on rudimentary instrumentation and 2D visualization, limiting dexterity and precision.  Subsequent progress stemmed from interdisciplinary collaborations.  Engineering contributed to improved instrumentation, including smaller, more articulated instruments and advanced energy sources like lasers and ultrasound.  Material science provided biocompatible polymers for improved sutures and implants.  Imaging breakthroughs, such as 3D and fluorescence-guided endoscopy and robotic-assisted systems, enhanced visualization and surgical control.  Simultaneously, advancements in computer science, particularly in image processing and robotics, enabled the development of sophisticated robotic platforms offering increased precision and dexterity exceeding human capabilities.  Further interdisciplinary synergy between surgeons, engineers, computer scientists, and material scientists has resulted in the emergence of novel techniques like single-port surgery and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), demonstrating the continued evolution of MIS towards enhanced patient outcomes through minimally traumatic approaches.  Future research should focus on the integration of artificial intelligence and augmented reality to further refine surgical precision and training.
