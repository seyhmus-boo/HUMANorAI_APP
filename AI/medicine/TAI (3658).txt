Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, is rapidly transforming modern healthcare delivery. This lecture explores telemedicine's multifaceted role, encompassing remote patient monitoring (RPM), telehealth consultations, and virtual rehabilitation.  RPM utilizes wearable sensors and connected devices to transmit patient data, enabling proactive intervention and improved disease management, particularly beneficial for chronic conditions.  Telehealth consultations, facilitated via videoconferencing and secure messaging, enhance accessibility, especially for patients in geographically isolated areas or with mobility limitations.  Virtual rehabilitation leverages interactive platforms for delivering physical and occupational therapy remotely, promoting patient engagement and adherence.  While challenges remain regarding reimbursement models, data security, and regulatory frameworks, telemedicine demonstrably improves patient outcomes, reduces healthcare costs, and enhances overall healthcare system efficiency.  Further research should focus on optimizing these platforms and addressing the persistent disparities in access to digital technologies.
