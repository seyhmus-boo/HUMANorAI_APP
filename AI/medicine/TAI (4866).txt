Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting concerning trends toward increased prevalence and severity.  Anxiety and depression are particularly prevalent, often co-occurring and impacting academic performance, social functioning, and future well-being.  Risk factors are multifaceted, encompassing genetic predispositions, environmental stressors (e.g., trauma, social media), and societal influences.  Understanding these necessitates an interdisciplinary approach.  Psychiatry provides diagnostic frameworks and pharmacotherapeutic interventions, while psychology offers evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).  Social work contributes by addressing systemic issues impacting mental health, including poverty and access to resources.  Furthermore, the crucial role of family and peer support highlights the need for collaboration with educational and community settings.  Effective treatment increasingly involves integrated care models, combining medication management, individual and group therapy, family therapy, and school-based interventions, reflecting a recognition of the interconnectedness of biological, psychological, and social factors influencing adolescent mental health.  Future research should focus on improving early detection, developing culturally sensitive interventions, and strengthening interprofessional collaboration to optimize outcomes.
