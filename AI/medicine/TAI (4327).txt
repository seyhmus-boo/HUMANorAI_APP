Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell's genome, disrupting crucial cellular processes like growth regulation and apoptosis.  Advances in genomics have significantly elucidated the genetic basis of cancer heterogeneity, revealing diverse driver mutations across different cancer types and even within individual tumors.  This understanding underpins the burgeoning field of personalized medicine in oncology.

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows for comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, identifying specific mutations, copy number variations, and gene expression patterns. This information enables the prediction of a patient's response to targeted therapies. For instance, identifying EGFR mutations in lung cancer guides the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Similarly, identification of specific rearrangements, like BCR-ABL fusion in leukemia, informs the use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors like imatinib.  Beyond targeted therapies, genomic profiling aids in prognosis prediction, facilitating tailored treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes.  Ongoing research focuses on improving the accuracy and cost-effectiveness of genomic testing, ultimately leading to more precise and effective cancer treatments tailored to individual genetic profiles.
