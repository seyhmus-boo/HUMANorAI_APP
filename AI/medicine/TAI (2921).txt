Antibiotic resistance, a critical global health threat, represents a profound reversal of a 20th-century medical triumph.  Since the discovery of penicillin in the 1920s, antibiotics revolutionized healthcare, drastically reducing mortality from infectious diseases. However, the widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics has driven the selection and proliferation of resistant bacterial strains. This presentation will trace the historical trajectory of antibiotic discovery and the subsequent emergence of resistance, highlighting key milestones like the rise of methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) and the increasing prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens.  We will examine the multifaceted global implications of this phenomenon, including increased morbidity and mortality, escalating healthcare costs, and the potential for devastating impacts on food security through the threat to livestock production.  The presentation will also briefly address strategies for combating antibiotic resistance, including improved stewardship programs, the development of novel antimicrobial agents, and the crucial role of global collaboration in addressing this complex challenge to public health.  Finally, we will discuss the urgent need for policy changes and public awareness campaigns to mitigate the devastating consequences of unchecked antibiotic resistance.
