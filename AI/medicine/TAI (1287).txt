Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice over the past several decades.  This paper explores the significant evolution of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, highlighting the key technological advancements and their impact on patient outcomes.  Early MIS techniques, primarily driven by laparoscopy, focused on adapting traditional open surgical approaches to a less invasive setting.  However, recent years have witnessed a paradigm shift, driven by the development of sophisticated robotic systems, advanced imaging modalities, and novel instrumentation.  Robotic-assisted surgery, with its enhanced dexterity, precision, and three-dimensional visualization, has broadened the applicability of MIS to complex procedures previously deemed unsuitable.  Simultaneously, advancements in natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-port access techniques continue to push the boundaries of minimally invasive approaches, aiming for even smaller incisions and improved cosmetic results. This review will analyze the progression of these key developments, examining their impact on surgical precision, patient recovery times, complication rates, and the overall trajectory of MIS towards increasingly less invasive interventions.  Furthermore, it will consider the ongoing challenges and future directions of this rapidly evolving field.
