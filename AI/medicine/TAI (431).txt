Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell's genome, disrupting crucial regulatory pathways governing cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.  Advances in genomic sequencing technologies have profoundly impacted our understanding of this genetic basis, revealing the heterogeneous mutational landscapes characteristic of different cancer types.  This increased resolution has facilitated the identification of driver mutations—specific genetic alterations directly contributing to cancer initiation and progression—allowing for more precise stratification of patients. Personalized medicine leverages this knowledge to tailor treatment strategies based on an individual's unique tumor genomic profile.  For example, targeted therapies, designed to inhibit the products of specific oncogenes or restore the function of tumor suppressor genes, show remarkable efficacy in patients harboring the corresponding mutations.  Furthermore, the development of immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, is guided by the identification of tumor-specific neoantigens arising from genomic alterations.  Despite considerable progress, challenges remain in translating genomic data into clinically actionable insights, including the identification of clinically relevant biomarkers and the development of robust predictive models to guide treatment selection and optimize patient outcomes. Future research will focus on improving the cost-effectiveness and accessibility of genomic profiling, as well as integrating multi-omics data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of tumor biology and facilitate the development of even more precise and effective personalized cancer therapies.
