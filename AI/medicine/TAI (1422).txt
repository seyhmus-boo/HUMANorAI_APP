Antibiotic resistance (AR), a global health crisis, threatens the efficacy of antimicrobial therapies, jeopardizing human and animal health.  The widespread dissemination of resistant pathogens, driven by factors including overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agricultural practices, and inadequate infection control, poses significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide.  This resistance manifests across diverse bacterial species, impacting treatment outcomes for a range of infections, from common community-acquired illnesses to life-threatening hospital-acquired infections.  The economic burden is substantial, encompassing increased healthcare costs, prolonged hospital stays, and reduced productivity.  Moreover, the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens threaten global health security, with implications for the management of infectious diseases and the efficacy of surgical procedures. Addressing AR necessitates a multi-pronged approach involving stewardship programs to optimize antibiotic use, investment in research and development of novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapies (e.g., phage therapy), improved sanitation and hygiene practices, and strengthened global surveillance systems for monitoring resistance patterns.  A One Health approach, integrating human, animal, and environmental health strategies, is crucial for effective mitigation of this global challenge.
