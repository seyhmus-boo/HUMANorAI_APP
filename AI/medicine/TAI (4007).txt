Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This advancement, however, has not been without significant experimental challenges.  This paper explores the evolutionary trajectory of surgical techniques within the MIS field, focusing specifically on the hurdles encountered during the research and development process.  Early limitations centered on inadequate visualization and dexterity within the confined surgical space, leading to the development of advanced imaging technologies like laparoscopy and robotic assistance.  The transition to these novel approaches, however, introduced further complexities.  The challenges of achieving precise movements with robotic arms, the inherent two-dimensional limitations of laparoscopy, and the difficulties in translating established open surgical techniques to the MIS environment all required substantial experimental investigation. This paper examines the key experimental challenges encountered across the evolution of MIS techniques, including the development and validation of new instrumentation, the refinement of surgical workflows, and the assessment of long-term outcomes.  By analyzing these challenges, we aim to illuminate the iterative process of innovation within MIS and identify areas requiring continued research.
