The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical global challenge. Historically, while not explicitly termed "climate change," observations of disease patterns linked to environmental shifts existed. For example, Hippocrates noted the influence of climate on disease prevalence.  Today, the impact is far more pronounced and complex.  Climate change, driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, exacerbates existing health threats and creates novel ones.  Rising temperatures increase the geographic range and intensity of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever. Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, lead to injuries, displacement, and mental health issues.  Furthermore, changes in precipitation patterns impact waterborne diseases and food security, indirectly impacting malnutrition and associated health complications.  Air pollution, worsened by climate change, contributes to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease.  Addressing climate change, therefore, is not merely an environmental imperative but a fundamental public health strategy, demanding urgent and multifaceted interventions.
