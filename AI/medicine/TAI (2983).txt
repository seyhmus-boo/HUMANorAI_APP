Cancer, a complex disease with heterogeneous etiology, has long been recognized as having a genetic component. Early research, focusing on familial cancer syndromes, identified germline mutations in genes like BRCA1/2, highlighting the role of inherited predisposition. However, the advent of next-generation sequencing revolutionized our understanding, revealing the somatic mutational landscape of individual tumors. This led to the identification of driver mutations, specific genetic alterations driving tumorigenesis, and passenger mutations, with less functional significance.  This understanding underpins the paradigm shift towards personalized oncology.  Advances in genomic profiling, including whole-exome and RNA sequencing, now allow for the precise characterization of tumor genomes, informing targeted therapies and predictive biomarkers.  For example, identifying EGFR mutations in lung cancer guides treatment with EGFR inhibitors.  However, challenges remain, including the complexity of interpreting complex genomic data, the cost and accessibility of genomic testing, and the emergence of drug resistance driven by further mutations.  Future research will focus on integrating multi-omics data, developing more effective therapeutic strategies targeting specific pathways, and improving accessibility to personalized cancer care to maximize patient benefit.
