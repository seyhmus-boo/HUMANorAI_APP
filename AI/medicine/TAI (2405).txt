Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain complex and multifaceted, demanding ongoing scrutiny.  This presentation will explore key ethical challenges within this critical field, highlighting recent developments and their implications.  Specifically, we will examine the evolving debate surrounding equitable allocation of scarce organs, focusing on the tensions between maximizing utilitarian outcomes and ensuring fairness for all potential recipients.  The increasing role of artificial intelligence in organ allocation algorithms will be critically analyzed, addressing concerns about algorithmic bias and transparency.  Furthermore, we will discuss the ethical dimensions of living donation, including issues of informed consent, coercion, and the potential for exploitation of vulnerable populations.  Recent advancements in xenotransplantation, using organs from non-human sources, raise further ethical dilemmas regarding animal welfare and the potential for zoonotic disease transmission, which will be explored.  Finally, the presentation will briefly address the evolving legal frameworks governing organ transplantation and their implications for ethical practice.  The goal is to stimulate discussion on navigating these complex ethical challenges to ensure a just and equitable system of organ transplantation.
