Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window of vulnerability for the onset of mental health disorders.  Historically, adolescent mental health has been comparatively under-researched, often overshadowed by the focus on childhood or adult pathologies.  Early conceptualizations framed adolescent distress primarily through a developmental lens, emphasizing "storm and stress" as a normative experience, obscuring the prevalence and severity of genuine clinical conditions.  However, recent decades have witnessed a dramatic shift, fueled by improved diagnostic tools, increased awareness, and burgeoning epidemiological research.  This paper examines current trends in the prevalence and presentation of mental health disorders among adolescents, acknowledging the historical context of underrecognition and misdiagnosis.  We explore the shifting landscape of common disorders like anxiety, depression, and substance use, analyzing factors contributing to rising rates, such as societal pressures, technological influences, and evolving diagnostic criteria. Finally, we review and critically evaluate the efficacy of contemporary treatment approaches, including pharmacological interventions, psychotherapies, and integrated care models, highlighting areas requiring further research and innovation to address the growing burden of adolescent mental illness.
