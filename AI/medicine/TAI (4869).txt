Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma compared to open surgery, has revolutionized surgical practice. This paper explores the evolution of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, tracing its progression from its nascent stages to its current sophisticated state.  Early MIS techniques, primarily employing rigid endoscopes and limited instrumentation, were constrained by challenges in dexterity and visualization.  However, the development of advanced imaging modalities, such as high-definition endoscopy and 3D laparoscopy, coupled with the refinement of instrumentation including flexible endoscopes and robotic-assisted systems, has dramatically expanded the scope and capabilities of MIS.

This evolution has led to a significant expansion of practical applications.  Initially confined to specific procedures like cholecystectomy, MIS techniques are now employed across a vast spectrum of surgical specialties, including cardiovascular surgery, urology, gynecology, and neurosurgery.  The benefits are multifaceted, encompassing reduced patient morbidity and mortality, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This paper will analyze the key technological advancements driving this evolution, discuss the impact on patient care, and critically evaluate the ongoing challenges and future directions of minimally invasive surgical techniques.
