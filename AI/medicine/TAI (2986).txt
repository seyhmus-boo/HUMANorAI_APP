Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting fundamental cellular processes like growth and apoptosis.  Advances in genomics have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, revealing diverse driver mutations and complex mutational landscapes across cancer types. This knowledge underpins the burgeoning field of personalized medicine, enabling targeted therapies tailored to an individual's tumor's unique genetic profile. Next-generation sequencing technologies allow for comprehensive genomic profiling, identifying specific oncogenes, tumor suppressor gene inactivation, and microsatellite instability, thereby informing treatment decisions.  For example, the presence of EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma predicts responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Furthermore, immunotherapy strategies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are selectively effective in tumors with specific mutational signatures or high tumor mutational burden.  Ongoing research focuses on improving the accuracy of predictive biomarkers, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and integrating multi-omics data to further refine personalized cancer treatments, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing treatment-related toxicities.  Challenges remain in managing treatment resistance and ensuring equitable access to these advanced technologies.
