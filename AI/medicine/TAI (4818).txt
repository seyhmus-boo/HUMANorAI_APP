Climate change poses a significant and evolving threat to public health, extending far beyond the traditionally recognized impacts.  Historical analyses reveal a long-standing association between climate variability and disease outbreaks, evidenced by cholera epidemics linked to altered rainfall patterns in the 19th century.  However, anthropogenic climate change intensifies these risks, producing a complex interplay of direct and indirect health consequences.  Direct effects include increased heat-related mortality and morbidity, exacerbated by urbanization and aging populations.  Indirectly, climate change alters disease vector distributions, expanding the geographical reach of infectious diseases like malaria and dengue fever.  Changes in precipitation patterns influence waterborne diseases, while extreme weather events lead to injuries, displacement, and mental health challenges.  Furthermore, climate change impacts food security and nutrition, increasing the risk of malnutrition and associated illnesses.  Addressing this complex relationship requires integrated approaches, combining climate mitigation strategies with public health interventions focusing on early warning systems, improved infrastructure, and enhanced disease surveillance.  Future research should prioritize quantifying the specific health burdens attributable to climate change across diverse populations and contexts.
