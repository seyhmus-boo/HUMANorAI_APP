This presentation explores the nascent field of applying quantum mechanical principles to understand the complex relationship between climate change and public health.  While traditionally approached through classical epidemiological and statistical models, we argue that a quantum perspective offers unique insights into the non-linear, probabilistic nature of disease emergence and spread in the context of a changing climate.  We will discuss how superposition, entanglement, and decoherence – concepts fundamental to quantum mechanics – can be used as metaphorical frameworks to describe the intertwined nature of environmental stressors (e.g., extreme weather events, altered vector distributions) and health outcomes (e.g., infectious disease outbreaks, heat-related mortality).  Specifically, we will examine how the superposition of multiple climate-related hazards simultaneously impacting vulnerable populations can lead to unpredictable and potentially catastrophic health consequences. We will also explore the potential application of quantum computing to analyze large, complex datasets on climate-sensitive diseases, facilitating more accurate predictions and optimized resource allocation for public health interventions.  Ultimately, this presentation advocates for the incorporation of quantum-inspired thinking into climate change and public health research, paving the way for more sophisticated and effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.
