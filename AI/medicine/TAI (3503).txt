Cancer is a complex disease driven by somatic genetic alterations.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of its genetic basis, paving the way for personalized medicine approaches.  This presentation will explore the significant progress made in identifying cancer-driving mutations across various tumor types, highlighting the role of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in comprehensive genomic profiling.  We will discuss how the identification of specific driver mutations allows for more precise diagnosis, prognosis, and prediction of treatment response. This knowledge fuels the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which demonstrate improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapies.  Furthermore, we will examine the practical applications of these advancements, including the use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for early detection and monitoring of minimal residual disease.  The integration of genomic data with clinical information through bioinformatics pipelines is enabling the creation of predictive models for treatment stratification and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the challenges and ethical considerations associated with implementing personalized cancer medicine on a larger scale.
