Climate change, driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, presents a multifaceted threat to global public health.  While the impacts are typically analyzed through epidemiological and sociological lenses, this paper explores the nascent field of investigating this relationship through the framework of quantum mechanics.  Although seemingly disparate, the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics offer a unique perspective on several crucial aspects of the climate-health nexus.  We propose that a quantum mechanical approach can provide novel insights into the intricate interactions between environmental stressors exacerbated by climate change and human biological systems at a molecular level. This includes exploring the quantum effects on the behavior of biomolecules involved in disease pathogenesis, the influence of altered electromagnetic fields on cellular processes, and the impact of climate-induced shifts in atmospheric composition on radical-mediated biological damage. This research will not directly involve quantum computation or quantum field theory but rather leverages the foundational principles of quantum mechanics to illuminate the complex interplay between environmental changes and human health at the quantum scale.  Specifically, this paper will examine [briefly mention specific aspects or hypotheses to be examined].  By bridging the gap between classical climate science and quantum biology, we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate and far-reaching consequences of climate change on human well-being.
