Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, extending beyond the traditionally recognized impacts. Recent research underscores increasingly complex relationships.  Extreme weather events, amplified by climate change, directly cause injury and mortality through heatwaves, floods, and wildfires, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.  Indirectly, shifting climate patterns alter disease vectors, expanding the geographical range of infectious diseases like malaria and dengue fever.  Furthermore, changes in air quality, linked to increased wildfire smoke and ground-level ozone, exacerbate respiratory illnesses.  Food insecurity, resulting from altered agricultural yields and water scarcity, contributes to malnutrition and associated health problems.  

Recent developments highlight the escalating urgency.  Studies are increasingly sophisticated in quantifying the attributable mortality and morbidity linked to specific climate-related events.  Focus is shifting toward understanding the interplay between climate change, social determinants of health, and health inequities, revealing amplified vulnerabilities in marginalized communities.  This necessitates integrated, multi-sectoral approaches that address both climate mitigation and adaptation alongside broader social justice initiatives.  Emerging research also emphasizes the mental health impacts of climate-related disasters and prolonged environmental stress, demanding a more holistic understanding of climate change's health consequences.
