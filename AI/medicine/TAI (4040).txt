Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's ability to treat bacterial infections.  This presentation addresses the considerable experimental challenges hindering our understanding and combatting AR.  Current in vitro studies, while crucial for initial screening, often fail to accurately reflect the complex in vivo environment, leading to discrepancies between laboratory findings and clinical efficacy.  The inherent heterogeneity within bacterial populations, including the presence of persister cells and biofilm formation, complicates the assessment of antibiotic susceptibility and the development of effective treatment strategies.  Furthermore, the lack of standardized methodologies for evaluating AR across different research groups hampers data comparison and the identification of consistent trends.  Addressing these experimental challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating advanced techniques such as advanced imaging, single-cell analysis, and sophisticated in vivo models that better mimic the human host response.  Improved standardization of experimental protocols and the development of innovative high-throughput screening methods are also essential.  Only through overcoming these limitations can we effectively tackle the escalating global crisis of antibiotic resistance.
