This presentation addresses the evolving landscape of mental health disorders in adolescents, highlighting key trends and the significant experimental challenges in their effective treatment.  Recent epidemiological studies reveal escalating rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm, particularly among vulnerable populations. These trends necessitate a deeper understanding of the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to disorder onset and maintenance.  Experimental research faces several hurdles.  Firstly, the rapidly developing adolescent brain presents challenges in establishing reliable biomarkers and mechanistic understanding of treatment efficacy. Secondly, the ethical considerations surrounding interventions in this vulnerable population restrict the types of experimental designs that can be employed. Thirdly, the heterogeneity of presentations and comorbidity rates complicate the development of targeted therapies.  This presentation will discuss these challenges, focusing specifically on the difficulties in conducting randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with adequately powered samples, the limitations of current assessment tools, and the need for innovative, ethically sound methodologies such as longitudinal studies employing novel digital phenotyping techniques. We will conclude by exploring promising avenues for future research, emphasizing the need for transdisciplinary collaborations to address this critical public health concern.
