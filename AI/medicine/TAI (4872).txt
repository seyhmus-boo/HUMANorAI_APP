Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant global health concern, exhibiting rising prevalence rates across various diagnoses.  Trends indicate an increase in anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviours, exacerbated by societal factors like increased social media usage, academic pressure, and socio-economic inequalities.  These disorders are rarely isolated, often co-occurring and necessitating an interdisciplinary approach to treatment.

Effective intervention necessitates collaboration between psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and educators.  Psychiatrists provide pharmacological interventions where appropriate, while psychologists employ evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) to address underlying cognitive distortions and emotional dysregulation. Social workers address socio-environmental factors influencing mental health, facilitating family therapy and connecting adolescents with community resources.  Educators play a crucial role in early identification and fostering supportive school environments, promoting mental health literacy and reducing stigma.  This integrated approach, acknowledging the interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors, improves treatment efficacy and long-term outcomes, fostering resilience and promoting holistic adolescent well-being.
