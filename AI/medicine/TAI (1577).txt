Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, undermining modern medicine's capacity to treat bacterial infections.  Driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, as well as agriculture, AR leads to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly concerning in hospital settings, necessitates urgent intervention.  Globally, AR contributes to prolonged hospital stays, higher treatment failures, and the resurgence of previously controllable diseases, disproportionately affecting low- and middle-income countries with limited access to effective treatment and sanitation.

Practical applications to combat AR include implementing stricter antibiotic stewardship programs in healthcare settings, promoting hygiene and sanitation practices to prevent infection, developing rapid diagnostic tools for accurate identification of pathogens and guiding targeted antibiotic use, and accelerating research into novel antimicrobial agents, including bacteriophages and antimicrobial peptides.  Furthermore,  reducing antibiotic use in livestock farming and promoting responsible antibiotic prescribing practices are crucial for mitigating the spread of resistance genes.  International collaboration, robust surveillance systems, and public health education are equally vital to effectively address this complex, global challenge.
