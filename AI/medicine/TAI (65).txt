Mental health disorders in adolescents are a growing global concern, exhibiting complex trends influenced by societal factors, biological vulnerabilities, and developmental transitions.  This summary examines prevalent disorders, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse, noting rising prevalence rates, particularly among girls and marginalized groups.  These increases are linked to intensified academic pressures, social media influence, and socioeconomic disparities.  Treatment approaches are evolving, integrating evidence-based practices such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacology.  However, access to timely and appropriate care remains a significant barrier, particularly in low-resource settings.  Current research highlights the importance of early intervention, emphasizing universal screening programs and the development of trauma-informed care models.  Furthermore, a multi-faceted approach is crucial, encompassing individual therapy, family-based interventions, and school-based support systems.  Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies examining the long-term impact of interventions and explore culturally sensitive approaches to address the diverse needs of adolescent populations.
