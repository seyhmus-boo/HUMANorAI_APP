Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field. This review examines key dilemmas surrounding organ allocation, informed consent, and the commercialization of organs.  Current allocation systems, while striving for equitable distribution based on medical need, often grapple with balancing competing claims and addressing potential biases against certain patient populations.  The crucial role of informed consent, encompassing both donor and recipient perspectives, is highlighted, emphasizing the need for transparent communication and the avoidance of coercion or undue influence.  Concerns surrounding living donation, particularly from vulnerable populations, necessitate rigorous ethical oversight to prevent exploitation. Furthermore, the global black market for organs necessitates international cooperation to combat trafficking and promote ethical procurement practices.  This review underscores the urgent need for continued ethical discourse and robust regulatory frameworks to ensure fairness, justice, and respect for human dignity within the organ transplantation system. Future research should focus on refining allocation algorithms, strengthening safeguards against exploitation, and promoting public awareness to foster responsible organ donation practices.
