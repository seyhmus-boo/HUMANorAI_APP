Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health, challenging the effective treatment of bacterial infections and jeopardizing healthcare advancements.  This review examines the multifaceted nature of AR, exploring its underlying mechanisms, contributing factors, and far-reaching consequences.  The widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, agriculture, and aquaculture has driven the selection and proliferation of resistant strains.  This phenomenon is exacerbated by the limited development pipeline for novel antibiotics, coupled with challenges in diagnostics and infection control practices.  We analyze the global burden of AR, encompassing increased morbidity and mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, and escalating healthcare costs.  Furthermore, this paper investigates the interplay between AR and other global health challenges, including antimicrobial resistance across various pathogens, the rise of multi-drug resistant organisms, and its impact on vulnerable populations.  Finally, we discuss strategies for mitigating AR, focusing on the need for a coordinated global response encompassing improved stewardship, research and development of new therapeutics, and strengthened surveillance systems.
