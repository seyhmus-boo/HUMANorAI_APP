Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, transitioning from initial laparoscopic approaches to increasingly sophisticated methods.  This abstract reviews the evolutionary trajectory of MIS, highlighting key technological advancements and their impact on patient outcomes.  Early laparoscopy, limited by two-dimensional visualization and instrument dexterity, paved the way for robotic-assisted surgery (RAS).  RAS, employing advanced imaging and articulated instruments, enabled greater precision and maneuverability, improving surgical outcomes in complex procedures.  Concurrent developments in imaging, including high-definition 3D laparoscopy and fluorescence imaging, further enhanced surgical visualization and targeting.  Furthermore, the integration of augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) is currently shaping the future of MIS, offering potential for improved surgical planning, real-time guidance, and personalized treatment strategies.  While challenges remain regarding cost-effectiveness and accessibility, ongoing research and technological innovation continue to refine MIS techniques, leading to reduced invasiveness, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and ultimately, improved patient safety and quality of life. Future directions include exploring single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) to further minimize surgical trauma.
