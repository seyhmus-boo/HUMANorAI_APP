Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain complex and dynamic, particularly within the context of experimental advancements. This presentation will explore the emerging ethical challenges posed by innovative transplantation techniques, focusing on three key areas. First, we will examine the ethical implications of xenotransplantation, considering the potential for zoonotic disease transmission and the inherent moral status assigned to animals. Second, the presentation will address the ethical dilemmas surrounding the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) in organ generation, including issues of consent,  potential for commercial exploitation, and the equitable access to resulting therapies. Finally, we will discuss the evolving landscape of organ allocation, analyzing the ethical tensions between maximizing utilitarian benefits and upholding principles of justice and fairness, particularly in the context of novel organ sources and technologies.  The presentation will argue that robust ethical frameworks, incorporating principles of transparency, accountability, and patient autonomy, are crucial for navigating the experimental frontier of transplantation and ensuring responsible innovation in this life-saving field.
