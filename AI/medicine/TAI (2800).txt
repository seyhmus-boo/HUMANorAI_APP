The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical global challenge.  Historically, environmental hazards have always impacted human health, but the scale and speed of anthropogenic climate change exacerbate existing vulnerabilities and introduce novel threats.  Rising temperatures, driven by greenhouse gas emissions, directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Furthermore, shifting climate patterns influence the geographical distribution and prevalence of infectious diseases, with vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever expanding their range.

Indirect impacts are equally significant.  Extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, disrupt sanitation infrastructure, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases and malnutrition.  Sea level rise leads to displacement and increased competition for resources, potentially fostering social unrest and exacerbating existing health inequalities.  Air pollution, worsened by climate change, contributes to respiratory illnesses.  Therefore, mitigating climate change is not merely an environmental imperative but a crucial public health intervention, demanding proactive adaptation strategies and global collaborative efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
