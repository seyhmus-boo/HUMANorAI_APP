Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and multifaceted area demanding ongoing scrutiny. This review examines key ethical dilemmas arising throughout the transplantation process, from donor consent and determination of death to allocation of scarce organs and the potential for exploitation of vulnerable populations.  The inherent tension between individual autonomy and societal benefit is explored, particularly concerning the definition of death and the implications for organ procurement.  Issues surrounding equitable access, including socioeconomic disparities influencing waitlist prioritization and transplantation outcomes, are critically analyzed. Furthermore, the review discusses the ethical implications of commercialization, the potential for coercion and undue influence in living donation, and the psychological and social well-being of both recipients and donor families.  While significant progress has been made in establishing ethical guidelines, persistent challenges remain, requiring ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue and the development of robust, transparent, and culturally sensitive policies to ensure justice and fairness within organ transplantation systems. Future research should focus on enhancing the equitable distribution of organs and mitigating the risks of exploitation, prioritizing the well-being of all involved parties.
