Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents a significant hurdle in developing truly personalized medicine. While genomic sequencing offers unprecedented insight into tumor-specific mutations driving oncogenesis, translating these findings into effective therapies remains challenging. This presentation will explore key experimental obstacles hindering progress in this field.  We will discuss the limitations of current sequencing technologies in comprehensively capturing the complex mutational landscape, including the detection of low-frequency variants and structural variations crucial for therapeutic response prediction. Furthermore, the challenges associated with functional validation of identified mutations, particularly in the context of complex intra-tumoral heterogeneity, will be highlighted.  We will address the difficulties of modelling *in vitro* and *in vivo* the intricate interplay between somatic mutations, the tumor microenvironment, and the immune system.  Finally, the presentation will discuss the need for improved bioinformatics tools and analytical methods to effectively interpret the vast amounts of genomic data generated and integrate this information with clinical data for optimal patient stratification and treatment selection.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is critical for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer medicine.
