Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and multifaceted global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  This complex issue transcends the boundaries of medicine, encompassing agricultural practices, environmental science, and social sciences.  The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine drive the selection and proliferation of resistant strains, impacting healthcare systems globally.  Agricultural practices, particularly the routine use of antibiotics in livestock farming, further contribute to the dissemination of resistant genes into the environment.  Environmental scientists highlight the persistence of antibiotic residues and resistant bacteria in soil and water, facilitating the spread of resistance within and between ecosystems.  Socioeconomic factors, such as access to healthcare, sanitation, and education, influence infection rates and antibiotic usage patterns, exacerbating the problem disproportionately in low- and middle-income countries.  Effective strategies to combat AR necessitate collaboration across disciplines, integrating advancements in diagnostics, drug discovery, public health interventions, and socio-behavioural change programs.  Only through such a holistic and interconnected approach can the global challenge of antibiotic resistance be effectively addressed.
