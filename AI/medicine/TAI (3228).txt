Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice.  Its evolution traces back to early endoscopic techniques in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, initially limited by rudimentary instrumentation and visualization.  The development of fiber optics in the mid-20th century significantly advanced laparoscopy, enabling improved visualization of internal organs and facilitating basic procedures.  Subsequent advancements included the introduction of smaller diameter laparoscopes, improved energy sources (e.g., monopolar and bipolar electrocautery, ultrasonic dissection), and refined surgical instruments enabling dexterity within confined spaces.  The advent of robotic surgery in the late 20th and early 21st centuries marked a paradigm shift, offering enhanced precision, dexterity, and three-dimensional visualization.  This technological progression has expanded the scope of MIS to encompass a wider range of complex procedures, previously confined to open surgery.  Concurrent developments in imaging modalities (e.g., ultrasound, MRI) further augment MIS by providing real-time anatomical guidance.  Ongoing research focuses on improving robotic platforms, developing novel energy sources, and exploring augmented and virtual reality applications to further refine and expand the capabilities of MIS, ultimately aiming for enhanced patient outcomes and reduced postoperative morbidity.
