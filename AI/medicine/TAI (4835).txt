Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This presentation explores the complex interplay between climate change and public health outcomes, highlighting critical interdisciplinary links.  We examine the direct impacts of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, on morbidity and mortality, drawing upon epidemiological data and disaster response research.  Furthermore, we analyze the indirect effects, including the impact on vector-borne diseases, air quality, food security, and mental health, requiring insights from ecology, environmental science, and social psychology.  The presentation will also discuss the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in developing effective public health interventions.  This involves integrating climate modelling with public health planning, utilizing geographical information systems to identify vulnerable populations, and fostering effective communication strategies to enhance public awareness and preparedness. By bridging disciplinary boundaries, we can develop more comprehensive and effective strategies to protect public health in the face of a changing climate.  The presentation concludes by outlining future research priorities emphasizing the need for integrated, transdisciplinary research approaches.
