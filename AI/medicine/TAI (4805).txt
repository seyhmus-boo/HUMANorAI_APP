Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting key regulatory pathways controlling cell growth and differentiation.  Advances in genomics have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, revealing diverse mutational landscapes across cancer types. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies facilitate comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenomes, identifying driver mutations crucial for tumorigenesis.  This has fueled the development of personalized medicine approaches.  Identifying specific oncogenic mutations allows for targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for EGFR-mutated lung cancer, improving efficacy and minimizing adverse effects compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Furthermore, analysis of tumor mutational burden (TMB) informs immunotherapy selection, with high TMB predicting better response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.  Ongoing research focuses on integrating multi-omic data to further refine predictive biomarkers and develop novel therapeutic strategies, including gene editing and CAR T-cell therapies, ultimately aiming to tailor cancer treatment to individual patient genetic profiles for improved outcomes.
