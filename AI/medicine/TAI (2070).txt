Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, promising significant advancements in diagnostics.  However, the integration of AI into clinical practice faces substantial experimental challenges hindering the reliable and widespread adoption of these technologies.  This paper investigates these crucial experimental hurdles, focusing on the limitations that impede the development and validation of robust AI diagnostic tools.  Specifically, we address the challenges associated with data acquisition and quality, encompassing issues of data bias, heterogeneity, and scarcity, particularly in underrepresented populations.  Furthermore, we explore the difficulties in establishing reliable ground truth for algorithm training and evaluation, highlighting the subjectivity inherent in human diagnosis and the complexities of defining gold standard benchmarks across diverse clinical contexts.  Finally, we examine the challenges in ensuring the generalizability and explainability of AI models, addressing the limitations of black-box algorithms and the need for transparent and interpretable diagnostic processes.  Addressing these experimental challenges is paramount to realizing the full potential of AI in improving the accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of healthcare diagnostics.
