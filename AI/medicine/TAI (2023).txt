Cancer's genetic basis, initially understood through the identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, has profoundly impacted personalized medicine.  Early research, focusing on broad genetic alterations like chromosomal instability, laid the foundation. However, the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies revolutionized the field, enabling comprehensive genomic profiling of individual tumors. This allows identification of specific driver mutations, unique to each patient's cancer, which contribute to its growth and progression.

This understanding underpins the development of targeted therapies.  Instead of utilizing cytotoxic chemotherapy affecting all rapidly dividing cells, personalized medicine leverages drugs designed to specifically inhibit the activity of identified mutated proteins, maximizing efficacy and minimizing adverse effects.  Furthermore, pharmacogenomics, integrating an individual's genetic makeup with drug response, allows for the prediction of treatment efficacy and toxicity, further optimizing treatment selection.  Ongoing research focuses on incorporating epigenetic alterations and the tumor microenvironment into personalized cancer treatment strategies, promising even more precise and effective approaches in the future.
