Antibiotic resistance, the capacity of bacteria to withstand antimicrobial drugs, poses a significant and escalating global health threat.  This review summarizes the critical implications of this phenomenon, highlighting its profound impact on healthcare systems and global economies. The widespread misuse and overuse of antibiotics, coupled with insufficient development of new antimicrobials, have fueled the rise of resistant strains, rendering previously treatable infections increasingly difficult to manage. This leads to prolonged illness, increased mortality, and substantial healthcare costs associated with extended hospital stays and more expensive treatment options.  

The consequences extend beyond individual health, impacting public health infrastructure and economic productivity.  Practical applications to mitigate this crisis include robust infection control measures in healthcare settings, promoting responsible antibiotic stewardship through improved prescribing practices and public education, and investing heavily in research and development of novel antimicrobials and alternative therapeutic strategies such as phage therapy and immunotherapies.  Addressing this multifaceted challenge requires a global, coordinated effort involving policymakers, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the public to ensure the continued effectiveness of antibiotics and safeguard global health security.
