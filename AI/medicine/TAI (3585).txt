Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times.  This presentation traces the evolution of MIS, focusing on key technological advancements and their impact on surgical outcomes.  We will explore the transition from early laparoscopic approaches, characterized by limited dexterity and visualization, to the current era of robotic-assisted surgery and advanced imaging modalities. The development of smaller instruments, enhanced camera systems (e.g., 3D and 4K), and improved energy sources will be highlighted, alongside their contributions to improved precision and reduced complication rates.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the influence of evolving surgical training methodologies, emphasizing simulation and virtual reality techniques in developing surgeon proficiency in MIS.  Finally, we will discuss emerging trends in MIS, including single-port surgery, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), and artificial intelligence-assisted surgery, and consider their potential to further refine surgical precision and patient outcomes.  The overall aim is to provide an overview of the remarkable progress made in MIS and to identify future directions in this rapidly evolving field.
