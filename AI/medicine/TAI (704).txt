Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, prioritizing smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery times.  This presentation traces the evolution of MIS techniques, highlighting key advancements from initial laparoscopic approaches to the sophisticated robotic and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) procedures available today.  Early limitations, such as restricted dexterity and visualization, spurred the development of enhanced instrumentation, including articulated laparoscopes and robotic surgical systems offering improved precision and control.

Recent developments focus on enhancing precision and minimizing invasiveness further.  Robotic platforms now integrate advanced imaging technologies like augmented reality and AI-assisted image processing, improving surgical accuracy and facilitating complex procedures.  Single-port and scarless surgery techniques continue to gain traction, minimizing visible scarring and potentially reducing complications.  Simultaneously, NOTES, while still in its development phase, promises to completely eliminate external incisions, significantly impacting patient outcomes.  This presentation will discuss the advantages and limitations of these evolving techniques, analyzing their impact on patient care and future directions for minimally invasive surgical practice, particularly considering the integration of artificial intelligence and advanced imaging.
