Antibiotic resistance (AR), a critical global health threat, arises from the widespread use and misuse of antibiotics, driving the selection and evolution of resistant microorganisms.  This phenomenon significantly compromises the efficacy of existing antimicrobial therapies, leading to prolonged illnesses, increased morbidity and mortality, and escalating healthcare costs.  The global implications are far-reaching, impacting vulnerable populations disproportionately, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) with limited access to quality healthcare and robust infection control measures.  The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, including extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pan-drug resistant (PDR) bacteria, poses a serious challenge to modern medicine, threatening the effectiveness of treatments for a broad range of infections.  Contributing factors include the agricultural use of antibiotics, inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, and a lack of novel antibiotic development.  Addressing AR requires a multi-pronged approach encompassing enhanced infection prevention and control strategies, responsible antibiotic stewardship programs, accelerated research and development of new antimicrobials and alternative therapies, and global collaboration to strengthen surveillance and monitoring systems.  Failure to implement comprehensive strategies will result in a post-antibiotic era with devastating consequences for global health security.
