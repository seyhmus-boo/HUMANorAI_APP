Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective understanding and mitigation.  This research paper examines the complex relationship between climate change and its cascading impacts on human well-being, moving beyond a singular focus on specific health outcomes. We argue that a truly comprehensive analysis necessitates the integration of insights from diverse fields, including climatology, epidemiology, sociology, economics, and political science.  The paper explores how alterations in temperature and precipitation patterns, increased frequency of extreme weather events, and changes in vector-borne disease distribution directly affect morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, it investigates the indirect consequences, such as impacts on food security, water scarcity, displacement, and mental health, highlighting the crucial role of social determinants of health in mediating climate change's effects. By examining the interplay between environmental shifts and socio-economic vulnerabilities, we aim to illuminate the urgent need for collaborative, interdisciplinary strategies to build climate resilience and protect public health in the face of a changing climate.  This integrated approach is essential for developing effective policy interventions and promoting equitable adaptation and mitigation efforts.
