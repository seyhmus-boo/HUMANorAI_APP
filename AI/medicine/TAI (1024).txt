Adolescents experience a disproportionately high burden of mental health disorders, with prevalence rates steadily increasing globally.  This abstract examines recent trends in the presentation and diagnosis of common disorders, including anxiety, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), highlighting variations across sociodemographic groups and geographical regions.  While diagnostic criteria remain relatively stable, advancements in neuroimaging and genetic research are improving our understanding of underlying etiologies, paving the way for more personalized treatment approaches.  Current evidence supports the efficacy of various interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medication (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors for depression), and family-based therapies.  However, access to timely and appropriate care remains a significant barrier, particularly for marginalized populations.  Future research should focus on early identification strategies, accessible and culturally sensitive interventions, and the development of novel therapeutic modalities, such as digital mental health platforms.  Practical applications include implementing school-based screening programs, training educators and healthcare providers in mental health literacy, and increasing funding for community-based mental health services to ensure equitable access to evidence-based care.
