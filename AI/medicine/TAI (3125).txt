Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting concerning upward trends globally.  This abstract reviews recent epidemiological data highlighting increasing prevalence rates for anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors among young people.  Contributing factors are complex and multifaceted, encompassing genetic predispositions, socio-environmental stressors (e.g., social media influence, academic pressure, family dynamics), and societal changes.  While traditional therapeutic approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy remain efficacious,  innovative treatments are gaining traction. These include mindfulness-based interventions, digital mental health platforms offering accessibility and anonymity, and advancements in pharmacotherapy, particularly for severe cases.  However, significant disparities persist in access to quality mental healthcare, particularly for marginalized youth.  Future research should focus on early intervention strategies, culturally sensitive treatment modalities, and the development of robust prevention programs targeting modifiable risk factors to mitigate the escalating burden of adolescent mental health disorders.  Addressing these challenges necessitates a multi-pronged approach involving collaboration between healthcare providers, educators, policymakers, and families.
