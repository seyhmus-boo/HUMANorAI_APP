Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting crucial cellular processes like growth regulation and apoptosis.  The genetic basis of cancer is extraordinarily complex, involving diverse driver mutations across numerous genes.  Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized our understanding, allowing for comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, identifying specific mutations driving individual cancers.  This has fueled the development of personalized medicine approaches.

Recent advancements include the identification of actionable mutations, facilitating targeted therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for specific oncogenic mutations in lung or colorectal cancer.  Immunotherapy, leveraging the patient's immune system to target cancer cells, has also been significantly advanced by genomic profiling, allowing for predictive biomarkers like tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) to identify patients likely to respond.  Furthermore, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis offers minimally invasive methods for monitoring disease progression and treatment response, enabling dynamic adjustments to personalized treatment strategies.  While challenges remain in interpreting complex genomic data and addressing drug resistance, the integration of genomics into oncology is fundamentally transforming cancer care.
