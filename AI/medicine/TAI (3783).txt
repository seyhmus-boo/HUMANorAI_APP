Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery times, represents a paradigm shift in surgical practice.  Its evolution, however, is not a linear progression but a complex interplay of technological advancements and evolving surgical philosophies. This paper explores the historical trajectory of MIS techniques, tracing their development from rudimentary approaches to the sophisticated procedures employed today.  Early examples, such as the pioneering work of Jacques-Louis Reverdin in the 19th century with endoscopic approaches, laid a crucial foundational groundwork.  However, the true genesis of modern MIS can be attributed to the advent of fiberoptic endoscopy in the mid-20th century, enabling visualization within the body cavity.  Subsequently, the development of laparoscopy, initially limited to diagnostic procedures, gradually expanded to encompass a wider range of therapeutic interventions.  This expansion was facilitated by significant advancements in instrumentation, including the refinement of endoscopic tools, the introduction of specialized cameras, and the development of advanced energy sources for tissue dissection and hemostasis. This research will investigate the key technological milestones and conceptual shifts that have driven the evolution of MIS, analyzing their impact on surgical outcomes, patient experience, and the broader landscape of healthcare delivery.
