Adolescent mental health disorders are exhibiting concerning trends, with rising rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm globally.  Contributing factors include societal pressures, increased screen time, and the impact of adverse childhood experiences.  Treatment approaches are evolving, moving beyond traditional talk therapy.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) remains a cornerstone, but personalized interventions are gaining traction, informed by advancements in neuroimaging and genetics.  Digital mental health platforms offer accessibility and anonymity, providing self-guided CBT programs and telehealth options.  Pharmacological interventions, while controversial for adolescent populations, are increasingly targeted, with a focus on minimizing side effects and optimizing efficacy through personalized medicine.  However, a significant gap remains in access to timely and appropriate care, particularly in underserved communities. Future research should prioritize early intervention strategies, focusing on preventative measures and the development of more robust digital tools that improve adherence and facilitate proactive care.
