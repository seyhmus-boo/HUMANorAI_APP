Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma compared to open surgery, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This paper examines the significant evolutionary trajectory of surgical techniques within MIS, tracing its development from early pioneering efforts to the sophisticated technological advancements prevalent today.  The evolution has been driven by a relentless pursuit of improved patient outcomes, encompassing reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times.  This progress has been facilitated by parallel advancements in imaging technology, instrumentation, and surgical robotics.  We will explore the key milestones in this evolution, including the introduction of laparoscopy, the refinement of endoscopic techniques, and the integration of robotic-assisted surgery.  Practical applications examined will span diverse surgical specialties, focusing on the impact of these advancements on procedures such as cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery, and cardiac surgery.  By analyzing the historical context and technological innovations, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolution of MIS techniques and their profound influence on contemporary surgical practice and patient care.
