Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are traditionally framed within classical bioethics, focusing on donor consent, recipient selection, and resource allocation.  However, a quantum mechanical perspective offers a novel lens through which to examine these long-standing dilemmas.  This presentation argues that the inherent uncertainty and entanglement present in quantum phenomena offer parallels to the complex, interconnected nature of organ transplantation.  The "measurement problem" in quantum mechanics, where observation influences the system, mirrors the ethical challenges surrounding donor anonymity and the potential impact of transplantation on the recipient's identity and sense of self.  Furthermore, the entanglement of the donor's life with the organ's fate raises questions about the boundaries of personhood and the ethical implications of transferring potentially entangled biological information.  This presentation will explore how the conceptual framework of quantum mechanics, particularly the notions of superposition, entanglement, and observer effects, can illuminate the ethical complexities of organ transplantation, enriching existing bioethical discourse and prompting a re-evaluation of established practices.  We will suggest avenues for future research, highlighting the potential for a quantum-informed bioethics to navigate these increasingly intricate ethical challenges.
