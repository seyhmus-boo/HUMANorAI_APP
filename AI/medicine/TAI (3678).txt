Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, extending far beyond the commonly understood impacts of extreme weather events. This research paper explores the intricate relationship between a changing climate and human health outcomes, moving beyond a simple correlation to examine the complex interplay of environmental shifts and their cascading effects on disease prevalence, morbidity, and mortality.  We will analyze the diverse mechanisms through which climate change impacts health, encompassing direct effects like heat stress and the spread of vector-borne diseases, as well as indirect effects such as food insecurity, water scarcity, and mental health consequences arising from displacement and environmental degradation.  This investigation will consider both the current observable impacts and projected future scenarios, highlighting regional variations and vulnerable populations.  Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the development of evidence-based strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation in the context of public health. Practical applications stemming from this research will include informing the design of effective public health interventions, improving early warning systems for climate-sensitive health risks, and advocating for policy changes to protect vulnerable populations and build climate-resilient healthcare systems.
