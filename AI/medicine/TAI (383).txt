Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting crucial cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis.  Advances in genomics have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, revealing a complex interplay of driver and passenger mutations across numerous genes.  High-throughput sequencing technologies, including whole-genome and exome sequencing, now allow for comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, identifying specific mutations driving individual cancers. This has fuelled the development of personalized medicine approaches, moving beyond traditional, genotype-agnostic therapies.  Identifying specific driver mutations permits targeted therapy selection, maximizing efficacy while minimizing off-target effects.  For example, the presence of EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma informs the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Furthermore, genomic profiling facilitates the prediction of therapeutic response and the identification of patients at risk of developing specific cancers, enabling preventative strategies. However, challenges remain, including the heterogeneity of tumors, the identification of therapeutically actionable mutations, and the need for robust bioinformatic tools to analyze the vast datasets generated.  Future research will focus on integrating multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) to refine diagnostic and therapeutic strategies and ultimately improve cancer patient outcomes through truly personalized approaches.
