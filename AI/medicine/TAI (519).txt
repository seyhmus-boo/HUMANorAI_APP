The efficacy of vaccination in preventing infectious diseases rests upon a complex interplay of biological, sociological, and economic factors. Biologically, vaccines stimulate the immune system, generating immunological memory that rapidly neutralises future encounters with the target pathogen. This immunological principle, underpinning vaccinology, is intrinsically linked to immunology and microbiology.  

Sociologically, vaccine uptake is influenced by public health initiatives, trust in healthcare systems, and the spread of misinformation.  Understanding vaccine hesitancy requires insights from sociology and psychology, informing effective communication strategies and addressing concerns regarding safety and efficacy. Economically, vaccination programmes necessitate substantial investment in research, development, manufacturing, and distribution, necessitating cost-benefit analyses informed by economics and public health policy.  Therefore, successful vaccination programmes require a holistic, interdisciplinary approach that integrates biological understanding with effective societal engagement and sustainable resource allocation.
