Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the inextricable link between climate change and public health.  Think of the Earth's climate system as a finely balanced ecosystem; climate change acts as a disruptive force, upsetting this delicate balance with cascading consequences for human wellbeing.

Rising temperatures, analogous to a fever in a human body, can exacerbate existing health problems like cardiovascular disease and respiratory illnesses.  Heatwaves, akin to a severe infection, can cause direct mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns, much like fluctuating hormone levels, impact the spread of infectious diseases, with vector-borne illnesses flourishing in altered conditions.

Furthermore, extreme weather events, the equivalent of catastrophic injuries, such as floods and hurricanes, cause displacement, trauma, and injury, placing immense strain on healthcare systems.  Finally, consider food security;  shifts in agricultural yields, comparable to nutritional deficiencies, lead to malnutrition and related health issues.  In essence, climate change is not merely an environmental problem; it is a profound and pervasive public health crisis requiring urgent and multifaceted interventions.
