Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting concerning upward trends in prevalence across recent decades.  This lecture will examine key epidemiological shifts, focusing on the increased rates of anxiety disorders, depression, and self-harm behaviors, particularly amongst female adolescents and marginalized groups.  Contributing factors, such as social media influence, academic pressures, and societal inequalities, will be discussed, highlighting the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social determinants.  Treatment modalities will be reviewed, emphasizing the efficacy of evidence-based interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacological approaches, tailored to the developmental stage and specific needs of the adolescent.  The lecture will also address the crucial role of early identification, timely intervention, and the importance of collaborative care involving families, schools, and mental health professionals in improving outcomes and mitigating long-term consequences associated with untreated adolescent mental health disorders.  Finally, current research gaps and future directions for research and policy will be explored.
