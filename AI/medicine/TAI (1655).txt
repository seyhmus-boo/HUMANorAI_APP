Adolescents are experiencing a concerning rise in mental health disorders, demanding innovative and collaborative approaches to treatment. This presentation will explore recent trends in the prevalence and presentation of common adolescent mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, highlighting the influence of societal factors such as increased screen time and social media usage.  We will discuss the limitations of traditional, siloed approaches to care and emphasize the critical need for interdisciplinary collaboration.  Specifically, the presentation will examine the benefits of integrated models involving psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, educators, and family therapists.  Examples of successful interdisciplinary interventions, such as collaborative care models and school-based mental health services, will be showcased.  Furthermore, we will explore the growing importance of incorporating technological advancements, including telehealth and digital mental health platforms, within interdisciplinary frameworks to improve access and outcomes. Finally, we will address future directions for research and practice, focusing on the development of culturally sensitive and equitable interventions that address the unique needs of diverse adolescent populations.
