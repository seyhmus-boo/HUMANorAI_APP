Cancer is a complex disease driven by somatic genetic alterations, necessitating a shift towards personalized medicine. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, enabling comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes and transcriptomes. This has led to the identification of numerous driver mutations and fusion genes specific to different cancer types and subtypes, facilitating the development of targeted therapies.  Advances in liquid biopsies, utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), offer minimally invasive methods for real-time monitoring of disease progression and treatment response, enabling dynamic therapeutic adjustments.  Furthermore, the integration of multi-omics data, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and epigenomics, allows for a more holistic understanding of tumor heterogeneity and the identification of novel therapeutic targets.  While challenges remain regarding cost-effectiveness and accessibility, the ongoing development of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven analytical tools promises to accelerate the interpretation of complex genomic data and personalize cancer treatment strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes.  The future of cancer treatment lies in leveraging this burgeoning field of personalized oncology.
