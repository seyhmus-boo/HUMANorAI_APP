Organ transplantation offers life-saving benefits, yet its practice raises complex ethical dilemmas. This presentation examines key ethical considerations in contemporary organ transplantation, highlighting recent developments shaping the field.  We will explore the persistent challenge of equitable organ allocation, discussing the evolution of allocation systems beyond MELD/ELD scores and the growing consideration of factors such as social determinants of health and geographic disparities.  Furthermore, we will analyze the ethical implications of expanding donor pools, including the debate surrounding deceased donation after circulatory determination (DCD) and the potential for increased donation from living donors, considering vulnerabilities to coercion and exploitation.  The increasingly sophisticated technologies of organ preservation and xenotransplantation introduce further ethical complexities, particularly regarding risk assessment, resource allocation, and the potential for unforeseen consequences.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the ongoing ethical debate surrounding the commercialization of organs and the role of international collaborations in mitigating ethical challenges within a globalized context.  The presentation will conclude by emphasizing the need for ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue to ensure ethical and equitable access to life-saving organ transplantation.
