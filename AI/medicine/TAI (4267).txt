Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting crucial regulatory pathways.  Advances in genomics have revolutionized our understanding of this genetic heterogeneity, revealing distinct driver mutations and pathways implicated in various cancer types. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies now enable comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenomes, facilitating the identification of specific genetic alterations underpinning individual cancers. This has paved the way for personalized medicine, moving beyond a "one-size-fits-all" approach to chemotherapy.

Personalized cancer therapies leverage this genomic information to guide treatment selection. Targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immunotherapy agents (e.g., immune checkpoint inhibitors), are designed to specifically target identified driver mutations or exploit tumor-specific neoantigens.  Furthermore, pharmacogenomic analyses predict individual responses to chemotherapeutic agents, minimizing adverse effects and maximizing efficacy.  Despite considerable progress, challenges remain, including the complexity of interpreting genomic data, the presence of intratumoral heterogeneity, and the development of resistance mechanisms. Ongoing research focuses on integrating multi-omics data, developing more sophisticated predictive models, and exploring novel therapeutic targets to improve the precision and efficacy of personalized cancer therapies.
