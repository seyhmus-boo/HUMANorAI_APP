Climate change, driven primarily by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  While the Earth's climate has naturally fluctuated throughout history, the current rate of warming is unprecedented, exceeding the variability observed over millennia.  Early recognition of climate's impact on health, albeit limited in scope, emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with observations linking weather patterns to disease outbreaks like cholera. However, it was not until the latter half of the 20th century, with growing scientific understanding of the greenhouse effect and escalating environmental concerns, that the relationship between climate change and public health became a distinct field of study.  This research area has since expanded exponentially, revealing a complex interplay between climate-related hazards and human health outcomes. This paper explores this crucial relationship, examining the diverse pathways through which climate change impacts human health, including direct effects like heatstroke and extreme weather events, as well as indirect effects such as altered disease vectors, food insecurity, and mental health consequences.  Further, we will discuss the disparities in vulnerability across different populations and explore potential mitigation and adaptation strategies to protect public health in a changing climate.
