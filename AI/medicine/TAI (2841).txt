Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgery, offering patients reduced trauma, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times.  This presentation will trace the evolution of MIS, highlighting key technological advancements and their impact on surgical practice. We will explore the transition from early laparoscopic approaches, characterized by limited instrumentation and visualization, to the sophisticated robotic and image-guided techniques prevalent today.  Significant milestones such as the development of improved optics, energy sources (e.g., lasers, ultrasonic shears), and specialized instruments will be discussed, alongside their influence on expanding the range of surgical procedures amenable to MIS. Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the concurrent evolution of surgical training and simulation, crucial for mastering the dexterity and precision required for these complex procedures.  Finally, we will address future directions in MIS, including the potential of artificial intelligence, augmented reality, and single-port access techniques to further refine surgical precision, minimize invasiveness, and personalize patient care. This overview aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the ongoing development and future prospects of MIS surgery.
