Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting evolving trends and treatment challenges. Historically, adolescent mental health received limited attention, often conflated with "teenage angst" and lacking dedicated research.  However, rising awareness and improved diagnostic tools have revealed increasing prevalence rates of conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, particularly among females.  These trends are likely influenced by societal factors including increased academic pressure, social media use, and exposure to trauma.  Early interventions are crucial, yet access to appropriate mental healthcare remains a barrier for many adolescents, compounded by stigma and resource limitations. While pharmacological interventions, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and stimulants, have proven effective for certain disorders, evidence supports the efficacy of various psychosocial therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).  Future research should focus on identifying modifiable risk factors, improving early detection strategies, and optimizing integrated models of care that address the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors influencing adolescent mental well-being.  A comprehensive, multi-faceted approach encompassing prevention, early intervention, and evidence-based treatments is essential to mitigate the growing burden of adolescent mental health disorders.
