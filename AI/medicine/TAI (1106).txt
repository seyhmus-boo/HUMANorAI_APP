While not directly governed by quantum mechanical phenomena at the macroscopic level, understanding cancer's genetic basis profoundly benefits from quantum chemical computations.  Advances in personalized medicine hinge on precisely characterizing the mutations driving tumorigenesis, a task greatly aided by *in silico* techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) and other quantum chemical methods provide accurate predictions of molecular geometries, electronic structures, and reaction pathways crucial for understanding protein function affected by mutations.  For instance, DFT can model the altered binding affinities of mutated proteins to drugs or other molecules, facilitating the design of targeted therapies.  Furthermore, quantum mechanics illuminates the intricacies of DNA repair mechanisms, where the subtle electronic interactions influencing enzyme-substrate binding are vital to understanding repair deficiency leading to cancerous mutations.  High-throughput sequencing, coupled with computational analysis leveraging quantum chemical insights, allows for the identification of unique genetic signatures in individual cancers, informing the selection of personalized treatment strategies.  However, scaling these computations to the complexity of the entire genome remains a challenge, highlighting the ongoing need for algorithm development and computational power to fully exploit the quantum mechanical foundation of personalized cancer treatment.
