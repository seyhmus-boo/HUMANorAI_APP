Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This paper examines the complex and evolving relationship between climate change and a range of health outcomes, moving beyond a focus on singular impacts to explore the interconnectedness of various climate-related stressors and their synergistic effects.  We review existing literature to elucidate the pathways through which climate change impacts human health, encompassing both direct effects, such as heat-related morbidity and mortality and the spread of infectious diseases, and indirect effects, including mental health consequences of extreme weather events, displacement, and food insecurity.  Furthermore, we analyze the disproportionate burden of climate change-related health risks on vulnerable populations, highlighting existing health inequalities exacerbated by climate change. The paper concludes by discussing the urgent need for integrated, multi-sectoral approaches to mitigation and adaptation, emphasizing the crucial role of public health interventions in strengthening resilience and minimizing the adverse health impacts of a changing climate.  This research contributes to a growing body of knowledge emphasizing the imperative for proactive and comprehensive strategies to protect global public health in the face of escalating climate change impacts.
