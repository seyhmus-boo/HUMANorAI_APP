Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant threat to global health security, jeopardizing the effective treatment of bacterial infections.  The widespread use and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture have driven the selection and proliferation of resistant bacteria.  This abstract highlights the global implications of AR, encompassing increased morbidity and mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, escalating healthcare costs, and diminished effectiveness of surgical procedures.  The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens further exacerbates this challenge, limiting treatment options and leading to increased treatment failures.  The global dissemination of resistant bacteria, facilitated by international travel and trade, contributes to the rapid spread of AR genes, demanding a coordinated international response.  Addressing this crisis requires a multifaceted approach including optimizing antibiotic stewardship programs, developing novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapies, strengthening surveillance systems, and promoting infection prevention and control measures.  Ultimately, a One Health approach that considers the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health is crucial to mitigate the devastating impact of AR on a global scale.
