Antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria to withstand the effects of antibiotics, poses a significant global threat with profound implications for human and animal health.  The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics has driven the selection and proliferation of resistant strains, rendering previously effective treatments ineffective.  This phenomenon is exacerbated by the slow pace of antibiotic discovery and development, creating a critical imbalance between the emergence of resistance and the availability of new therapeutic options.

The global implications are multifaceted. Increased morbidity and mortality rates due to untreatable infections are projected, placing substantial strain on healthcare systems.  The economic burden includes escalating healthcare costs, lost productivity, and the potential for reduced agricultural yields due to resistant pathogens affecting livestock.  Furthermore, resistance can complicate surgical procedures, organ transplantation, and cancer treatment, where antibiotics are crucial for infection prevention.

Practical applications focusing on combating resistance include stringent antibiotic stewardship programs, promoting responsible antibiotic use in human and veterinary medicine, and investing in research and development of novel antibiotics and alternative therapies, such as bacteriophages and antimicrobial peptides.  Improved sanitation and hygiene practices, alongside enhanced surveillance and monitoring of resistance patterns, are crucial for mitigating the global challenge posed by this evolving threat.
