Ethical considerations in organ transplantation have evolved alongside technological advancements, presenting ongoing challenges for healthcare systems and bioethics.  Historically, procurement practices were often shrouded in ambiguity, with concerns regarding informed consent and equitable access emerging prominently.  Early practices, lacking robust ethical frameworks, led to exploitative situations and disproportionate organ allocation.  This presentation will explore the historical trajectory of these ethical dilemmas, highlighting the shift from implicit consent models to the current emphasis on explicit consent and donor autonomy.  We will examine key ethical principles such as beneficence, non-maleficence, justice, and autonomy in the context of organ allocation, focusing on the challenges of equitable distribution amidst scarcity.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss emerging ethical concerns surrounding novel technologies like 3D-printed organs and xenotransplantation, underscoring the need for proactive and transparent ethical frameworks to guide future practices.  Finally, we will briefly address the socio-economic factors influencing organ donation and transplantation, arguing for a holistic approach that considers both individual rights and societal needs.
