Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat to public health, jeopardizing the effective treatment of bacterial infections.  This presentation will explore the multifaceted nature of AR, examining its drivers including overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, and the dissemination of resistant genes across diverse microbial populations.  The global implications are profound, encompassing increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and substantial economic burdens on healthcare systems worldwide.  We will discuss the alarming rise in infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, highlighting the urgent need for concerted global action.  Practical applications of current strategies to combat AR will be presented, focusing on responsible antibiotic stewardship programs, the development and implementation of rapid diagnostic tests to guide targeted therapy,  the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches such as phage therapy and antimicrobial peptides, and the promotion of hygiene and sanitation initiatives.  Finally, we will emphasize the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and policy changes to mitigate the looming crisis of antibiotic resistance and secure a future where effective antibacterial treatments remain available.
