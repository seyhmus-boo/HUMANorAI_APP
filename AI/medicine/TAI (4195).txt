Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting crucial cellular processes like growth regulation and apoptosis.  Understanding the specific genetic alterations driving individual cancers is paramount for effective treatment.  Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS), a cornerstone of genomics, have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling of tumour samples, revealing the unique mutational landscape of each cancer. This interdisciplinary field integrates oncology, bioinformatics, and molecular biology. Bioinformatics tools analyze NGS data, identifying driver mutations, gene fusions, and copy number variations. This information informs personalized medicine, enabling targeted therapies tailored to the specific genetic aberrations within a patient's tumour.  Pharmacogenomics, bridging pharmacology and genetics, further refines treatment selection by predicting drug response based on individual genetic makeup.  Furthermore, immunogenomics, combining immunology and genomics, leverages genomic data to predict the efficacy of immunotherapy by analyzing the tumour's mutational load and neoantigen profile.  These interdisciplinary advances offer a path towards more precise, effective, and less toxic cancer treatments.
