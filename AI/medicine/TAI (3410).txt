Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, yet rigorously establishing causal relationships remains experimentally challenging.  This presentation explores the key methodological hurdles in investigating this complex interplay.  Firstly, the inherent difficulty in isolating the effect of climate change from other confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status and existing health inequalities, presents a major obstacle.  Secondly, the long latency periods between climate-related exposures (e.g., increased heatwaves) and subsequent health outcomes complicate the design and interpretation of epidemiological studies.  Thirdly, the spatial and temporal heterogeneity of climate change impacts necessitates sophisticated statistical modelling and geographically diverse datasets, which may be limited in availability or quality.  Finally, ethical considerations surrounding human subject research, particularly in vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by climate change, present significant challenges. This presentation will discuss innovative experimental designs and analytical approaches, such as quasi-experimental methods, advanced spatial statistics, and the integration of diverse data sources, that can help overcome these challenges and strengthen the evidence base for informing effective climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies aimed at improving public health.
