The relationship between climate change and public health is profoundly complex, demanding an inherently interdisciplinary approach.  Climate change acts as a threat multiplier, exacerbating existing health inequalities and generating novel challenges.  This necessitates collaboration between climatologists, epidemiologists, public health professionals, and social scientists.

Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly impacting vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns influence the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, requiring expertise in entomology and infectious disease modelling.  Furthermore, extreme weather events, increasingly frequent and intense due to climate change, lead to injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences, demanding input from disaster management specialists and psychologists.  Finally, the socio-economic impacts of climate change – resource scarcity and displacement – further strain healthcare systems and exacerbate existing health disparities, highlighting the crucial role of social and economic research.  Addressing this multifaceted challenge necessitates a holistic, interdisciplinary strategy.
