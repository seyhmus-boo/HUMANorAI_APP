Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This paper examines the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving its advancements. From the early laparoscopic procedures of the late 20th century to the sophisticated robotic and image-guided techniques of today, the field has witnessed exponential growth. This progress has not been solely the product of surgical ingenuity, but rather a synergistic outcome of interactions between surgeons, engineers, computer scientists, material scientists, and medical imaging specialists.  This research explores the key technological innovations that have shaped MIS, including the development of advanced imaging modalities, robotic platforms, and novel instrumentation. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of these interdisciplinary partnerships on patient outcomes, such as reduced pain, shorter hospital stays, and improved aesthetic results.  Finally, we discuss emerging trends and future directions, considering the potential of artificial intelligence and augmented reality to further refine and personalize minimally invasive surgical approaches.
