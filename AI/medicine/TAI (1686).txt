Cancer is a complex disease with a heterogeneous genetic basis.  Advances in genomic technologies have revolutionized our understanding of oncogenesis, revealing a vast landscape of driver mutations, genomic instability, and epigenetic alterations that contribute to tumor development and progression. This presentation will explore recent breakthroughs in our comprehension of the genetic underpinnings of various cancer types, focusing on the identification of key cancer-associated genes and pathways. We will discuss how this knowledge translates into the burgeoning field of personalized medicine.

The ability to profile a patient's tumor genome allows for the precise identification of targetable mutations, facilitating the selection of optimal therapies tailored to individual genetic profiles.  This shift from traditional, one-size-fits-all approaches towards precision oncology has significantly improved treatment outcomes in several cancer types. Examples of practical applications will be highlighted, including the use of targeted therapies against specific oncogenic mutations (e.g., EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer), immunotherapy based on tumor mutational burden, and the development of novel diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers.  Furthermore, the challenges and limitations associated with the implementation of personalized cancer medicine, such as cost-effectiveness and access, will be briefly discussed.  This presentation aims to provide an overview of the exciting advancements in cancer genetics and their transformative impact on patient care.
