This presentation explores the multifaceted role of vaccination in preventing infectious diseases, highlighting crucial interdisciplinary links crucial to its success.  While primarily a medical intervention, vaccination's effectiveness hinges on robust contributions from diverse fields.  We will examine the epidemiological basis for vaccination strategies, emphasizing the importance of surveillance data and modelling to predict disease outbreaks and target high-risk populations.  The ethical considerations surrounding mandatory vaccination programs, encompassing legal frameworks and public health communication strategies, will be discussed.  Furthermore, the economic impact of vaccination, including cost-effectiveness analyses and the societal burden of preventable diseases, will be analyzed. Finally, the presentation will address the crucial role of social sciences in understanding vaccine hesitancy and developing targeted interventions to improve vaccine uptake, acknowledging the complex interplay of individual beliefs, social norms, and misinformation.  By integrating perspectives from epidemiology, ethics, economics, and social sciences, we aim to illustrate the holistic nature of successful vaccination programs and advocate for a multidisciplinary approach to future infectious disease control.
