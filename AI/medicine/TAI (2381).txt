Telemedicine has rapidly evolved from a niche application to a cornerstone of modern healthcare delivery, significantly impacted by recent technological advancements and the exigencies of the COVID-19 pandemic. This presentation will explore the expanding role of telemedicine in addressing healthcare access disparities and improving efficiency. We will examine recent developments in remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies, including wearable sensors and AI-driven diagnostic tools, which facilitate proactive care and early intervention.  The integration of telehealth platforms with electronic health records (EHRs) is also crucial, enhancing data sharing and continuity of care.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the evolving legal and ethical frameworks governing telemedicine practice, addressing issues such as data privacy, licensing requirements, and reimbursement models.  Finally, we will analyze the ongoing challenges and future directions of telemedicine, including the need for robust broadband infrastructure, equitable access for vulnerable populations, and the development of standardized protocols to ensure quality and safety across diverse settings.  The discussion aims to highlight the transformative potential of telemedicine while acknowledging the persistent hurdles requiring further investigation and collaborative effort.
