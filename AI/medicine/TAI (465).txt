Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice over the past few decades. This paper explores the significant evolution of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, tracing its progression from rudimentary approaches to the sophisticated technologies employed today.  Early developments, such as laparoscopy, initially offered limited dexterity and visualization compared to open surgery.  However, continuous advancements in instrumentation, imaging modalities, and surgical platforms have dramatically expanded the capabilities of MIS.  This evolution encompasses improvements in camera technology, the development of refined robotic systems offering enhanced precision and control, and the incorporation of advanced energy sources for tissue dissection and hemostasis.  These technological leaps have broadened the spectrum of surgical procedures amenable to MIS, encompassing a wide range of specialties including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, urological, and gynecological surgery.  Practical applications have led to demonstrable benefits for patients, including reduced pain, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This research will analyze the key milestones in this technological progression, assess their impact on surgical practice, and discuss future directions in the ongoing evolution of MIS techniques.
