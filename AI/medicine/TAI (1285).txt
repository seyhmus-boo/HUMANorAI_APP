Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant threat to global health, demanding innovative solutions beyond traditional approaches.  This presentation explores the potential of quantum mechanical (QM) methods to address this crisis, moving beyond purely empirical drug discovery.  We argue that QM simulations offer a powerful tool for understanding the intricate molecular mechanisms underpinning AR, particularly focusing on the interactions between antibiotics and resistant bacterial enzymes.  Specifically, we will highlight how *ab initio* calculations and density functional theory (DFT) can elucidate the subtle energetic and structural changes associated with mutations conferring resistance, enabling the design of novel antibiotics with enhanced binding affinities and reduced susceptibility to resistance mechanisms.  Furthermore, we will discuss the application of QM/MM approaches in modelling the complex protein-drug interactions within the bacterial environment.  By leveraging the predictive power of QM simulations, we can accelerate the discovery and development of new antibiotics, potentially mitigating the growing global impact of AR and contributing towards a future with effective antimicrobial therapies.  We will conclude by outlining future directions for QM-based research in this crucial field, including the promising role of quantum computing in tackling the complexity of AR.
