Organ transplantation offers a life-saving intervention, yet its inherent complexities raise significant ethical dilemmas.  This presentation examines key ethical considerations surrounding organ transplantation, focusing on the tension between the urgent need for organs and the ethical principles guiding their allocation. We will explore the challenges posed by donor consent, including issues of presumed consent versus explicit consent, and the ethical implications for families facing difficult decisions during a time of grief.  Furthermore, we will analyze the complexities of organ allocation systems, addressing concerns about fairness, equity, and potential biases based on socioeconomic status, race, or other factors.  The presentation will also discuss the ethical obligations of healthcare professionals involved in the process, highlighting the importance of transparency, informed consent, and patient autonomy.  Practical applications will be considered, including the role of ethical review boards in overseeing transplant programs and the development of robust and transparent allocation policies to ensure equitable access to life-saving interventions.  Finally, we will briefly examine the evolving ethical landscape surrounding xenotransplantation and its unique challenges.
