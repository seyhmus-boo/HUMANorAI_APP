Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding ongoing critical analysis. This presentation will explore key ethical dilemmas inherent in the process, focusing on three core areas. Firstly, it will examine the allocation of scarce organs, addressing the tension between utilitarian principles aiming for maximum benefit and egalitarian principles ensuring fair access.  The challenges posed by differing criteria (e.g., medical urgency, waiting time, quality of life) and the potential for systemic biases will be discussed. Secondly, the ethical implications of living donation will be explored, including the assessment of donor autonomy and the potential for coercion, particularly within vulnerable populations.  The role of informed consent and the need for rigorous safeguards will be highlighted. Finally, the presentation will address the ethical dimensions of organ procurement and the crucial balance between respecting the deceased's autonomy (via advance directives) and maximizing the potential for transplantation. This necessitates a critical examination of existing legislation and best practices in ensuring transparency and minimizing potential conflicts of interest.  The presentation aims to stimulate discussion on refining current ethical frameworks to navigate these challenges and promote equitable and just organ allocation systems.
