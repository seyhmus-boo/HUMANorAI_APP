Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in the evolution of MIS, focusing on three key areas. Firstly, the development of novel instrumentation necessitates rigorous biomechanical testing to ensure optimal dexterity, precision, and safety within confined anatomical spaces.  Secondly,  improving visualization remains a crucial hurdle.  Experimental work examining enhanced imaging modalities, such as augmented reality and improved optical systems, is essential to overcome limitations of traditional laparoscopy. Finally, the translation of robotic and AI-assisted techniques from bench to bedside requires robust preclinical validation.  This includes evaluating the efficacy and safety of robotic platforms in complex surgical scenarios using both in vitro and in vivo models.  We will discuss the specific experimental methodologies employed in addressing these challenges, highlighting the critical need for standardized protocols and robust data analysis to facilitate the continued improvement and wider adoption of advanced MIS technologies.  The ultimate goal is to enhance surgical precision, minimize complications, and personalize surgical approaches for optimal patient outcomes.
