Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of antibiotics, poses a significant and escalating global threat.  The widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, as well as agriculture, has driven the selection and proliferation of resistant strains. This phenomenon transcends geographical boundaries, facilitated by international travel and trade, leading to the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens.  The global implications are profound, jeopardizing the effectiveness of treatments for bacterial infections, impacting healthcare systems through increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  AR necessitates longer hospital stays, more intensive care, and the use of more toxic alternative therapies, disproportionately affecting low-resource settings.  The resulting increase in treatment failures and mortality rates threatens to reverse progress in global health, impacting numerous Sustainable Development Goals.  Addressing AR demands a multi-pronged approach including responsible antibiotic stewardship, accelerated development of novel antimicrobials, improved sanitation and hygiene practices, and global collaboration in surveillance and research.  Failure to act decisively will have catastrophic consequences for global health security.
