This presentation examines emerging trends in adolescent mental health disorders and explores the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in effective treatment.  Recent data indicates a concerning rise in anxiety, depression, and self-harm amongst young people, highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive and integrated care models.  We will discuss the limitations of siloed approaches, emphasizing the necessity of integrating psychological, psychiatric, social work, and educational perspectives.  Specific examples will illustrate the benefits of collaborative interventions, such as coordinated care pathways for eating disorders involving dieticians, therapists, and physicians, or the integration of mental health support within school settings involving teachers, counselors, and peer support networks. Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the impact of societal factors, like social media usage and academic pressure, on adolescent mental wellbeing and how interdisciplinary research can inform preventative strategies.  Finally, we will highlight the need for further research into the effectiveness of interdisciplinary models and advocate for the development of training programs promoting collaborative practice in adolescent mental health.
