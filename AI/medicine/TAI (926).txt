Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice over recent decades.  This paper explores the evolutionary trajectory of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving this progress.  Early MIS techniques, primarily laparoscopy, relied heavily on advancements in optics and instrumentation. However, the field's subsequent expansion into robotics, image-guided surgery, and enhanced recovery programs demonstrates a complex interplay between surgical expertise, engineering innovation, and advancements in medical imaging, anesthesia, and rehabilitation.  This interdisciplinary approach has been essential in overcoming limitations inherent in early MIS techniques, such as dexterity constraints and the restricted field of view. We analyze the synergistic effects of collaborations between surgeons, engineers, computer scientists, anesthesiologists, and physiotherapists, focusing on key technological breakthroughs and their implications for patient outcomes.  Furthermore, this study examines the evolving challenges and future directions for MIS, considering emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and the potential for further integration across disciplines to refine surgical precision and enhance patient safety.
