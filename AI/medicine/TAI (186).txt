Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window of vulnerability for the onset of mental health disorders.  This paper examines emerging trends in adolescent mental health, focusing on the escalating prevalence of conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  While traditional approaches to treatment, often siloed within psychiatry or psychology, have shown limited efficacy in addressing the complex interplay of factors contributing to these disorders, an interdisciplinary approach is crucial.  This necessitates collaboration across medicine, psychology, social work, neuroscience, and education.  We will explore the benefits of integrating biological, psychological, and socio-environmental perspectives in understanding the etiology and developing effective interventions.  This integrated framework will consider the impact of factors such as genetic predispositions, family dynamics, peer influences, societal pressures, and access to resources. Ultimately, this paper argues for a paradigm shift towards holistic, interdisciplinary models of care that acknowledge the multifaceted nature of adolescent mental health challenges and strive for improved outcomes through collaborative research and practice.
