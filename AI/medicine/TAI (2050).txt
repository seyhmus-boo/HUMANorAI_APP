Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health. This presentation explores the complex interplay between environmental shifts and human well-being, examining both direct and indirect health impacts.  Direct effects include increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, exacerbated by extreme weather events such as floods and droughts that displace populations and disrupt healthcare infrastructure.  Indirect impacts are equally crucial, encompassing the proliferation of vector-borne diseases, alterations in air and water quality, and the exacerbation of food insecurity and malnutrition.  These factors disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and low-income communities. The presentation will review existing literature highlighting the evidence base for these connections, focusing on emerging research on mental health impacts associated with climate-related disasters and displacement.  Furthermore, it will discuss the challenges of mitigating these risks and the importance of incorporating climate change considerations into public health policy and practice, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaborations and community-based approaches for effective adaptation and resilience building.  Finally, the presentation will briefly outline promising strategies for strengthening healthcare systems in the face of escalating climate-related health threats.
