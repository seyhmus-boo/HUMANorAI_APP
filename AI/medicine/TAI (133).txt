Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, demanding urgent research and intervention.  A critical challenge lies in the experimental complexities of studying its emergence and spread.  Traditional *in vitro* studies, while useful for initial screening, often fail to capture the intricate interplay of bacterial populations within complex host environments.  The high mutation rates of bacteria, coupled with horizontal gene transfer mechanisms, render predicting resistance evolution challenging, particularly in the context of polymicrobial infections.  Furthermore,  *in vivo* models, while more representative, struggle with scalability and ethical considerations, especially when employing mammalian models.  Developing robust *in silico* models, incorporating factors like bacterial genetics, host immunity, and antibiotic pharmacokinetics, represents a significant methodological hurdle.  Accurate quantification of resistance prevalence through standardized surveillance methods also remains a challenge, especially in resource-limited settings, hindering effective global monitoring and response strategies.  Overcoming these experimental limitations requires interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of innovative high-throughput screening techniques and predictive modelling approaches to address this escalating global crisis.
