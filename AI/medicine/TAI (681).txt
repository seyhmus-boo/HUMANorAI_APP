Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This presentation traces the evolution of MIS techniques, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving innovation.  Early laparoscopic approaches, initially limited by technical challenges and restricted visualization, have evolved dramatically.  Advancements in optics, instrumentation, and energy sources, facilitated by engineering and materials science collaborations, have broadened the scope of MIS to increasingly complex procedures.  Furthermore, the integration of imaging modalities, such as intraoperative ultrasound and fluorescence imaging (driven by collaborations with radiology and biomedical engineering), has enhanced precision and safety.  The rise of robotic surgery, leveraging contributions from robotics and computer science, represents a significant leap forward, enabling enhanced dexterity and precision in intricate procedures.  This presentation will discuss the synergistic relationships between surgery, engineering, imaging sciences, and computer science, demonstrating how these interdisciplinary links have been central to the remarkable progress in MIS techniques and the continuous improvement of patient care.  Finally, the presentation will briefly consider future directions, including the potential of augmented and virtual reality in refining surgical training and enhancing surgical precision.
