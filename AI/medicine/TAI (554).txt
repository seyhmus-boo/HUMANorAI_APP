Adolescence, a period of significant physical, cognitive, and emotional development, is also a critical window for the onset of mental health disorders.  This paper examines emerging trends in the prevalence and presentation of these disorders among adolescents, highlighting the increasing burden on healthcare systems globally.  While traditional approaches to treatment often focus on individual disciplines, such as psychiatry or psychology,  a comprehensive understanding and effective management require a demonstrably interdisciplinary approach.  This research explores the crucial interconnectedness of biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to adolescent mental health challenges. We will investigate the evolving landscape of treatments, including pharmacological interventions, psychotherapies, and community-based initiatives, emphasizing the synergistic potential of integrating these approaches. Specifically, we will analyze the contributions of various disciplines, such as neuroscience, sociology, education, and social work, to both diagnosis and treatment strategies.  This interdisciplinary lens aims to reveal gaps in current practices and suggest avenues for future research to improve the efficacy and accessibility of mental healthcare for adolescents facing increasing mental health pressures.
