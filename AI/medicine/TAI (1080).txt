Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice.  However, the underlying physics governing the interaction of surgical instruments with biological tissues at the microscale remains largely unexplored through a quantum mechanical lens.  This paper argues that a deeper understanding of these interactions, particularly those involving energy transfer and molecular-level changes during tissue dissection and coagulation, can significantly advance MIS techniques.  While classical mechanics adequately describes macroscopic surgical instrument manipulation, the precise mechanisms of energy deposition at the cellular and molecular level – processes crucial to effective and safe MIS – require a quantum mechanical framework. This study explores the potential applications of quantum mechanics in understanding and improving key aspects of MIS, such as laser ablation, ultrasonic scalpel operation, and the interaction of nanoparticulate drug delivery systems with target tissues.  By examining these processes through the lens of quantum theory, we aim to highlight opportunities for developing novel surgical instruments, improving precision, minimizing collateral damage, and ultimately, enhancing patient outcomes in minimally invasive procedures. We will investigate the potential for quantum effects, such as quantum tunneling and entanglement, to contribute to the refinement of surgical techniques at a fundamental level.
