Organ transplantation, while a life-saving medical intervention, presents complex ethical dilemmas.  The scarcity of viable organs necessitates allocation systems prioritizing recipients, often based on medical urgency, likelihood of success, and waiting time.  This raises concerns about fairness and justice, particularly regarding disparities in access based on socioeconomic status and geographic location.  The inherent power imbalance between medical professionals and patients requires meticulous informed consent procedures, addressing potential coercion and ensuring patient autonomy in decision-making, even in life-threatening situations.

Ethical considerations also extend to organ procurement.  While deceased donation relies on altruism and robust consent frameworks,  living donation introduces complexities regarding donor autonomy, potential for coercion, and the assessment of risks versus benefits.  Furthermore, the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation introduces novel ethical challenges concerning animal welfare, potential zoonotic disease transmission, and the moral status of non-human animals.  Addressing these challenges necessitates transparent allocation policies, robust ethical review boards, and ongoing public dialogue to balance the immense therapeutic potential of transplantation with the moral imperatives of fairness, respect for persons, and responsible innovation.
