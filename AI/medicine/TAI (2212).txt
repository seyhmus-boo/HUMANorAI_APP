Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  The rise of resistant pathogens necessitates collaboration across microbiology, epidemiology, medicine, veterinary science, agriculture, and social sciences.  Overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, drive the selection and spread of resistant strains.  Epidemiological studies reveal complex transmission dynamics, highlighting the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental reservoirs.  One Health initiatives emphasize the need for integrated surveillance and control strategies, encompassing responsible antibiotic stewardship in healthcare settings and agriculture, alongside improvements in sanitation and hygiene infrastructure.  Furthermore, social sciences are crucial in addressing the complex interplay of socio-economic factors influencing antibiotic use and resistance dissemination, including patient compliance, healthcare access, and public awareness campaigns.  Developing novel antibiotics and alternative therapeutic strategies, coupled with robust global collaborations and policy interventions, are urgently needed to tackle this escalating public health crisis and safeguard global health security.
