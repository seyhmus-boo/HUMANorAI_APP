The adolescent period, a critical juncture of physical and psychological development, is increasingly recognized as a period of heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders.  This paper investigates the evolving trends in adolescent mental health, focusing on the prevalence and manifestation of key disorders such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.  A significant rise in diagnoses over recent decades necessitates a comprehensive examination of contributing factors, encompassing biological, psychological, and socio-environmental influences.  However, the complex etiology of these disorders demands an interdisciplinary approach to both understanding and treating them.

This research explores the interconnectedness of various disciplines in addressing adolescent mental health challenges. We will analyze the contributions of psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience, sociology, and public health, highlighting how their unique perspectives converge to inform effective intervention strategies.  The paper further examines the efficacy of existing treatments, considering the limitations of traditional approaches and the promising potential of emerging therapies such as mindfulness-based interventions and digital mental health tools. By emphasizing the crucial interdisciplinary links, this study aims to contribute to a more holistic and effective framework for the prevention and management of mental health disorders in adolescents.
