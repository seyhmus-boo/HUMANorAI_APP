The genetic basis of cancer is increasingly understood, driving advancements in personalized medicine.  Cancer is not a single disease, but a collection of diverse diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation arising from somatic mutations affecting genes regulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.  Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, identifying driver mutations specific to individual patients. This knowledge underpins the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for specific oncogenic mutations in lung or colorectal cancers, and immune checkpoint inhibitors that leverage the patient's own immune system to target tumor cells expressing specific neoantigens.  Furthermore, pharmacogenomics utilizes genetic information to predict drug response and toxicity, optimizing treatment selection and minimizing adverse effects.  Practical applications include the stratification of patients into clinically relevant subgroups for targeted therapy trials, the development of companion diagnostics to identify patients likely to benefit from specific treatments, and the prediction of recurrence risk based on mutational profiles.  However, challenges remain, including the complexity of cancer genomes, the emergence of drug resistance, and the need for cost-effective and accessible genomic testing for widespread implementation.
