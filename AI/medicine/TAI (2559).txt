This presentation examines current trends and effective treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents.  We will explore the rising prevalence of conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, highlighting contributing factors such as social media pressures, academic stress, and societal changes.  The presentation will analyze epidemiological data demonstrating the shifting landscape of adolescent mental health, focusing on potential disparities based on socioeconomic status, gender, and ethnicity.  Furthermore, we will review evidence-based therapeutic approaches, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacological interventions.  The efficacy and limitations of each treatment modality will be discussed, considering the unique developmental needs of adolescents.  Finally, we will address the critical importance of early intervention, emphasizing the role of integrated care models, school-based mental health services, and family involvement in improving outcomes and reducing long-term morbidity.  The presentation aims to provide clinicians, educators, and researchers with an updated understanding of this pressing public health issue and to stimulate discussion regarding the development and implementation of comprehensive, adolescent-focused mental health initiatives.
