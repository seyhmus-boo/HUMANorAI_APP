Climate change poses a significant and increasingly urgent threat to global public health.  Beyond the well-established impacts of extreme weather events on mortality and injury, recent research highlights a complex and nuanced relationship extending far beyond immediate catastrophes. This paper examines the multifaceted ways in which a changing climate affects human health, considering both direct and indirect consequences.  Recent developments underscore the growing urgency: attribution science increasingly pinpoints the role of climate change in exacerbating specific heatwaves, wildfires, and flooding events, leading to quantifiable increases in morbidity and mortality. Furthermore, the expansion of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, driven by shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns, represents a major emerging health challenge.  Beyond these direct impacts, climate change indirectly influences public health through food insecurity, water scarcity, displacement, and mental health issues stemming from climate-related trauma and anxiety. This study synthesizes existing literature to analyze these diverse pathways, focusing on recent advancements in understanding climate change's health impacts and exploring the implications for future public health planning and policy interventions.
