Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical robotics.  This presentation will trace the key developments shaping contemporary MIS techniques, focusing on recent breakthroughs.  Early laparoscopic approaches, hampered by limited dexterity and visualization, have been significantly enhanced by the advent of high-definition 3D cameras and flexible endoscopes, providing surgeons with improved spatial perception.  Simultaneously, advancements in robotic surgery, exemplified by da Vinci systems and emerging flexible robotic platforms, offer enhanced precision, articulation, and tremor filtration, resulting in reduced trauma and improved surgical outcomes.  Furthermore, the integration of augmented reality and artificial intelligence is revolutionizing surgical planning and intraoperative guidance, facilitating more precise incisions and reducing surgical time.  We will discuss the implications of these technological advancements on various surgical specialties, including cardiac, urological, and gastrointestinal surgery.  Finally, we will explore emerging trends, such as single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), highlighting the ongoing pursuit of minimally invasive surgical techniques that minimize patient morbidity and accelerate recovery.
