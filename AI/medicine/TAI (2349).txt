Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat to public health.  The widespread use and misuse of antibiotics have driven the selection and proliferation of resistant bacterial strains, compromising the efficacy of life-saving treatments for a range of infectious diseases. This phenomenon transcends geographical boundaries, facilitated by the global movement of people, animals, and goods. The consequences extend beyond increased morbidity and mortality from infections; AR impacts healthcare systems through prolonged hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and the need for more expensive and potentially toxic alternative therapies.  Economic implications are substantial, with projected losses impacting national economies and hindering development.  The emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), particularly in healthcare settings, represents a particularly severe challenge.  Combating AR necessitates a multi-pronged approach involving improved infection control practices, responsible antibiotic stewardship programs, accelerated development of novel antimicrobials, and the implementation of global surveillance and collaborative research initiatives.  Failure to address this global crisis will have profound and irreversible consequences on human health and global stability.
