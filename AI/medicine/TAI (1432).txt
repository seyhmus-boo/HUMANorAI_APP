The evolution of minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIST) has been significantly shaped by ongoing experimental challenges. Early laparoscopic procedures, while offering reduced trauma, faced limitations in dexterity and visualization compared to open surgery.  Experiments focusing on instrument design aimed to overcome these limitations, leading to the development of articulated instruments and improved endoscopic cameras offering enhanced three-dimensional visualization.  However, the confined working space within the abdominal cavity presented significant challenges, necessitating the development of specialized surgical tools and techniques.  Robotic surgery emerged as a response, offering greater precision and dexterity, but introduced new complexities, including the need for extensive training, the high cost of systems, and the challenges of haptic feedback.  Experimental work on haptic technology continues to strive for improved tactile sensation in robotic surgery to enhance surgeon control and reduce errors.  Furthermore, the translation of novel surgical techniques and technologies from pre-clinical benchtop models to clinical practice remains a significant challenge.  Rigorous testing of materials, instruments, and robotic systems is essential to ensure safety and efficacy before widespread adoption, highlighting the crucial role of experimental research in driving the continued advancement of MIST.
