Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, jeopardizing progress in modern medicine and public health.  This presentation will explore the multifaceted implications of AR, focusing on recent developments in its epidemiology and mitigation strategies.  We will examine the alarming rise of resistance to last-resort antibiotics, such as carbapenems and colistin, highlighting the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens across diverse healthcare settings and communities.  Recent genomic surveillance efforts, revealing the complex spread of resistance genes via horizontal gene transfer and the identification of novel resistance mechanisms, will be discussed.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the limitations of current infection control practices and the urgent need for innovative approaches.  We will review recent advances in therapeutic strategies, including the development of novel antibiotics, phage therapy, and immune-based therapies.  Finally, the presentation will emphasize the crucial role of global collaboration, responsible antibiotic stewardship, and public health interventions in curbing the escalating crisis of AR and safeguarding future healthcare capabilities.
