Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding ongoing scrutiny. This presentation explores key ethical dilemmas inherent in the process, focusing on three primary areas:  allocation of scarce resources, informed consent, and the potential for coercion or exploitation.  We will examine the challenges posed by various allocation systems, including utilitarian approaches prioritizing those with the greatest potential benefit and egalitarian models emphasizing equal access.  The presentation critically analyzes the complexities of obtaining truly informed consent from potential donors, particularly in cases involving living donation and vulnerable populations.  Further, the potential for financial incentives and undue influence on decision-making, especially within families facing emotional distress, will be discussed.  Finally, the presentation will address the ongoing debate surrounding organ tourism and the global inequities it exacerbates. By examining these multifaceted issues, we aim to highlight the need for robust ethical frameworks and transparent practices to ensure fairness, justice, and respect for individual autonomy within the organ transplantation system.
