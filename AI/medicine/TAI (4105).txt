Climate change, driven predominantly by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  While the impact of environmental factors on human well-being has been acknowledged for centuries, the scale and urgency of the current climate crisis necessitate a renewed and intensified focus on its health implications. Historically, epidemiological studies have linked specific weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, to increased morbidity and mortality.  However, understanding has evolved beyond the immediate consequences of extreme weather to encompass a wider spectrum of health risks.  These include the proliferation of vector-borne diseases due to shifting geographical ranges of pathogens, exacerbation of respiratory illnesses through worsened air quality, and the impact on mental health stemming from displacement, resource scarcity, and climate-related trauma.  This research paper explores the complex and dynamic interplay between climate change and public health, examining established and emerging linkages.  It will investigate the diverse pathways through which climate change impacts human health, considers geographical variations in vulnerability, and ultimately assesses the effectiveness of current and prospective mitigation and adaptation strategies.
