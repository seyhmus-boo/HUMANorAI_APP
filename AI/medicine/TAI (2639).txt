Antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria to withstand antimicrobial drugs, presents a grave and escalating global threat.  Its implications extend far beyond individual health, impacting healthcare systems, economies, and global security. The review of existing literature highlights a complex interplay of factors driving resistance, including overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, and the widespread dissemination of resistant genes via horizontal transfer.  The consequences are dire: increased morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases, prolonged hospital stays, and escalating healthcare costs.  

Practical applications to combat this crisis include promoting responsible antibiotic stewardship through improved diagnostics, enhanced infection prevention and control measures, and targeted antibiotic prescriptions.  Furthermore, accelerating the development and deployment of novel antimicrobials, such as phage therapy and novel antibiotic classes, is crucial.  Investment in research focusing on alternative therapeutic strategies, including vaccines and immunotherapies, is equally vital.  Addressing the issue necessitates a multi-faceted approach involving international collaboration, public health initiatives, and individual behavioural changes to mitigate the catastrophic potential of untreatable bacterial infections.
