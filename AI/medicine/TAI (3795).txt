Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, jeopardizing the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies across a wide range of bacterial infections.  The dissemination of resistance genes, facilitated by horizontal gene transfer mechanisms and the widespread use and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, agriculture, and aquaculture, contributes to the emergence and proliferation of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens. This phenomenon transcends geographical boundaries, impacting both high- and low-income countries disproportionately.  The consequences are far-reaching, including increased morbidity and mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, higher healthcare costs, and diminished effectiveness of surgical procedures.  The global burden of AR necessitates a multi-pronged, coordinated response encompassing strengthened surveillance systems to monitor resistance patterns, improved infection control practices to mitigate transmission, the development and deployment of novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapeutic strategies, and a concerted effort to optimize antibiotic stewardship programs to minimize unnecessary antibiotic use. Without a substantial global commitment to combat AR, the potential for untreatable infections and a return to the pre-antibiotic era presents a grave and imminent threat to public health security.
