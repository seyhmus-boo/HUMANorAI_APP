Adolescents experience a heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders, exhibiting increasing prevalence rates globally.  This abstract examines emerging trends in adolescent mental health, focusing on anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use disorders, which show significant upward trajectories linked to societal factors such as increased academic pressure, social media influence, and the COVID-19 pandemic.  Treatment approaches are evolving, shifting from primarily medication-focused strategies towards integrated models emphasizing evidence-based psychotherapies.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) demonstrate efficacy in managing anxiety and mood disorders, while motivational interviewing proves effective for substance use issues.  However, access to timely and appropriate care remains a significant challenge, exacerbated by disparities in socioeconomic status and geographical location. Future research should focus on preventative interventions targeting modifiable risk factors and improving access to culturally sensitive and comprehensive mental healthcare services tailored to the unique developmental needs of adolescents.
