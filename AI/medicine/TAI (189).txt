Antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria to withstand the effects of antibiotics, poses a significant global threat with profound implications for human health and economic stability.  Its historical roots trace back to the discovery of penicillin in the 1920s, triggering widespread antibiotic use that inadvertently selected for resistant strains.  Over-prescription, misuse in agriculture, and inadequate infection control practices have accelerated this process.  

The global implications are multifaceted.  Increased morbidity and mortality from previously treatable infections are projected, straining healthcare systems and increasing healthcare costs.  The resurgence of previously eradicated diseases, coupled with the emergence of antibiotic-resistant "superbugs," jeopardizes surgical procedures and cancer treatments reliant on antibiotic prophylaxis.  Furthermore, the economic burden extends beyond healthcare, affecting agricultural productivity and tourism through livestock and food safety concerns.  Addressing this crisis necessitates a multi-pronged approach including responsible antibiotic stewardship, investment in novel antibiotic development, and implementation of robust infection control measures across healthcare and agricultural sectors.
