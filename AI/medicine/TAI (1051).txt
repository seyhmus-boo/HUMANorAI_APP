Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents a significant challenge to effective treatment.  However, advancements in genomics are revolutionizing oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies now enable comprehensive profiling of tumour genomes, identifying driver mutations crucial for cancer initiation and progression.  This allows for the precise classification of cancers beyond traditional histological methods, moving beyond broad categories to a more nuanced understanding of individual tumorigenesis.

Recent developments include the identification of novel therapeutic targets based on genomic profiling.  For example, the discovery of specific gene fusions has led to the development of targeted therapies showing remarkable efficacy in certain cancers.  Furthermore, liquid biopsies, analysing circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), offer minimally invasive methods for monitoring disease progression, detecting minimal residual disease, and guiding treatment adjustments.  Though challenges remain in data interpretation and cost-effectiveness, the integration of genomic data into clinical decision-making promises a future of more precise, effective, and less toxic cancer treatments tailored to individual patient profiles.
