Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services, has undergone a transformative expansion, particularly accelerated by recent global events.  While predominantly studied through sociological and epidemiological lenses, this paper proposes a novel perspective, examining the underlying principles of telemedicine through the framework of quantum mechanics.  Specifically, we explore the concept of entanglement – the non-local correlation between seemingly disparate systems – as a metaphor for the interconnectedness of patient and provider in the telemedicine paradigm.  The transmission of medical data, encompassing images, physiological signals, and patient history, can be considered analogous to the transfer of quantum information, albeit classical in nature.  This perspective allows us to analyze challenges such as data security (akin to decoherence) and latency (analogous to the limitations of quantum communication channels).  Furthermore, we consider the role of observer effect – the influence of measurement on the observed system – in the context of remote diagnosis and the potential biases introduced by technological mediation.  This paper argues that a quantum-inspired theoretical framework offers a unique lens to critically assess the limitations and potentials of telemedicine in optimizing modern healthcare delivery, beyond conventional analytical approaches.
