Cancer is a complex disease driven by genetic alterations.  Advances in genomics have revolutionized our understanding of its etiology, paving the way for personalized medicine approaches. This presentation will explore recent breakthroughs in elucidating the genetic basis of cancer, highlighting the transition from broad-spectrum therapies to targeted treatments tailored to an individual's tumor profile.  We will discuss advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, which enable comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, identifying driver mutations and predicting therapeutic responses.  This allows clinicians to select the most effective therapies, minimizing adverse effects and maximizing treatment efficacy.  Practical applications will be examined, including the use of pharmacogenomics to predict drug metabolism and response, the development of novel targeted therapies such as kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy agents based on specific genetic alterations, and the implementation of liquid biopsies for minimally invasive cancer monitoring.  Finally, we will address challenges and future directions in the field, such as addressing the heterogeneity of cancers and developing robust predictive models for improved patient outcomes. The ultimate goal is to translate these genomic insights into tangible clinical benefits for cancer patients.
