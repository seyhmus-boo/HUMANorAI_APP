Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges in combating antibiotic resistance, a global health crisis with profound implications.  The emergence of multi-drug resistant bacteria presents a significant hurdle to effective treatment, threatening progress in various medical fields.  One key challenge lies in developing novel antibiotics.  The pipeline for new antibiotics is alarmingly dry, hampered by lengthy and costly research and development processes, coupled with limited market incentives.  Furthermore, identifying novel drug targets within resistant strains is difficult, as bacteria constantly evolve resistance mechanisms.  Experimental models also pose challenges.  In vitro studies often fail to accurately predict in vivo efficacy, while in vivo models require ethical considerations and may not fully replicate the complex human microbiome.  Finally,  tracking the spread of resistance genes across diverse bacterial populations, both geographically and within host organisms, requires sophisticated genomic surveillance techniques that are not universally accessible.  Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial to mitigating this global threat.
