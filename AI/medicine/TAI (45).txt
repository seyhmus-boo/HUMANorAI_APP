Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, yet establishing robust causal links between specific climate events and health outcomes presents considerable experimental challenges.  This presentation will explore these challenges, focusing on the inherent difficulties in isolating the effects of climate change from confounding factors.  We will discuss the limitations of observational studies, which are often hampered by complex interactions between climate variables, socioeconomic disparities, and pre-existing health conditions.  The ethical and logistical constraints of conducting large-scale, controlled experiments to directly assess climate change impacts on human health will be highlighted.  Furthermore, the presentation will address challenges related to predicting future health risks under varying climate scenarios, emphasizing the complexities of modelling complex systems and the need for interdisciplinary collaborations.  Finally, we will briefly explore innovative methodological approaches, such as the use of natural experiments and advanced statistical techniques, aiming to strengthen causal inference and enhance our understanding of the climate change-public health nexus despite these inherent experimental limitations.
