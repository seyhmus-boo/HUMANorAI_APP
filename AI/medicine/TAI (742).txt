Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding ongoing scrutiny. This presentation will examine key ethical dilemmas arising from the increasing disparity between organ demand and supply.  We will explore the tension between maximizing benefit through organ allocation and ensuring equitable access, considering recent developments in algorithmic allocation systems and their potential for bias.  The ethical implications of expanding donor pools, including the use of organs from donation after circulatory death (DCD) and the potential for incentivized donation, will be critically analyzed.  Further, we will discuss the ongoing debate surrounding the definition of death and the implications for organ procurement.  Recent advancements in xenotransplantation present unique ethical challenges, raising concerns regarding animal welfare, the potential for zoonotic disease transmission, and the equitable distribution of this potentially revolutionary technology.  Finally, the presentation will highlight the importance of robust ethical frameworks, transparent decision-making processes, and ongoing public engagement in navigating the complex moral landscape of organ transplantation.
