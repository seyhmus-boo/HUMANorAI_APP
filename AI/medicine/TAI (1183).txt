Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health.  This review synthesizes existing literature examining the complex interplay between a changing climate and human well-being.  Observed impacts include increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns and extreme weather events contribute to waterborne disease outbreaks and injuries from floods and storms.  Furthermore, shifting geographical distributions of disease vectors expand the range of infectious diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.  Food insecurity, exacerbated by altered agricultural yields and disrupted supply chains, contributes to malnutrition and undernutrition, especially in developing nations.  Mental health impacts are also increasingly recognized, stemming from displacement, trauma related to extreme events, and the psychological stress of living in a changing climate.  While substantial research highlights these detrimental effects, further investigation is needed to quantify the precise burden of disease attributable to climate change and to evaluate the effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation strategies.  A comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach is crucial for developing effective public health interventions and mitigating the adverse consequences of climate change on human health.
