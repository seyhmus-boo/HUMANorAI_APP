Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIST) have revolutionized surgery, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  However, the ongoing evolution of MIST presents significant experimental challenges hindering both the development and validation of new procedures and technologies. This paper explores the key experimental hurdles encountered in advancing MIST.  Traditional experimental models, often relying on large animal studies, struggle to fully replicate the complex human anatomy and physiology, leading to limitations in translating preclinical findings to clinical practice.  Furthermore, the inherent difficulty in accurately visualizing and manipulating tissues within confined spaces necessitates the development of advanced imaging and robotic systems, the rigorous testing of which presents unique methodological challenges.  This research examines the limitations of existing experimental methodologies, including the ethical considerations associated with animal models and the technological barriers in creating realistic in vitro and in silico simulations.  Finally, we discuss emerging strategies, such as advanced imaging techniques, sophisticated robotic systems, and the development of human-relevant in vitro models, that aim to address these experimental challenges and accelerate the progress of minimally invasive surgical innovation.
