Antibiotic resistance, the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of antibiotics, poses a significant global health threat with far-reaching implications.  Its historical trajectory is intrinsically linked to antibiotic discovery; the widespread use of these life-saving drugs, beginning in the mid-20th century, inadvertently selected for resistant strains through evolutionary pressure.  Bacteria possessing inherent or acquired resistance mechanisms, such as enzymatic inactivation or target modification, proliferate in the presence of antibiotics, leading to treatment failures.

This phenomenon transcends national borders.  The globalized movement of people, goods, and pathogens facilitates rapid dissemination of resistant strains.  Consequently, infections once easily treatable become increasingly difficult to manage, resulting in prolonged illnesses, higher mortality rates, and increased healthcare costs.  The impact extends beyond human health, affecting animal agriculture and food security through compromised livestock production and the potential for transmission of resistant bacteria to humans through the food chain.  Without concerted global efforts to combat antibiotic resistance through stewardship, infection control, and development of novel antimicrobial agents, the efficacy of modern medicine could be profoundly undermined.
