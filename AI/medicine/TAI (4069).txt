Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, particularly concerning experimental advancements. This presentation explores the ethical challenges posed by emerging technologies and research methodologies within transplantation.  We will examine the ethical implications of using novel organ sources, such as xenotransplantation and 3D-printed organs, highlighting the potential for exploitation of vulnerable populations involved in sourcing and the uncertainties surrounding long-term efficacy and safety.  Furthermore, we will discuss the allocation of scarce resources, including the ethical dilemmas raised by emerging technologies that may create new inequalities in access.  The use of artificial intelligence in organ allocation will also be critically analyzed, focusing on potential biases within algorithms and the need for transparency and accountability. Finally, we will consider the broader societal implications of these experimental approaches, encompassing issues of informed consent, patient autonomy, and the responsible conduct of research in this sensitive area.  The presentation aims to stimulate discussion and promote responsible innovation within the field of organ transplantation.
