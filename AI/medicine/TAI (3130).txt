Adolescence, a period of significant physical and psychological transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and development of mental health disorders. This paper examines current trends in the prevalence and presentation of mental health disorders among adolescents, focusing on anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use disorders.  We analyze existing epidemiological data to identify shifts in diagnostic rates and symptom profiles over recent decades, considering potential contributing factors such as societal changes, increased screen time, and the impact of social media.  Furthermore, the paper reviews current treatment approaches for adolescent mental health disorders, encompassing evidence-based psychotherapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), as well as pharmacological interventions and their efficacy.  A critical appraisal of the strengths and limitations of existing treatment modalities is undertaken, highlighting gaps in access to care and the need for integrated, multi-faceted approaches that address the unique developmental needs of this vulnerable population.  Finally, we discuss promising areas of future research, particularly in the development of preventative strategies and personalized interventions tailored to individual adolescent needs and risk profiles.
