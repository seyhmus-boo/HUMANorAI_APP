Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a remarkable evolution, driven by advancements in technology and a deeper understanding of surgical anatomy and physiology. Early MIS, largely laparoscopic, relied on rigid instruments limiting dexterity and visualization.  The introduction of flexible endoscopes and robotic systems significantly enhanced precision and control, overcoming these limitations.  Robotic surgery, in particular, offered improved ergonomics for surgeons, magnified 3D vision, and increased articulation, allowing for more complex procedures.  Concurrent developments in imaging technologies, such as enhanced visualization systems and intraoperative navigation, further refined surgical accuracy and reduced invasiveness.  Recent trends focus on further miniaturization, employing smaller incisions and natural orifices (NOTES).  These advancements, while improving patient outcomes, also necessitate ongoing development in training and simulation to optimize surgeon proficiency in these complex techniques.  Future directions involve the integration of artificial intelligence and advanced materials, potentially leading to even less invasive, personalized surgical approaches.
