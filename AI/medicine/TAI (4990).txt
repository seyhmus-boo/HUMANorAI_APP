Cancer's genetic basis, initially understood through the identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, has revolutionized oncology. Early research focused on broad genetic alterations common across cancer types. However, advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have unveiled the intricate landscape of somatic mutations within individual tumors, paving the way for personalized medicine.  

Historically, cancer treatment relied on generalized approaches. Now, genomic profiling identifies specific driver mutations, informing targeted therapies. For example, the presence of EGFR mutations in lung cancer predicts responsiveness to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  This personalized approach minimizes side effects associated with conventional chemotherapy, maximizing efficacy by targeting only cancerous cells harboring specific vulnerabilities.

Ongoing research explores the interplay of genetics, epigenetics, and the tumor microenvironment.  Integrating this complex data into predictive models holds immense potential for early detection, improved prognosis, and development of novel, highly targeted therapeutic interventions tailored to each patient's unique genetic profile, thereby shifting the paradigm from generalized to individualized cancer management.
