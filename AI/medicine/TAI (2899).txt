The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical area of study. Historically, while climate's impact on disease was understood –  think of cholera outbreaks linked to water contamination – the scale of anthropogenic climate change’s impact represents a novel challenge.  Rising temperatures exacerbate existing health problems. Heat stress, already responsible for significant mortality, is projected to increase dramatically.  Changing weather patterns influence the geographic distribution of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, expanding their reach into previously unaffected regions.  Extreme weather events, becoming more frequent and intense due to climate change, cause immediate injuries and fatalities, but also lead to displacement, food insecurity, and mental health challenges.  Further, air pollution, worsened by climate change, contributes to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular diseases.  Therefore, mitigating climate change is not merely an environmental imperative; it is a fundamental public health necessity, demanding integrated strategies that address both environmental and health vulnerabilities.
