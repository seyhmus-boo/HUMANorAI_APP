Antibiotic resistance, the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of antibiotics, poses a significant and escalating global health threat.  Its emergence is intrinsically linked to the widespread use of antibiotics since their discovery in the mid-20th century.  Initially heralded as miracle drugs, antibiotics rapidly transformed infectious disease management, yet their indiscriminate use in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture, has driven the selection and proliferation of resistant strains.  This selection pressure has led to the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, including those resistant to last-resort antibiotics, significantly compromising treatment options for a range of infections.  The global implications are profound, manifested in increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stays, higher healthcare costs, and compromised economic productivity.  The spread of resistant pathogens across geographical boundaries, facilitated by global travel and trade, further exacerbates the problem, demanding coordinated international efforts to curtail antibiotic overuse, develop novel therapeutic strategies, and implement robust surveillance systems to mitigate the impending crisis.  Effective stewardship programs, coupled with accelerated research into alternative antimicrobial agents and innovative diagnostic tools, are crucial for combating this global health challenge.
