Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, with impacts increasingly evident globally.  Recent research highlights the complex interplay between rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and the spread of infectious diseases.  Heat-related morbidity and mortality are escalating, particularly among vulnerable populations, while changes in precipitation patterns and sea levels exacerbate waterborne illnesses and displacement, respectively.  Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, are expanding their geographic ranges due to altered climatic conditions, challenging existing public health infrastructure.  Furthermore, air pollution exacerbated by climate change contributes significantly to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  Recent studies employing advanced modeling techniques have improved projections of climate-related health impacts, allowing for more targeted and effective interventions.  These include early warning systems for extreme heat events, enhanced vector control strategies, and the development of climate-resilient healthcare systems. Addressing climate change is therefore crucial not only for environmental sustainability but also for safeguarding global public health and ensuring health equity.
