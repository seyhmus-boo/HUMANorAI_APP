Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This abstract explores the complex interplay between environmental shifts and human well-being, highlighting crucial interdisciplinary links.  Rising temperatures directly increase morbidity and mortality through heatstroke and exacerbation of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.  Changes in precipitation patterns influence the distribution and prevalence of vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever, requiring collaboration between epidemiologists, climatologists, and entomologists.  Furthermore, extreme weather events, amplified by climate change, cause injuries, displacement, and mental health issues, necessitating input from disaster relief specialists, social scientists, and public health officials.  Food insecurity, resulting from altered agricultural yields and disrupted supply chains, contributes to malnutrition and infectious disease vulnerability, demanding integrated research across agricultural science, economics, and nutrition.  Effectively addressing this challenge requires integrating climate science data with epidemiological modeling, socioeconomic analyses, and public health interventions.  Interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for developing robust and adaptable strategies to protect public health in the face of a changing climate.
