Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents significant ethical dilemmas.  The scarcity of organs necessitates a system for allocation, raising questions of distributive justice.  Imagine a lottery system for a limited supply of life-saving medicine; fairness demands equal opportunity, yet some might argue for prioritizing those with the greatest chance of survival or societal contribution â€“ a form of utilitarian calculus.  This mirrors the debate around prioritization criteria for organ allocation, balancing egalitarian principles against consequentialist considerations.

Furthermore, the process involves informed consent, both from the donor (or their surrogate) and the recipient.  Coercion, even subtle, undermines the autonomy of the individual, analogous to forcing someone to donate blood against their will.  Similarly,  the potential for exploitation in obtaining organs, particularly from vulnerable populations, raises concerns akin to the ethical breaches in historical medical experimentation.  Finally, the definition of death itself, particularly brain death, remains a subject of ongoing philosophical and ethical debate, highlighting the complex interplay of medical, legal, and moral considerations inherent in organ transplantation.
