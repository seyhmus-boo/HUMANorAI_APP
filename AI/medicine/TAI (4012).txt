Adolescents experience a significant rise in mental health disorders, with trends indicating increasing prevalence across various conditions, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  This surge is attributed to a complex interplay of factors, encompassing societal pressures (e.g., academic competition, social media influence), biological vulnerabilities, and familial influences.  While precise causal mechanisms remain an area of ongoing research, longitudinal studies highlight the crucial role of early identification and intervention in mitigating long-term consequences. Treatment approaches have evolved to encompass a range of evidence-based modalities, tailored to the developmental stage and specific needs of the adolescent. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are frequently employed for anxiety and mood disorders, alongside psychopharmacological interventions where clinically indicated.  However, access to timely and appropriate care remains a significant challenge, particularly for marginalized youth.  Future research should focus on developing culturally sensitive and accessible interventions, improving early detection strategies, and investigating the efficacy of novel therapeutic approaches, such as mindfulness-based interventions and digital mental health platforms.  Addressing these critical needs is vital to improve adolescent mental health outcomes and prevent the escalation of disorders into adulthood.
