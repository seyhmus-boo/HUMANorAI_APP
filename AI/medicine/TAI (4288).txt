Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges inherent in translating our growing understanding of cancer's genetic basis into effective personalized medicine.  While genomic sequencing readily identifies somatic mutations driving tumorigenesis, translating this information into targeted therapies faces significant hurdles.

Firstly, the sheer complexity of cancer genomes presents a considerable challenge.  Intratumoral heterogeneity, where diverse clonal populations exist within a single tumour, means a single genomic profile may not capture the full picture, potentially leading to treatment resistance.  Secondly, functional validation of identified mutations remains a significant bottleneck.  In vitro and in vivo models often inadequately recapitulate the complex tumor microenvironment, hindering accurate prediction of therapeutic response.  Furthermore, the ethical considerations surrounding acquiring sufficient patient samples, especially for rare cancer subtypes, constrain large-scale studies crucial for validating therapeutic targets and personalizing treatment strategies.  Finally, the cost and accessibility of comprehensive genomic profiling present significant barriers to widespread implementation of personalized cancer medicine.  These experimental challenges underscore the need for continued innovation in both genomic technologies and preclinical modelling to fully realize the potential of personalized oncology.
