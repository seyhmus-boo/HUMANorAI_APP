Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIS) have revolutionized surgery, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This presentation traces the evolution of MIS, highlighting key advancements from early laparoscopic procedures to the sophisticated robotic and single-port approaches currently employed.  We will explore the technological innovations that have driven this progress, including improved imaging systems, miniaturized instrumentation, and the development of advanced energy sources for tissue dissection and hemostasis.  

The practical applications of these evolving techniques will be showcased through examples across diverse surgical specialties.  Specifically, we will examine the impact of MIS in areas such as cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery, and gynecological procedures, detailing the benefits and limitations of each approach. Furthermore, the presentation will address ongoing challenges, including the learning curve associated with new techniques, the need for specialized training, and the potential limitations in complex cases.  Finally, we will discuss future directions in MIS, including the integration of artificial intelligence and augmented reality, paving the way for even less invasive and more precise surgical interventions.
