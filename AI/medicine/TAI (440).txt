This presentation examines emerging trends in adolescent mental health disorders and highlights the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in effective treatment.  We will explore the rising prevalence of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors among young people, discussing contributing factors such as social media influence, academic pressure, and socioeconomic disparities.  The presentation will then analyze the limitations of traditional, siloed approaches to care, emphasizing the need for integrated services that incorporate psychological, psychiatric, and social support.  We will showcase successful models of interdisciplinary collaboration, including collaborative care models involving psychiatrists, therapists, school counselors, and social workers. The effectiveness of these models in improving treatment outcomes and reducing hospital readmissions will be discussed.  Finally, we will consider future directions in adolescent mental health, focusing on the integration of technology, early intervention strategies, and the development of culturally sensitive, accessible care. This presentation aims to underscore the urgent need for a holistic, interdisciplinary approach to address the growing mental health crisis among adolescents and improve their overall well-being.
