Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting notable trends in recent years.  Increased prevalence rates are observed across various diagnoses, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, potentially influenced by societal factors like increased academic pressure and social media usage.  Early intervention is crucial given the impact on long-term well-being and adult outcomes.  Treatment approaches are multifaceted and evidence-based.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) demonstrates efficacy in addressing anxiety and depression, while family-based therapies prove beneficial in engaging families in the therapeutic process.  Pharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), may be considered in conjunction with psychotherapy, contingent upon individual needs and careful risk assessment.  Future research necessitates exploring preventative strategies, addressing disparities in access to care, and investigating the long-term effects of emerging digital interventions.  A collaborative approach encompassing mental health professionals, educators, and families is essential for optimizing adolescent mental health outcomes.
