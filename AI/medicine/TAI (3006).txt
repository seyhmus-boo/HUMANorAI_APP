Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma compared to open surgery, has revolutionized surgical practice over the past few decades.  This paper explores the significant evolution of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, tracing its development from its nascent stages to its current sophisticated state.  Early advancements, such as laparoscopy, significantly improved patient outcomes by minimizing invasiveness, but were often limited by dexterity and visualization challenges.  However, continuous technological innovation has propelled MIS to new heights.  Recent developments, including the widespread adoption of robotic-assisted surgery, have addressed these limitations, offering enhanced precision, dexterity, and three-dimensional visualization.  Furthermore, the integration of advanced imaging modalities, such as augmented reality and intraoperative ultrasound, is enabling surgeons to perform increasingly complex procedures with greater accuracy. This paper will analyze the key technological advancements that have shaped the trajectory of MIS, critically assess their impact on surgical outcomes and patient recovery, and discuss emerging trends shaping the future of minimally invasive surgical techniques, including the potential of artificial intelligence and novel energy sources.
