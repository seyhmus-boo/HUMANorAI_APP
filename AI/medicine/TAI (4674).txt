**The Genetic Basis of Cancer: Advances in Personalized Medicine**

Cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease driven by somatic mutations accumulating within cells.  Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized our understanding of the genomic landscape of cancer, revealing a multitude of driver mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic alterations that contribute to tumorigenesis.  This presentation will explore the significant progress made in elucidating the genetic basis of various cancer types, focusing on the identification of actionable genomic alterations that inform targeted therapies. We will discuss the role of NGS in profiling tumor genomes, highlighting its utility in identifying specific mutations predictive of response to particular therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors or immune checkpoint inhibitors.  The implications of this increased knowledge for the development of personalized medicine strategies will be addressed.  Furthermore, we will delve into the challenges associated with implementing personalized oncology, including the complexities of interpreting genomic data, the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive genomic profiling, and the need for robust clinical trial designs to validate the efficacy of targeted therapies.  Finally, we will briefly examine the future directions of cancer genomics research, including the potential of liquid biopsies and the integration of multi-omics data for even more precise and effective cancer treatment strategies.
