This review examines current trends and treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents, a population experiencing a concerning rise in prevalence.  Data consistently indicate escalating rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors, particularly among girls.  Contributing factors include societal pressures, increased screen time, and the impact of social media.  While traditional therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic approaches remain effective,  emerging trends highlight the integration of technology-based interventions, such as mobile apps and telehealth, offering enhanced accessibility and engagement, particularly for adolescents.  Pharmacological interventions, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants, remain a cornerstone of treatment, albeit with careful consideration of potential side effects and individualized approaches.  However, significant disparities in access to quality mental healthcare persist, disproportionately affecting marginalized youth.  Further research is needed to explore the long-term efficacy of novel interventions, address disparities in care, and optimize prevention strategies targeting modifiable risk factors.  A holistic approach incorporating family involvement, peer support, and school-based interventions is crucial for improving adolescent mental health outcomes.
