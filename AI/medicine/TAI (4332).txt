Antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria to withstand antimicrobial drugs, poses a critical global health threat.  The rise in resistance is driven by factors including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, and agricultural practices.  This leads to the selection and proliferation of resistant strains, rendering previously effective treatments obsolete.

Recent developments underscore the urgency of this issue.  The emergence of pan-resistant bacteria, resistant to all available antibiotics, represents a grave concern.  Furthermore,  research highlights the increasingly complex mechanisms of resistance development, including horizontal gene transfer and the evolution of novel resistance determinants.  These developments complicate efforts to develop new antibiotics,  necessitating a multi-pronged approach.  This includes stringent antibiotic stewardship programs,  exploring alternative therapeutic strategies such as bacteriophages and immunotherapies, and investing heavily in the research and development of novel antimicrobial agents. Failure to address this global challenge will inevitably lead to increased morbidity and mortality, and severely impact healthcare systems worldwide.
