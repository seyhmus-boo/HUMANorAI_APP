Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have undergone significant evolution since their inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical dexterity.  Early MIS procedures, largely laparoscopic, relied on rigid endoscopes and limited articulation, resulting in a steep learning curve and restricted operative maneuverability.  Technological progress introduced flexible endoscopes, enhanced visualization through high-definition cameras and 3D imaging, and robotic platforms offering improved dexterity and precision.  Energy sources evolved from monopolar electrocautery to advanced bipolar systems, ultrasonic shears, and laser technologies, enabling more precise tissue dissection and hemostasis.  The development of smaller, more ergonomic instruments further minimized invasiveness.  Concurrent advancements in suturing techniques, including the use of robotic-assisted suturing and novel knot-tying methods, improved the precision and speed of surgical closure.  Current research focuses on expanding the applications of MIS, exploring augmented reality, artificial intelligence-assisted surgery, and single-port access to further refine these techniques and minimize patient trauma.  Future directions include personalized MIS strategies tailored to individual patient anatomy and physiology.
