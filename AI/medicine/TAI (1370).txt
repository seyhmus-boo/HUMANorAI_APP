Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery times, represents a paradigm shift in surgical practice.  This paper explores the evolutionary trajectory of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, tracing its development from nascent stages to its current sophisticated state.  Early attempts at minimally invasive approaches, while predating modern technology, can be identified in procedures like endoscopy, dating back to the late 19th century. However, the true genesis of MIS as a distinct surgical discipline can be attributed to the advent of laparoscopy in the mid-20th century.  Initially hampered by limited visualization and dexterity, early laparoscopic procedures were primarily diagnostic.  Subsequent technological advancements, including the development of improved optics, smaller instruments, and energy sources like lasers and electrocautery, propelled laparoscopy into a realm of therapeutic applicability.  This paper will examine the key technological breakthroughs that fueled this evolution, analyzing the transition from simple procedures to increasingly complex operations now routinely performed using MIS techniques.  Furthermore, it will discuss the ongoing development of robotic-assisted surgery and its impact on precision, dexterity, and the overall scope of minimally invasive surgical capabilities.
