The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical global challenge.  Historically, the impact of environmental factors on disease was understood through localized epidemiological studies, such as those linking cholera outbreaks to contaminated water sources in the 19th century. However, the scale and interconnectedness of climate change necessitates a more holistic perspective.  Rising global temperatures are already exacerbating existing health threats.  Increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves lead directly to heatstroke and cardiovascular complications, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to waterborne diseases through flooding and altered vector distributions.  Shifting climatic zones expand the geographical range of disease vectors like mosquitoes, leading to the increased incidence of vector-borne illnesses such as malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus.  Furthermore, extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and wildfires, cause immediate injuries and fatalities, as well as long-term mental health issues related to displacement and trauma.  The indirect effects of climate change, including food insecurity and malnutrition stemming from disrupted agricultural practices, further compound these health burdens, highlighting the urgent need for integrated strategies that address both climate mitigation and public health adaptation.
