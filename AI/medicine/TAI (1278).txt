Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting evolving trends and treatment approaches throughout history.  Historically, adolescent mental illness was often overlooked or attributed to adolescent "storm and stress," lacking rigorous diagnostic frameworks and effective interventions.  However, the past few decades have witnessed a rise in recognized diagnoses, particularly anxiety and depression, potentially reflecting increased awareness, improved diagnostic tools, and societal pressures.  Studies consistently reveal a gender disparity, with females experiencing higher rates of internalizing disorders.  While prevalence estimates vary across studies, the overall burden necessitates improved access to timely and appropriate care.  Treatment modalities have shifted from primarily institutionalization to a more diverse spectrum including psychopharmacology, psychotherapy (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy), and family-based interventions.  Emerging research explores the efficacy of digital mental health interventions and preventative strategies targeting risk factors such as socioeconomic disadvantage and adverse childhood experiences.  Further research is crucial to elucidate causal mechanisms, refine diagnostic criteria, and optimize treatment efficacy, ensuring equitable access to high-quality mental health services for all adolescents.
