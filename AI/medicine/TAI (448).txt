Vaccination plays a pivotal role in preventing infectious diseases by inducing a targeted immune response without causing the disease itself.  The process involves introducing a weakened or inactive form of a pathogen, or specific antigens derived from it, into the body. This initiates a primary immune response, leading to the production of memory B and T cells.  These memory cells remain in the body, providing immunological memory. Subsequent exposure to the actual pathogen triggers a rapid and robust secondary immune response, effectively neutralizing the infection before it can establish itself.

This principle underpins the practical application of vaccination in eradicating diseases like smallpox and significantly reducing the incidence of others such as polio, measles, and rubella.  Large-scale vaccination campaigns have demonstrably lowered morbidity and mortality rates associated with these diseases.  Moreover, herd immunity, achieved through high vaccination coverage within a population, protects even those individuals who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons.  Current research focuses on developing novel vaccine technologies, including mRNA vaccines and improved delivery systems, to enhance efficacy and broaden the scope of vaccine-preventable diseases.
