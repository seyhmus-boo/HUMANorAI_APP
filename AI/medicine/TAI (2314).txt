Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant threat to global health security, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  This presentation explores the complex interplay of factors driving AR's emergence and spread, highlighting the urgent need for collaboration across disciplines. We will examine the ecological drivers of resistance, including the impact of agricultural antibiotic use on the development of resistant bacteria in the environment and their subsequent transfer to human populations.  Furthermore, we will discuss the socio-economic implications of AR, considering healthcare system burden, the economic costs of treatment failures, and the impact on global development.  Crucially, we will analyse the role of behavioural science in shaping antibiotic stewardship and the development of effective public health interventions.  This requires integrating expertise from microbiology, epidemiology, ecology, economics, and behavioural science to design and implement comprehensive strategies addressing AR. The presentation will conclude by advocating for stronger interdisciplinary collaborations and a global, unified approach to combat this escalating crisis.  Successful mitigation requires not only technological advancements in novel antibiotics but also behavioural change, sustainable agricultural practices, and equitable access to healthcare.
