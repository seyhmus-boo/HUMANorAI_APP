Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  This complex issue transcends purely medical boundaries, encompassing ecological, social, and economic dimensions.  The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, driven by factors like inadequate infection control practices and agricultural applications, fuel the selection and spread of resistant bacteria.  Environmental science plays a critical role, highlighting the dissemination of resistant genes through wastewater and agricultural runoff.  Furthermore, social sciences contribute by investigating behavioural factors influencing antibiotic consumption and understanding the impact of AR on healthcare systems and societal well-being.  Economic analyses are crucial in evaluating the cost-effectiveness of interventions, from improved sanitation to novel diagnostic tools and antibiotic stewardship programs.  The interdisciplinary nature of AR necessitates collaboration between scientists, clinicians, policymakers, and economists to develop integrated strategies.  Effective solutions require a multifaceted approach encompassing improved infection control, responsible antibiotic use, development of alternative therapies, and robust surveillance systems, underpinned by strong global cooperation.  Failure to address AR comprehensively through an integrated, interdisciplinary lens risks catastrophic consequences for global health and economic stability.
