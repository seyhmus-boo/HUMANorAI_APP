Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding ongoing scrutiny.  This presentation examines key ethical dilemmas arising within the organ donation and transplantation process.  We will explore the tension between the principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice, highlighting instances where these principles conflict.  The allocation of scarce organs, a central challenge, will be discussed, considering the merits of various allocation systems and their potential for bias based on factors such as age, socioeconomic status, and race.  Furthermore, the ethical implications of living donation, including informed consent and the potential for coercion, will be analyzed.  We will also address the challenges associated with organ procurement, specifically focusing on the balance between respecting donor autonomy (or the autonomy of their families) and maximizing the availability of organs.  Finally, the presentation will briefly address emerging technologies, such as xenotransplantation and 3D bioprinting, and their potential ethical implications, advocating for robust ethical frameworks to guide future practices and ensure equitable access to life-saving treatments.
