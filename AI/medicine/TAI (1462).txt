Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma compared to open surgery, has revolutionized surgical practice over the past few decades.  This paper explores the significant evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving this progress.  From the initial laparoscopic approaches, the field has witnessed a rapid expansion encompassing robotic surgery, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), and single-port access techniques.  This evolution hasn't been solely driven by surgical innovation; rather, it represents a confluence of advancements in several disciplines.  Engineering has been paramount, contributing to the development of sophisticated instrumentation, high-resolution imaging systems, and robotic platforms.  Material science has played a critical role in refining suture materials, surgical meshes, and implants designed for minimally invasive applications.  Furthermore, advancements in computer science, through image processing and augmented reality technologies, have enhanced surgical precision and planning.  This research will delve into these interdisciplinary links, analyzing how their synergistic interaction has shaped the evolution of MIS techniques, ultimately improving patient outcomes and expanding the scope of surgical possibilities.  The paper will conclude by discussing future directions and potential challenges in the continued advancement of this rapidly evolving field.
