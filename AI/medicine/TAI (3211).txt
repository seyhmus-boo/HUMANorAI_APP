Climate change poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health.  This presentation explores the complex and multifaceted relationship between a changing climate and human well-being, drawing on historical context to contextualize contemporary challenges.  Historically, climate variability has always impacted human health, from localized famines exacerbated by droughts to the spread of infectious diseases influenced by temperature and precipitation patterns. However, the unprecedented scale and pace of anthropogenic climate change introduces novel risks.  We will examine the direct impacts, including heat-related mortality and morbidity, exacerbated respiratory illnesses due to air pollution, and the increased prevalence of vector-borne diseases.  Furthermore, the indirect effects, such as malnutrition stemming from disrupted agricultural systems, mental health consequences of displacement and extreme weather events, and increased competition for resources leading to conflict, will be discussed.  The presentation will conclude by highlighting the urgent need for integrated, multi-sectoral approaches to mitigate climate change and build climate-resilient health systems capable of addressing the escalating public health challenges of a warming world.  We will briefly consider implications for equitable resource allocation and vulnerable populations disproportionately affected by these changes.
