Organ transplantation, a cornerstone of modern medicine, is fraught with complex ethical dilemmas. Historically, early transplants, often performed without robust consent procedures, raised profound questions about patient autonomy and the commodification of the body.  The development of the "dead donor rule," stipulating that organ retrieval only occur post-mortem, aimed to address concerns around exploitation and the potential for premature death.  However, defining death itself, particularly brain death, remains contentious, necessitating rigorous legal and medical frameworks.

Contemporary ethical challenges centre around allocation justice.  Scarcity necessitates prioritizing recipients, leading to debates over criteria such as medical urgency, prognosis, and lifestyle choices.  Implicit biases within allocation systems, potentially disadvantaging certain demographics, require critical examination.  Furthermore, the emergence of living donation introduces ethical complexities related to donor coercion, informed consent, and the potential for exploitation, particularly within vulnerable populations.  Finally, the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation raises novel issues concerning animal welfare, the risk of zoonotic disease transmission, and potential ecological consequences.  Addressing these ethical quandaries necessitates ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue and the development of robust, transparent, and equitable allocation policies.
