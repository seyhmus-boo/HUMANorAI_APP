Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma compared to open surgery, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This paper explores the significant evolution of surgical techniques within the MIS field, tracing its development from rudimentary beginnings to the sophisticated procedures available today. The historical trajectory of MIS can be partially attributed to the advancements in imaging technology, starting with early endoscopy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, which allowed for visualization of internal organs without extensive incisions.  Early laparoscopic cholecystectomies, pioneered in the 1980s, marked a pivotal moment, showcasing the potential of MIS to replace traditional open techniques for specific procedures.  However, initial limitations, such as restricted dexterity and two-dimensional visualization, hampered widespread adoption. Subsequent advancements, including the development of refined instrumentation, three-dimensional laparoscopy, robotic surgery, and enhanced imaging modalities like fluorescence imaging and augmented reality, have substantially improved precision, dexterity, and surgeon control. This paper examines these key technological breakthroughs, analyzing their impact on surgical outcomes, patient recovery, and the expansion of MIS into a wider range of surgical specialties. We will further investigate the ongoing challenges and future directions of MIS, focusing on the potential for further miniaturization, automation, and personalized surgical approaches.
