Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting concerning trends toward increased prevalence and earlier onset.  This review examines recent literature highlighting rising rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors amongst this vulnerable population.  Contributing factors, including societal pressures, technological influences, and biological vulnerabilities, are complex and intertwined.

Treatment approaches are evolving, shifting towards integrated care models emphasizing early intervention and a holistic approach.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) demonstrate consistent efficacy in managing anxiety and mood disorders.  Pharmacological interventions, though sometimes necessary, are increasingly considered alongside therapeutic modalities.  Practical applications include integrating mental health screening into routine adolescent healthcare,  promoting mental health literacy within schools and communities, and training educators and caregivers in recognizing warning signs.  Further research is crucial to understand the long-term impact of early interventions and to address disparities in access to quality mental healthcare for adolescents, particularly from marginalized communities.  Ultimately, a multi-faceted approach encompassing prevention, early detection, and comprehensive treatment is vital to improve outcomes for this population.
