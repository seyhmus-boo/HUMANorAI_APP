Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma and faster recovery times.  This presentation explores the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, focusing on the significant experimental challenges encountered throughout its development.  Early advancements, such as laparoscopy, faced limitations in dexterity and visualization, necessitating the development of specialized instruments and improved imaging modalities.  The transition to robotic surgery introduced further complexities, requiring rigorous testing of precision, haptic feedback, and system reliability in both in-vitro and in-vivo settings.  Furthermore, the integration of advanced technologies like augmented reality and artificial intelligence presents novel experimental hurdles, demanding robust validation of safety and efficacy alongside rigorous ethical considerations.  This presentation will analyze key experimental challenges across these evolutionary stages, highlighting the interplay between technological innovation and the stringent demands of surgical precision, patient safety, and translational research. We will conclude by discussing the ongoing need for sophisticated experimental designs to accelerate the development and validation of future MIS techniques.
