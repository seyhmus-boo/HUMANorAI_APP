Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the burgeoning field of personalized cancer medicine, driven by advancements in our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer.  Historically, cancer treatment was largely generalized.  However, we now recognize that cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease, driven by specific genetic alterations within individual tumors.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are revolutionizing our ability to identify these mutations, facilitating the development of targeted therapies.

Recent breakthroughs include improved detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) via circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, allowing for earlier relapse prediction and intervention.  Furthermore, the identification of novel oncogenic drivers, particularly in less common cancers, continues to expand the scope of targeted therapies.  Immunotherapy, though not strictly genetic, is significantly enhanced by understanding the tumor's mutational landscape and its impact on immune evasion mechanisms.  The integration of genomic data with clinical information and sophisticated bioinformatics is proving crucial for developing truly personalized treatment strategies, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes and a move beyond one-size-fits-all approaches.
