Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents significant challenges to developing effective personalized medicine. While advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, translating this information into actionable therapeutic strategies remains difficult.  Experimental hurdles include identifying driver mutations from passenger mutations amidst the high mutational burden frequently observed in cancer.  Furthermore, the complex interplay between somatic mutations, germline predispositions, and the tumor microenvironment necessitates sophisticated experimental models that accurately recapitulate this intricate ecosystem.  Current *in vitro* and *in vivo* models often fail to fully capture the tumor's dynamic evolution and response to therapy, hindering the accurate prediction of treatment efficacy.  Challenges also exist in developing and validating robust biomarkers to monitor therapeutic response and predict relapse, particularly given the emergence of drug resistance.  Overcoming these experimental limitations requires integration of multi-omics data with advanced computational approaches, innovative preclinical models that better mirror human tumor heterogeneity, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting specific vulnerabilities identified through genomic profiling.  Addressing these challenges is crucial for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer medicine.
