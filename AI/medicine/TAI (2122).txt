Climate change poses a significant and evolving threat to public health, demanding urgent interdisciplinary attention. This presentation examines the multifaceted relationship between these two critical issues, tracing its historical understanding from early observations of weather-related mortality to the current recognition of climate change as a primary driver of health risks.  Historically, the focus was largely on immediate impacts like heat waves and extreme weather events. However, research increasingly highlights the more insidious, long-term consequences.  We will explore the expanding evidence linking climate change to increased vector-borne diseases, respiratory illnesses exacerbated by air pollution, malnutrition due to agricultural disruptions, and mental health challenges stemming from displacement and environmental trauma.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the disproportionate impact of climate change on vulnerable populations, including low-income communities and marginalized groups.  Finally, we will discuss crucial avenues for future research, emphasizing the need for robust surveillance systems, effective adaptation strategies, and policy interventions to mitigate the escalating health burden of a changing climate and promote climate justice.
