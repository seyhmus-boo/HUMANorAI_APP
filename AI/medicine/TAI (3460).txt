The global rise of antibiotic resistance presents a significant challenge to public health, threatening the efficacy of treatments for bacterial infections.  This resistance, driven by selective pressure from antibiotic overuse and misuse, manifests through various mechanisms, including enzymatic inactivation, target modification, and efflux pump overexpression.  Experimentally, studying antibiotic resistance faces several hurdles.  Firstly, accurately modelling the complex interplay of bacterial populations, genetic diversity, and environmental factors within a host is challenging. In vitro experiments often fail to capture the in vivo dynamics of infection and the contribution of the host immune system.  Secondly, identifying novel resistance mechanisms requires sophisticated genomic and proteomic analyses, particularly for bacteria exhibiting multi-drug resistance. The sheer diversity of bacterial species and the rapid evolution of resistance genes further complicates experimental design and data interpretation.  Finally, developing and validating new antibiotics is a protracted and costly process, hampered by the difficulty in identifying compounds that effectively overcome existing resistance mechanisms while remaining non-toxic to the host.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is crucial for developing effective strategies to combat this escalating global health crisis.
