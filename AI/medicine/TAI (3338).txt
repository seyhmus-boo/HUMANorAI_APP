The genetic basis of cancer is increasingly informing the development of personalized medicine strategies.  Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, identifying recurrent somatic mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic alterations that drive oncogenesis. This detailed molecular characterization allows for the stratification of patients into subgroups based on specific genetic drivers, facilitating the selection of targeted therapies with improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy. For instance, the identification of *EGFR* mutations in non-small cell lung cancer has led to the successful application of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Similarly, the detection of *BRAF* V600E mutations in melanoma has paved the way for the use of BRAF inhibitors.  Furthermore, the discovery of tumor mutational burden (TMB) as a predictive biomarker has opened avenues for immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors, whose efficacy correlates with the presence of a high TMB.  Ongoing research focuses on integrating genomic data with other omics data, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to further refine predictive models and develop more precise and effective personalized cancer treatments, ultimately improving patient outcomes and survival rates.  Challenges remain in addressing the cost and accessibility of comprehensive genomic testing and in managing the complexity of interpreting large-scale genomic data.
