Cancer's genetic basis is increasingly central to personalized medicine.  Advances in genomic sequencing have revealed the complex interplay of mutations driving tumorigenesis.  These mutations, affecting oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair pathways, vary significantly between individuals and even within a single tumor.  This heterogeneity explains differing responses to conventional therapies.

Personalized medicine leverages this knowledge to tailor treatment strategies.  For instance, identifying specific gene mutations, such as EGFR mutations in lung cancer, allows for targeted therapy with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, offering significantly improved outcomes compared to generic chemotherapy.  Similarly, pharmacogenomics identifies genetic variations affecting drug metabolism, enabling prediction of drug efficacy and toxicity, thereby optimizing treatment choices.  Furthermore, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis allows for non-invasive monitoring of treatment response and detection of minimal residual disease, facilitating early intervention in recurrence.  Continued advancements in genomic technology promise to further refine our understanding and personalize cancer treatment, leading to more effective and less toxic therapies.
