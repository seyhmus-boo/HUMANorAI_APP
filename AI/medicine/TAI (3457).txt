Artificial intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential for healthcare diagnostics, offering the prospect of faster, more accurate, and accessible diagnoses. However, realizing this potential faces significant experimental challenges.  This abstract focuses on key limitations hindering the robust validation and widespread implementation of AI diagnostic tools.  A primary challenge lies in the acquisition and curation of high-quality, representative training datasets.  Bias in data, stemming from demographic disparities or acquisition methodologies, can lead to AI models that perform poorly or inequitably across patient populations.  Further complicating matters is the "black box" nature of many AI algorithms, hindering interpretability and limiting clinician trust and adoption.  Establishing rigorous evaluation metrics that accurately reflect clinical performance beyond simple accuracy, encompassing aspects like sensitivity, specificity, and clinical utility in diverse settings, remains a crucial challenge.  Finally, the integration of AI tools into existing clinical workflows requires careful consideration of usability, interoperability, and ethical implications, necessitating robust experimental paradigms addressing human-computer interaction and the impact on healthcare systems.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is paramount to ensuring the safe and effective deployment of AI in healthcare diagnostics.
