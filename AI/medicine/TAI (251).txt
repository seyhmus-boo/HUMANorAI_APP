Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery times, represents a significant advancement in surgical practice.  This paper explores the evolution of surgical techniques within this field, tracing its development from rudimentary approaches to the sophisticated technologies employed today.  The historical roots of MIS can be found in early endoscopic procedures, notably the pioneering work of Philipp Bozzini in the early 19th century with his "Lichtleiter," an early endoscope.  However, significant progress remained elusive until the latter half of the 20th century, hampered by limitations in imaging and instrumentation.  The advent of laparoscopy in the 1980s, facilitated by advancements in fiber optics and camera technology, marked a pivotal moment, allowing surgeons to perform complex procedures through small incisions.  This initial surge spurred rapid innovation, leading to the development of specialized instruments, improved imaging modalities such as robotic surgery, and refined surgical techniques.  This research will analyze the key technological advancements driving this evolution, examining their impact on surgical outcomes, patient experience, and the broader landscape of healthcare.  Furthermore, it will discuss the ongoing challenges and future directions in MIS, considering the potential of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and augmented reality.
