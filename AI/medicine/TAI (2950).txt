Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant threat to global health security, demanding an interdisciplinary response that transcends traditional medical boundaries.  The rise of multidrug-resistant pathogens necessitates a unified approach integrating medical, ecological, agricultural, and social sciences.  This abstract highlights the crucial interconnections driving AR dissemination.  Agricultural practices, particularly the widespread use of antibiotics in livestock, contribute significantly to the emergence and spread of resistant genes into the environment, impacting human health via the food chain and contaminated water sources.  Social determinants of health, including access to healthcare, sanitation, and hygiene practices, profoundly influence the prevalence and transmission of resistant infections.  Furthermore, the complex interplay between bacterial evolution, genetic exchange mechanisms, and selective pressures exerted by antibiotic use necessitates a comprehensive understanding from microbiological and evolutionary perspectives.  Effective mitigation strategies require collaborative efforts across disciplines to develop novel antibiotics, improve stewardship programs, and implement robust surveillance systems.  Interdisciplinary research focusing on ecological drivers, socio-economic factors, and innovative technological solutions is essential to combat this global health crisis and ensure sustainable healthcare systems.
