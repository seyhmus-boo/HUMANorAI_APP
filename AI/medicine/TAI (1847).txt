Telemedicine has rapidly evolved from a niche application to a crucial component of modern healthcare delivery, significantly impacted by recent technological advancements and the exigencies of the COVID-19 pandemic. This presentation will explore the expanding role of telemedicine in enhancing healthcare accessibility, affordability, and efficiency.  We will examine recent developments in remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies, including the proliferation of wearable sensors and AI-driven diagnostic tools, which facilitate proactive health management and early disease detection.  Further, we will discuss the integration of telehealth platforms with electronic health records (EHRs) to improve data interoperability and streamline care coordination.  The presentation will also address challenges associated with telemedicine implementation, such as ensuring equitable access, addressing digital literacy disparities, and maintaining data privacy and security.  Finally, we will consider the evolving regulatory landscape and its influence on the future trajectory of telemedicine, including its potential to reshape healthcare workforce models and improve patient outcomes across diverse populations.
