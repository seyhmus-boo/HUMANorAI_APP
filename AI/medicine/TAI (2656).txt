This review summarizes current trends and treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents.  Prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders are significantly increasing, with notable disparities across socioeconomic and demographic groups.  Early onset and untreated disorders often lead to persistent difficulties in adulthood, highlighting the urgency for timely intervention.  While evidence-based treatments exist, access remains a significant barrier. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and medication, often used concurrently, demonstrate efficacy for several disorders. However, the optimal treatment approach varies based on individual needs and disorder severity.  Emerging trends focus on integrating technology-assisted interventions, such as telehealth and mobile apps, to improve access and engagement.  Nevertheless, challenges remain in addressing the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to adolescent mental health.  Future research should prioritize developing culturally sensitive interventions, addressing health disparities, and evaluating the long-term effectiveness of emerging treatments to improve outcomes for this vulnerable population.
