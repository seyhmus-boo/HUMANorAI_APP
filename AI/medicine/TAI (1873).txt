Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health. This presentation explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human health outcomes, focusing on both direct and indirect impacts. Direct effects include increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, exacerbated by extreme weather events such as floods and droughts leading to injuries and displacement.  Indirect effects are equally concerning, encompassing the expansion of vector-borne diseases, altered allergenic pollen seasons, and disruptions to food security and water resources, all contributing to malnutrition and infectious disease outbreaks.  We will examine the disproportionate burden of these health impacts on vulnerable populations, including low-income communities and marginalized groups.  Furthermore, the presentation will review existing literature on climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies relevant to public health, highlighting the crucial role of integrated approaches encompassing environmental protection, healthcare infrastructure improvements, and public health policy interventions.  Finally, we will discuss the need for enhanced surveillance systems and research to better understand and address the evolving public health challenges posed by climate change, ultimately advocating for proactive and collaborative strategies to build climate-resilient health systems.
