The intricate relationship between climate change and public health is typically analyzed through epidemiological and socio-economic lenses. However, this paper proposes a novel perspective, exploring this complex interplay through the lens of quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate fields, the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics offer a unique framework for understanding the emergent, non-linear dynamics inherent in climate change's impact on human well-being.  Specifically, we argue that the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena can illuminate the stochasticity observed in disease outbreaks, vector-borne illnesses, and the exacerbation of pre-existing health conditions, all driven by climate variability.  Furthermore, the concept of entanglement, where separate systems become interconnected, can be conceptually applied to understand the complex feedback loops between environmental changes, societal responses, and resultant public health outcomes. This paper will explore these conceptual analogies, investigating how quantum-inspired computational methods can improve predictive modelling of climate-related health risks and ultimately contribute to more effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.  Our focus will be on the methodological implications rather than a literal application of quantum mechanics to biological systems.
