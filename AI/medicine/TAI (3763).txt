Recent advances in understanding the genetic basis of cancer have significantly propelled the field of personalized medicine.  This review summarizes key developments and their practical applications.  High-throughput sequencing technologies now allow for comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, identifying specific driver mutations and characterizing the tumor's unique mutational landscape.  This information is crucial for selecting targeted therapies, moving beyond the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach.  For instance, identification of EGFR mutations in lung cancer facilitates the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, leading to improved patient outcomes.  Similarly, genomic profiling guides the selection of immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors, by identifying patients likely to respond based on tumor mutational burden or specific neoantigen profiles.  Challenges remain, including the complexity of interpreting genomic data, managing treatment-related toxicities, and addressing the high cost of these technologies.  Despite these hurdles, the integration of genetic information into cancer care is rapidly improving diagnosis, treatment selection, and prognosis, promising a future where cancer treatment is truly personalized and optimized for individual patients.  Future research should focus on developing more accurate predictive biomarkers and cost-effective strategies for wider implementation.
