Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, undermining modern medicine and jeopardizing global health security.  This presentation will examine the multifaceted nature of AR, exploring the complex interplay of factors driving its emergence and spread, including overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal health, inadequate sanitation, and the global dissemination of resistant pathogens. The significant human cost, encompassing increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenditure, will be highlighted, along with the economic burden on healthcare systems worldwide.

Beyond the clinical challenges, we will discuss the significant impact on food security, particularly in the context of livestock farming and aquaculture. The presentation will then transition to practical applications, outlining strategies for combating AR.  This includes promoting responsible antibiotic stewardship through improved prescribing practices and public health education; strengthening surveillance systems for monitoring resistance patterns; and accelerating the development and implementation of innovative diagnostic tools and alternative therapies, such as phage therapy and antimicrobial peptides.  Finally, we will emphasize the crucial role of international collaboration and policy interventions in mitigating the global AR crisis, urging a multi-sectoral approach to address this pressing public health challenge.
