Adolescents experience a significant burden of mental health disorders, with rising prevalence rates observed globally for conditions such as anxiety, depression, and self-harm.  These trends are influenced by complex interplay of biological, psychological, and socio-cultural factors, including increased academic pressure, social media usage, and societal inequalities.  Effective early intervention is crucial, given the potential for long-term consequences on academic achievement, social functioning, and overall well-being.  Current treatment approaches encompass a range of evidence-based therapies, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacology, often implemented in integrated care models.  However, access to timely and appropriate care remains a major challenge, particularly for vulnerable populations.  Future research should focus on refining diagnostic tools, developing culturally sensitive interventions, and improving accessibility to mental health services through technological innovations like telehealth and school-based programs. Practical applications include the implementation of universal screening programs in schools, the training of educators and primary care providers in early identification and referral strategies, and the development of accessible, cost-effective interventions tailored to specific adolescent needs and contexts.  Addressing these challenges is vital for mitigating the long-term impact of adolescent mental health disorders.
