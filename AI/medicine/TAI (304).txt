Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice over the past few decades. This paper examines the evolution of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, tracing its progression from early laparoscopic approaches to the sophisticated technologies employed today.  The initial adoption of laparoscopy, while groundbreaking, was hampered by limitations in visualization and dexterity.  This spurred the development of advanced instrumentation, including enhanced endoscopic cameras, articulated instruments, and robotic systems, significantly improving precision and control.  Furthermore, the incorporation of imaging modalities such as ultrasound and intraoperative fluorescence imaging has further refined surgical planning and execution.  This technological evolution has expanded the practical applications of MIS, broadening its scope from initially limited procedures to a wide range of complex surgeries across multiple specialties.  The paper will explore the key advancements driving this evolution, analyzing their impact on patient outcomes, including reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times.  Finally, we will discuss emerging trends and future directions in MIS, considering the potential of artificial intelligence and further technological integration.
