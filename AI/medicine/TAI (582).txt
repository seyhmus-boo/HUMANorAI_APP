Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, yet its evolution presents ongoing experimental challenges.  Early MIS techniques, relying on rudimentary instrumentation and 2D visualization, faced limitations in dexterity and precision.  Advances, such as robotic surgery and enhanced imaging modalities (3D laparoscopy, fluorescence guidance), have addressed these, but introduced new complexities.  Experimental validation of novel instruments and techniques necessitates robust in vitro and in vivo models accurately mimicking human tissue properties and surgical scenarios.  Developing realistic simulations, encompassing tissue viscoelasticity, haptic feedback, and bleeding, remains a major hurdle.  Furthermore, evaluating the long-term efficacy and safety of new MIS approaches requires large-scale, longitudinal clinical studies, often hampered by inherent variability in patient populations and surgical expertise.  Standardization of surgical metrics and outcomes is crucial for meaningful comparison across different techniques and institutions.  Future research should focus on improving simulation fidelity, developing objective performance indicators, and establishing robust methodologies for preclinical and clinical evaluation to accelerate the responsible evolution of MIS.
