Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's ability to treat bacterial infections. This presentation will explore the multifaceted nature of AR, examining its underlying mechanisms, driving factors, and far-reaching consequences.  We will discuss the role of selective pressure exerted by antibiotic overuse and misuse in both human and animal health sectors, highlighting the contribution of agricultural practices and inadequate infection control measures.  The global dissemination of resistant strains, facilitated by international travel and trade, will be addressed, emphasizing the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens as a particularly concerning phenomenon.  The socioeconomic implications of AR will also be examined, including increased healthcare costs, prolonged hospital stays, and reduced productivity. Finally, we will briefly review current strategies aimed at combating AR, including surveillance efforts, the development of novel antibiotics and alternative therapies, and the promotion of responsible antibiotic stewardship programs.  Effective global collaboration, coupled with policy changes and behavioral modifications, are critical to mitigating this critical threat to global health security.
