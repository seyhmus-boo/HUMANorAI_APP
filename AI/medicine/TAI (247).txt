Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), a paradigm shift in surgical practice, has undergone remarkable evolution since its inception. Early attempts, dating back to the late 19th century with laparoscopy's nascent use in gynecology, were hampered by limited visualization and instrumentation.  The mid-20th century saw gradual advancements, with improved optics and the introduction of basic instruments. However, true progress accelerated with the development of fiber optics and improved video technology in the latter half of the century.  This enabled surgeons to perform more complex procedures with enhanced precision and less invasiveness.

The subsequent decades witnessed a rapid expansion of MIS, driven by technological innovation.  Robotic-assisted surgery, offering dexterity and precision exceeding human capabilities, revolutionized many surgical fields.  Simultaneously, advancements in imaging technologies, such as 3D laparoscopy and intraoperative ultrasound, further enhanced surgical visualization and planning.  Minimally invasive techniques continue to evolve, incorporating advanced energy sources, improved instrumentation, and virtual reality simulations for enhanced training and precision.  While challenges remain in areas like dexterity limitations and learning curves,  the trajectory of MIS points towards even less invasive, more effective, and safer surgical interventions in the future.
