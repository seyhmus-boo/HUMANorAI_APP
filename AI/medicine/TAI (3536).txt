Organ transplantation offers life-saving potential, yet its implementation necessitates careful ethical navigation. This presentation examines key ethical considerations inherent in the process, focusing on three crucial areas: donor consent and allocation, the potential for exploitation and coercion, and the equitable distribution of scarce resources.  We will explore the complexities of informed consent, particularly in cases of deceased donation, highlighting the nuances of family surrogate decision-making and the potential for undue influence.  The presentation will also analyze the ethical implications of various allocation systems, comparing utilitarian approaches prioritizing the greatest good with deontological frameworks emphasizing fairness and individual rights.  Further, we will address the disproportionate impact of organ scarcity on marginalized populations, examining potential solutions for promoting equity and minimizing disparities in access.  Practical applications of these considerations will be illustrated through case studies and policy recommendations, including best practices for donor recruitment, transparent allocation protocols, and initiatives designed to enhance equitable access to transplantation services. The ultimate goal is to foster a more ethically sound and just organ transplantation system.
