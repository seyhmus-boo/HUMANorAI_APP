Adolescence, a period of significant biological and psychosocial transition, is marked by a heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders.  This paper examines recent trends in the prevalence and presentation of common adolescent mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.  We synthesize existing literature to analyze evolving diagnostic criteria, epidemiological data revealing shifts in disorder prevalence and comorbidity, and the influence of societal factors such as social media and academic pressures.  Furthermore, this review critically assesses the efficacy and accessibility of current treatment modalities, encompassing both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions.  A specific focus is placed on the limitations of existing approaches, particularly regarding early identification, tailored interventions for diverse populations, and the persistent disparities in access to quality mental healthcare.  Ultimately, this research aims to identify critical gaps in current knowledge and practice, highlighting areas requiring further investigation and innovative strategies to improve the mental health outcomes of adolescents.  We conclude by proposing directions for future research and advocating for a multi-faceted approach to prevention and treatment that integrates community-based initiatives with evidence-based clinical practices.
