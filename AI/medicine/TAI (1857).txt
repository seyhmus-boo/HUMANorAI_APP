While quantum mechanics doesn't directly govern the macroscopic mechanics of surgical tools, its underlying principles offer a theoretical framework for understanding the evolution of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques.  The drive towards miniaturization in MIS reflects a pursuit of reduced invasiveness, analogous to a quantum system's tendency towards lower energy states.  Larger incisions, representing a higher energy state, are progressively replaced by smaller, less disruptive approaches.  The development of smaller instruments, robotic manipulators, and flexible endoscopes mirrors the concept of wave-particle duality; instruments behaving as both rigid manipulators and flexible probes, adapting to complex anatomical environments.  Improved image resolution in techniques like laparoscopy and endoscopy can be viewed as a reduction in the uncertainty principle applied to surgical visualization, yielding a clearer understanding of the operational "space" despite its miniaturization.  Furthermore, advancements in materials science, leading to biocompatible and durable miniature devices, demonstrate a parallel to the precise quantum tailoring of material properties at the atomic level.  Therefore, though not a direct application, a quantum mechanical analogy provides a useful framework for understanding the underlying principles driving the progressive refinement and miniaturization inherent to the evolution of MIS.
