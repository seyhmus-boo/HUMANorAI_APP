Advances in understanding the genetic basis of cancer have revolutionized personalized medicine, paving the way for targeted therapies and improved patient outcomes.  This review summarizes key developments in this rapidly evolving field.  Next-generation sequencing technologies have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling, identifying driver mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic alterations that underpin specific cancer types and subtypes. This detailed genetic characterization allows for the stratification of patients into distinct molecular subgroups, facilitating the selection of tailored therapeutic approaches.  Targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, have demonstrated significant efficacy in treating cancers harboring specific genetic aberrations.  However, challenges remain, including the development of resistance mechanisms and the identification of biomarkers predictive of response to specific treatments.  Furthermore, the high cost and complex interpretation of genomic data necessitate the development of efficient and accessible analytical tools.  Future research should focus on integrating multi-omics data, developing more robust predictive biomarkers, and addressing health disparities in access to personalized cancer care. This will ultimately lead to further advancements in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer.
