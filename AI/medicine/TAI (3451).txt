Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This abstract explores the complex interplay between climate change impacts and human health outcomes, highlighting key interdisciplinary links.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly impacting vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns influence the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, requiring collaboration between epidemiologists, climatologists, and entomologists.  Extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, disrupt healthcare infrastructure and displace populations, leading to increased rates of injury, infectious disease outbreaks, and mental health issues.  Food insecurity, resulting from altered agricultural yields, contributes to malnutrition and associated health problems.  Furthermore, air pollution, exacerbated by climate change, worsens respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, demanding expertise from environmental scientists and public health officials.  Addressing these challenges necessitates integrating knowledge from diverse fields, fostering collaborations between climate scientists, epidemiologists, ecologists, social scientists, and public health practitioners to develop effective and equitable solutions.  A holistic, interdisciplinary framework is crucial for building climate-resilient health systems and protecting vulnerable populations from the escalating health burdens of a changing climate.
