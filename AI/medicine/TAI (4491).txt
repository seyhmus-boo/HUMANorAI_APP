Cancer, a complex disease with diverse etiologies, has historically been treated with broad-spectrum therapies, often resulting in significant side effects.  However, advancements in understanding the genetic basis of cancer have revolutionized our approach, paving the way for personalized medicine. This presentation will explore the historical context of cancer research, from early observations of chromosomal abnormalities to the current era of high-throughput sequencing. We will examine key milestones such as the identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, and discuss how this knowledge has led to the development of targeted therapies.  Specifically, we will focus on how genomic profiling, including whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, is utilized to identify specific cancer driver mutations, informing the selection of individualized treatment strategies.  The presentation will further explore the challenges and limitations of current personalized approaches, such as the cost and accessibility of genomic testing, as well as the emergence of drug resistance. Finally, we will briefly discuss the future direction of cancer research, including the potential of immunotherapy and gene editing technologies to further refine personalized cancer treatment strategies and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
