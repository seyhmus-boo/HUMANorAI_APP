Cancer's genetic underpinnings have been a central focus of research since the discovery of oncogenes in the 1970s.  Early understanding focused on identifying single gene mutations driving uncontrolled cell growth. This paved the way for targeted therapies, initially showing promise but often limited by acquired resistance.  The advent of next-generation sequencing has revolutionized our understanding, revealing the complex interplay of numerous genomic alterations, including mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic modifications, contributing to tumorigenesis. This complexity necessitates a move towards personalized medicine.

This presentation will discuss recent advances in our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity within and between cancers.  We will explore the implications of this heterogeneity for developing effective personalized therapies, emphasizing the role of genomic profiling in guiding treatment selection.  Examples will be presented demonstrating the successes and challenges of using genomic data to predict patient response to targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy.  We will also briefly address the ethical and logistical considerations inherent in implementing personalized oncology strategies, including data management, access to testing, and the potential for disparities in healthcare access.  Finally, future directions in the field, such as liquid biopsies and the integration of multi-omics data, will be highlighted.
