Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field.  This lecture explores key challenges, focusing on three core areas. Firstly, the allocation of scarce organs necessitates a just and equitable system, moving beyond simple criteria like waiting-time to incorporate factors such as urgency and prognosis, while avoiding discriminatory practices.  Secondly, informed consent, central to transplantation, requires careful consideration of patient capacity, particularly in cases of urgent transplantation or diminished cognitive function.  The potential for coercion, either implicit or explicit, must be rigorously addressed.  Thirdly, the growing field of living donation raises complex issues related to altruism, potential exploitation, and the appropriate level of risk assessment and psychological evaluation for donors.  Balancing the potential benefits for recipients with the risks to donors demands a robust ethical framework, grounded in respect for persons and justice.  Future research should focus on developing and implementing transparent and ethically justifiable allocation algorithms, enhancing informed consent processes, and refining guidelines for living donation to ensure the ethical integrity of this life-saving procedure.
