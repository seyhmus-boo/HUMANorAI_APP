Cancer, a leading cause of mortality globally, is a complex disease driven by a multitude of genetic and epigenetic alterations.  While traditional cancer therapies target broad cellular mechanisms, advances in understanding the genetic basis of cancer have paved the way for personalized medicine approaches. This research paper reviews the significant progress made in identifying cancer-associated genetic mutations and their impact on disease progression and treatment response. We examine the role of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in characterizing the unique genomic profiles of individual tumors, enabling the identification of driver mutations and biomarkers predictive of therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, we discuss the application of this genomic information in tailoring treatment strategies, including targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and novel drug development.  The challenges associated with implementing personalized oncology, such as cost-effectiveness, accessibility, and ethical considerations, are also explored.  Finally, we discuss the future directions of this rapidly evolving field, highlighting the potential of integrating multi-omics data, artificial intelligence, and liquid biopsies to further refine personalized cancer treatment paradigms and ultimately improve patient outcomes.
