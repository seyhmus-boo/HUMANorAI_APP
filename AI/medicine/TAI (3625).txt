Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and multifaceted field demanding ongoing scrutiny.  This review examines key ethical dilemmas inherent in the process, focusing on three core areas: equitable allocation of scarce resources, informed consent and the vulnerability of potential donors, and the potential for coercion and exploitation.  The current system, often employing points-based allocation criteria, faces criticism for its potential biases and inherent inequalities, particularly concerning socioeconomic disparities and geographical access.  Furthermore, ensuring truly informed consent from living donors, particularly within familial contexts, presents a significant challenge, requiring careful attention to potential pressures and undue influence.  The commercialization of organs, though largely prohibited, continues to raise ethical concerns, necessitating robust regulatory frameworks and international collaboration to combat organ trafficking and exploitation.  Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating bioethics, law, and social science perspectives to develop more just and equitable organ allocation systems that prioritize patient autonomy and safeguard vulnerable populations.  Future research should focus on developing more transparent and accountable processes, minimizing disparities, and promoting global cooperation to improve ethical practices in organ transplantation.
