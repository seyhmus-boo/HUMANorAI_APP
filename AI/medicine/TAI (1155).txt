Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  Recent research increasingly emphasizes the non-linear and cascading effects of a warming planet on human well-being.  Beyond well-established impacts like increased heat-related mortality and the expansion of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever,  new studies highlight emerging challenges.  For example, the increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, including floods and wildfires, lead not only to direct injuries and fatalities but also to displacement, mental health issues, and disruptions to healthcare infrastructure, impacting access to essential services.  Furthermore, the changing climate is exacerbating existing health inequalities, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations with limited adaptive capacity, such as the elderly, impoverished communities, and those in low-lying coastal regions.  Recent modelling studies offer increasingly sophisticated predictions regarding the future burden of climate-sensitive diseases, highlighting the need for proactive and integrated strategies that encompass mitigation efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation measures aimed at strengthening public health systems' resilience to climate change impacts.  The integration of climate considerations into public health planning and policy is thus paramount for safeguarding global health in the face of this escalating threat.
