The rise of antibiotic resistance presents a significant global health crisis, threatening the efficacy of treatments for bacterial infections.  Historically, the discovery of penicillin in the 1920s heralded a new era in medicine, effectively combating previously lethal diseases.  However, the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics since then has inadvertently driven the selection and proliferation of resistant strains.  This evolutionary pressure, favouring bacteria capable of surviving antibiotic exposure, has resulted in the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens.

The global implications are profound.  Previously treatable infections, such as pneumonia and tuberculosis, are becoming increasingly difficult, if not impossible, to manage.  This leads to increased morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and escalating healthcare costs. The impact extends beyond human health, affecting agricultural practices reliant on antibiotics and potentially impacting food security.  Addressing this challenge requires a multi-pronged approach, including responsible antibiotic stewardship, investment in novel antibiotic development, and the implementation of effective infection control strategies. The continued failure to do so will undoubtedly lead to a post-antibiotic era with devastating consequences.
