Antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria to withstand antimicrobial treatment, poses a significant global threat demanding an interdisciplinary response.  Its emergence stems from the complex interplay of evolutionary biology, where bacterial adaptation is driven by selective pressure from antibiotic overuse and misuse in human and veterinary medicine, and agriculture.  This necessitates collaboration between microbiologists, who study the mechanisms of resistance, and epidemiologists, who track its spread through populations.  Furthermore, the economic implications, including increased healthcare costs and productivity losses, require input from economists and policymakers.  Addressing the social determinants, such as access to healthcare and sanitation, requires collaboration with sociologists and public health specialists.  Finally, chemists and pharmaceutical scientists are crucial in the development of novel antimicrobial agents and strategies to circumvent resistance.  In essence, combating this global health crisis demands a holistic and collaborative approach spanning multiple scientific disciplines and societal sectors.  Failure to achieve this interdisciplinary synergy will have profound and potentially catastrophic global consequences.
