Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgery, transitioning from initial laparoscopic approaches to sophisticated robotic and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) methods.  This evolution has been driven by the pursuit of reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved patient outcomes.  Early laparoscopic procedures, while significantly less invasive than open surgery, were limited by dexterity and visualization challenges.  The introduction of robotic surgery addressed these limitations, providing enhanced precision, dexterity, and 3D visualization.  Simultaneously, NOTES aimed to eliminate external incisions entirely, utilizing natural orifices as access points.  However, technological and anatomical limitations have hindered the widespread adoption of NOTES.  Recent advancements focus on improving ergonomics, incorporating augmented reality and artificial intelligence (AI) for enhanced precision and training, and developing novel instrumentation for improved access and manipulation during MIS procedures.  Further research is crucial to refine existing techniques, address limitations, and expand the applicability of MIS across a wider range of surgical specialties, ultimately optimizing patient care and minimizing surgical morbidity.  The future trajectory suggests a convergence of robotic, AI-assisted, and potentially NOTES approaches, ushering in an era of increasingly personalized and precise minimally invasive surgery.
