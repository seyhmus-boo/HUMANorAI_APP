Climate change, driven primarily by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health. While the scientific understanding of climate change has evolved considerably since the initial observations of rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the late 19th century, the implications for human health have only recently begun to receive commensurate attention.  Early research focused predominantly on the direct impacts of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and floods, on morbidity and mortality.  However, the scope of climate change's health consequences is now recognized to extend far beyond these acute effects.  This paper explores the complex and evolving relationship between climate change and public health, encompassing both direct impacts such as increased infectious disease transmission and the exacerbation of existing health inequalities, and indirect consequences, including mental health impacts and disruptions to healthcare systems.  We will analyze the historical trajectory of this understanding, from early epidemiological studies to the current, more nuanced, integrated models incorporating the interconnectedness of environmental, social, and health determinants.  Ultimately, this research seeks to illuminate the urgent need for comprehensive and integrated strategies to mitigate climate change and build climate-resilient health systems.
