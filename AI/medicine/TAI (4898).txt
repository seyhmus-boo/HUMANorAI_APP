Organ transplantation, a life-saving medical marvel, presents complex ethical dilemmas rooted in its historical context. Early transplants, often conducted with limited success and questionable consent, highlighted the need for robust ethical frameworks.  The initial focus was on procuring organs, raising concerns about donor exploitation and the potential for coercion, particularly involving vulnerable populations.  The development of brain-death criteria, while resolving some issues, introduced new debates about the definition of death and the moral permissibility of harvesting organs from individuals deemed "brain dead."

Contemporary ethical considerations extend beyond procurement to equitable allocation.  Just distribution amongst a vast pool of potential recipients demands transparent and impartial criteria, challenging notions of merit and deservingness.  Furthermore, the high cost of transplantation exacerbates existing healthcare inequalities, raising questions of access and justice.  Finally, the potential for organ trafficking and the commodification of the human body remain significant threats, necessitating stringent regulatory oversight and international cooperation to ensure ethical practices and protect vulnerable individuals.
