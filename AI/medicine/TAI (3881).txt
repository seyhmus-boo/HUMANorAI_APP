Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has undergone significant evolution since its nascent stages in the late 20th century. Initially limited by technological constraints and bandwidth issues, primarily serving remote or underserved populations, telemedicine now leverages sophisticated technologies such as high-speed internet, mobile devices, and wearable sensors. This technological advancement has broadened its applications across various healthcare settings, from routine consultations and chronic disease management to specialist referrals and surgical guidance.  This abstract examines the expanding role of telemedicine in modern healthcare delivery.  Studies demonstrate its effectiveness in improving access to care, enhancing patient convenience, and reducing healthcare costs, particularly for patients in geographically isolated areas or with mobility limitations. However, challenges remain, including concerns about data security, regulatory frameworks, reimbursement models, and the digital divide, which limits equitable access. Future research should focus on addressing these limitations to maximize telemedicine's potential to optimize healthcare delivery, improve patient outcomes, and enhance overall healthcare system efficiency.  Integrating robust cybersecurity measures and ensuring equitable access across socioeconomic strata are crucial for realizing telemedicine's full transformative impact.
