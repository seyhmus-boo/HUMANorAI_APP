The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Early research, focusing on chromosomal abnormalities like the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), laid the foundation for recognizing cancer as a disease driven by genetic alterations.  These initial discoveries were followed by the identification of oncogenes, genes whose activation contributes to uncontrolled cell growth, and tumor suppressor genes, whose inactivation facilitates tumorigenesis.  Technological advancements, particularly next-generation sequencing (NGS), have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, revealing the complex landscape of somatic mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic modifications driving individual cancers. This wealth of genomic data has facilitated the development of targeted therapies, designed to specifically inhibit the products of mutated genes or pathways crucial for tumor growth.  For instance, the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in CML exemplifies the power of targeting specific oncogenic drivers.  However, challenges remain, including the heterogeneity of tumors, the emergence of drug resistance due to further mutations, and the ethical considerations surrounding access to expensive personalized treatments.  Ongoing research focuses on refining genomic profiling techniques, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and developing predictive biomarkers to optimize treatment selection and improve patient outcomes within the framework of personalized cancer care.
