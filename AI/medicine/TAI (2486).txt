Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the genetic underpinnings of cancer and their implications for personalized medicine.  Think of the human genome as a complex instruction manual for building and maintaining the body. Cancer arises from errors – mutations – in this manual, leading to uncontrolled cell growth.  These mutations are akin to typos in the instructions, some minor, others catastrophic.  

Historically, cancer treatment has been a blunt instrument, akin to using a sledgehammer to fix a specific faulty screw.  Advances in genomics, however, allow us to pinpoint the precise "typos" driving individual cancers. This is akin to using a precision screwdriver. Next-generation sequencing identifies specific genetic alterations, such as oncogene activation or tumour suppressor gene inactivation, unique to a patient's tumour.  This information informs the selection of targeted therapies, like drugs designed to precisely correct the "typo" or disable its effects.  Therefore, personalized medicine moves us away from a one-size-fits-all approach to cancer treatment, enabling more effective, less toxic interventions tailored to an individual's unique genetic profile, ultimately improving patient outcomes.
