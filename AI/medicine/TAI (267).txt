This presentation addresses the ongoing experimental challenges in translating advancements in cancer genetics into effective personalized medicine. While genomic sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of cancer's heterogeneous nature, translating this knowledge into clinically actionable therapies remains a significant hurdle.  We will discuss the limitations of current genomic profiling techniques, particularly regarding the detection of low-frequency mutations and the complexities of interpreting complex genomic rearrangements and epigenetic modifications.  Furthermore, the establishment of robust pre-clinical models that accurately reflect the inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity poses a significant challenge in drug development and efficacy prediction.  We will highlight the difficulties in validating novel therapeutic targets identified through genomic analysis, including the limitations of in vitro and in vivo models and the need for more sophisticated approaches to assess drug response. Finally, we will explore the ethical and practical challenges associated with the implementation of personalized medicine, including issues of data privacy, cost-effectiveness, and access for all patients.  Addressing these experimental and logistical obstacles is crucial for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer therapies.
