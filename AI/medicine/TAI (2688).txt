This presentation examines evolving trends in adolescent mental health disorders and their contemporary treatments.  Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with issues frequently misdiagnosed or attributed to typical teenage angst.  However,  increasing awareness and improved diagnostic tools have revealed a concerning rise in conditions such as anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviours in recent decades.  This upward trend is likely influenced by a complex interplay of societal factors, including increased academic pressure, social media usage, and the impact of global events.

The presentation will explore these contributing factors, highlighting disparities in access to care and the varying efficacy of current treatment approaches.  We will review evidence-based interventions, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), medication management, and family-based therapies, emphasizing the importance of tailored interventions based on individual needs and severity of symptoms.  Furthermore, the abstract will discuss emerging trends in digital mental health interventions and their potential role in improving accessibility and engagement among adolescents. Finally, we will briefly address the urgent need for preventative strategies, fostering resilience and early intervention programs to mitigate the escalating mental health crisis amongst young people.
