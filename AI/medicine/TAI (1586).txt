Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents complex ethical dilemmas.  This abstract highlights key contemporary challenges.  A persistent issue is the critical shortage of donor organs, leading to difficult allocation decisions.  Recent advancements in computational modeling and machine learning offer potential for fairer and more efficient allocation algorithms, but raise concerns about algorithmic bias and transparency.  Furthermore, the expansion of living donor transplantation, while increasing organ availability, introduces ethical considerations surrounding coercion and the potential for exploitation of vulnerable populations.  The rise of xenotransplantation introduces new ethical dimensions, including the risk of zoonotic disease transmission and the ethical status of animals used as donors.  Debates surrounding informed consent, particularly in cases involving minors or individuals with diminished capacity, remain prominent.  Finally, the increasing cost of transplantation raises concerns about equitable access, creating disparities based on socioeconomic status.  Addressing these complex issues requires ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue involving ethicists, clinicians, policymakers, and the public to ensure that organ transplantation remains a just and equitable system.
