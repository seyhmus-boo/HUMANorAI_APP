Cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, transitioning from a largely descriptive field to one of precision medicine. Early understandings, exemplified by the Philadelphia chromosome's discovery in chronic myeloid leukemia, revealed specific chromosomal abnormalities driving malignancy.  This paved the way for targeted therapies like imatinib.  Subsequent advancements in genomics, particularly next-generation sequencing, have unveiled the intricate landscape of somatic mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic alterations contributing to cancer development and progression.  This wealth of data allows for the identification of driver mutations unique to an individual's tumour, enabling personalized approaches.

Advances in personalized medicine now leverage genomic profiling to select patients most likely to benefit from specific targeted therapies, overcoming the limitations of broad-spectrum chemotherapies.  Furthermore, understanding tumour heterogeneity through spatial and single-cell sequencing informs the development of combinatorial therapies addressing multiple driver mutations simultaneously.  While challenges remain in interpreting complex genomic data and addressing treatment resistance, the integration of genomics into clinical practice promises increasingly effective and tailored cancer treatments, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.
