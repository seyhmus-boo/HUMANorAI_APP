Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting notable trends in recent decades.  Increases in anxiety and depression diagnoses are particularly pronounced, potentially linked to societal factors such as increased academic pressure, social media usage, and climate anxiety.  Furthermore, emerging evidence suggests a rise in self-harm behaviors and eating disorders among this population.  Treatment approaches are evolving to address these trends. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) remain cornerstones of effective interventions, often coupled with family-based therapy to engage the broader support system.  Pharmacological interventions, while considered alongside other therapies, are carefully chosen and monitored due to potential long-term effects.  The integration of technology, such as telehealth platforms and mobile applications, offers promising avenues for accessibility and engagement, particularly in addressing stigma and facilitating timely intervention.  Further research is critical to elucidate the interplay between environmental factors and biological predispositions to refine preventative strategies and personalize treatment plans.
