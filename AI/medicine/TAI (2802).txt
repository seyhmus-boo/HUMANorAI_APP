Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), a paradigm shift in surgical practice, has undergone remarkable evolution since its nascent stages.  Early attempts, primarily focused on endoscopy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were limited by rudimentary instrumentation and a lack of real-time visualization.  The development of laparoscopy in the mid-20th century, initially employing rigid endoscopes and limited maneuverability, represented a significant advancement.  However, the true revolution began with the advent of fibre optics, enabling improved visualization and dexterity.  Subsequent breakthroughs included the development of smaller incisions, refined instrumentation, including articulated endoscopes and energy sources, and the integration of advanced imaging technologies like ultrasound and 3D visualization.  Robotics, introduced more recently, has further enhanced precision and control, allowing for complex procedures with enhanced dexterity and reduced trauma.  Ongoing research continues to explore areas such as single-port surgery and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), aiming for even smaller incisions and improved patient outcomes.  Despite advancements, challenges remain concerning training, cost-effectiveness, and appropriate patient selection for MIS techniques.  Nevertheless, the trajectory of MIS evolution points toward a future of even less invasive and more precise surgical interventions.
