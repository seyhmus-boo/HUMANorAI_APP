Historically, adolescent mental health disorders were often overlooked, attributed to typical teenage angst, or pathologized through a deficit lens.  However, recent decades have witnessed a significant shift, with rising prevalence rates reported across various disorders, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. This increase may be attributed to complex interplay of factors: societal pressures, increased academic competition, social media influence, and potentially improved diagnostic capabilities.  

Treatment approaches have also evolved. While traditional psychotherapeutic modalities like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy remain prominent, there's a growing emphasis on integrating evidence-based interventions tailored to the developmental stage.  Pharmacotherapy, although controversial, plays a role in managing severe symptoms, particularly for conditions like depression and bipolar disorder.  Furthermore, family-based therapies and peer support groups acknowledge the crucial influence of social context on adolescent mental wellbeing.  Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies to understand the long-term trajectory of these disorders and to develop more effective and accessible interventions for this vulnerable population.
