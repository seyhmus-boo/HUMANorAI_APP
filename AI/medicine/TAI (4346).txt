Cancer's genetic underpinnings are increasingly central to personalized medicine, demanding an interdisciplinary approach.  Advances in genomics, particularly next-generation sequencing, have revolutionized our understanding of oncogenesis.  We now appreciate the heterogeneous nature of cancer, recognizing diverse driver mutations across different tumour types and even within individual tumours.  This knowledge fuels the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, specifically designed to counteract oncogenic mutations.  However, the success of these therapies hinges on accurate genomic profiling, requiring bioinformaticians to interpret complex data sets and collaborate with oncologists to select optimal treatment strategies.  Furthermore, the burgeoning field of immunooncology relies on understanding tumour-associated antigens and the immune system's response, linking immunology and genetics.  Ultimately, progress in personalized cancer medicine depends on seamless collaboration between geneticists, bioinformaticians, oncologists, immunologists, and other specialists, leading to more effective and less toxic cancer treatments.
