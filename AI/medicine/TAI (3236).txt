Cancer, a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cellular proliferation, remains a significant global health challenge.  While traditional cancer treatments offer some efficacy, their broad-spectrum approach often results in significant side effects and limited success rates for many patients.  The burgeoning field of personalized medicine, driven by advancements in genomics and molecular biology, offers a paradigm shift in cancer treatment, moving away from one-size-fits-all strategies towards tailored therapies based on an individual's unique genetic profile. This research paper explores the pivotal role of genetic factors in cancer development and progression, focusing on the significant strides made in identifying key driver mutations and characterizing distinct cancer subtypes at the molecular level.  We will examine how this enhanced understanding of the genetic basis of cancer is translating into practical applications, including targeted therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy,  the development of predictive biomarkers for treatment response and recurrence, and the refinement of risk stratification strategies for early detection and prevention. Ultimately, this review aims to illuminate the current state and future potential of personalized medicine in revolutionizing cancer care and improving patient outcomes.
