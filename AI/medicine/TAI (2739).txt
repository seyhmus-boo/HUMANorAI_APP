Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transition, is characterized by heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders (MHDs).  This paper examines emerging trends in the prevalence and presentation of MHDs among adolescents, focusing on key disorders such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders.  We analyze existing epidemiological data to highlight shifts in diagnostic rates, symptom profiles, and potential contributing factors, including the influence of social media, academic pressures, and societal changes.  Furthermore, we critically evaluate the efficacy and accessibility of current treatment modalities, including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy (specifically Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy), and integrated approaches.  The review underscores the critical need for early intervention and preventative strategies, addressing limitations in current service provision and highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach involving families, educators, and healthcare professionals.  Ultimately, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the evolving landscape of adolescent MHDs, informing future research directions and the development of more effective and accessible interventions.
