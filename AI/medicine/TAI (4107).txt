Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has rapidly expanded its role in modern healthcare delivery. While offering significant potential for improved access, reduced costs, and enhanced patient outcomes, its widespread implementation faces substantial experimental challenges. This paper explores these critical limitations, moving beyond simple adoption barriers to focus on the methodological difficulties inherent in rigorous evaluation.  Specifically, we address the complexities of establishing causality in telemedicine interventions, particularly in disentangling the effects of the technology itself from other concurrent factors influencing patient care.  The challenges of controlling for selection bias, where patients opting for telemedicine differ systematically from those receiving in-person care, are central to our discussion.  Furthermore, the development of standardized outcome measures and the difficulties in ensuring data quality and security across diverse technological platforms are key obstacles to generating robust evidence of telemedicineâ€™s efficacy.  By examining these experimental challenges, this research aims to highlight critical areas requiring further methodological refinement to support the responsible and effective integration of telemedicine into healthcare systems globally.
