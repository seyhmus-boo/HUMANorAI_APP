Organ transplantation, while offering a life-saving intervention, presents complex ethical dilemmas.  A central issue revolves around the allocation of scarce organs, necessitating equitable distribution systems.  Utilitarian approaches prioritize maximizing overall benefit, potentially leading to prioritization based on factors such as age or prognosis.  Conversely, egalitarian principles advocate for equal access regardless of social standing, raising questions about resource fairness.  The concept of distributive justice is paramount here, demanding transparent and justifiable criteria to avoid discrimination.

Further ethical concerns encompass informed consent and the potential for coercion, particularly from vulnerable populations.  The definition of death, especially brain death, remains a subject of ongoing debate and impacts organ procurement practices.  Finally, the commercialization of organs raises serious ethical questions regarding exploitation and the commodification of human body parts, necessitating robust legal frameworks to prevent organ trafficking and safeguard donor autonomy.  Practical applications involve developing transparent allocation algorithms, strengthening regulations against coercion, and promoting public education to enhance organ donation awareness and alleviate anxieties surrounding the process.
