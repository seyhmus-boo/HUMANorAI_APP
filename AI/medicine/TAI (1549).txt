Adolescent mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and substance use, are exhibiting concerning upward trends globally, influenced by complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors.  Neurobiological vulnerabilities interact with stressful life events, peer pressure, and societal pressures impacting academic performance and identity formation, increasing susceptibility.  Effective treatment requires an interdisciplinary approach.  Psychiatrists provide medication management, addressing biological underpinnings, while psychologists utilize evidence-based therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) targeting maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors.  Social workers address systemic factors such as family dynamics and school environment, facilitating supportive networks.  Furthermore, collaboration with educators is crucial for early identification, intervention, and fostering inclusive school climates.  This integrated model recognizes the multifaceted nature of adolescent mental health, improving outcomes by synergistically addressing individual needs within their broader social context.  Future research should focus on refining these interdisciplinary collaborations and developing preventative strategies targeting risk factors at multiple levels.
