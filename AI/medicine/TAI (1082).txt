Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, demanding urgent attention. This review summarizes the multifaceted nature of AR, highlighting its origins in the overuse and misuse of antibiotics across human and animal health sectors, coupled with inadequate infection control practices.  The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, including Gram-negative bacteria and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, presents particularly challenging clinical scenarios, limiting treatment options and increasing morbidity and mortality.  The economic burden of AR is substantial, encompassing healthcare costs, lost productivity, and the potential for widespread societal disruption.  Effective strategies to combat AR require a multi-pronged approach, including stewardship programs promoting judicious antibiotic use, investment in novel antibiotic development and alternative therapies, such as phage therapy and vaccines, and improvements in sanitation and hygiene. International collaboration, surveillance systems, and robust regulatory frameworks are crucial for mitigating the global spread of resistant pathogens and ensuring sustainable healthcare systems.  Further research focusing on innovative diagnostic tools and personalized medicine approaches is urgently needed to address this complex and growing challenge.
