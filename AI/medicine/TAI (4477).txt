Adolescents experience a disproportionately high burden of mental health disorders, with rising prevalence rates observed globally in recent years.  This increase necessitates a comprehensive understanding of evolving trends and effective treatment strategies.  Anxiety disorders and depression remain prevalent, but  a concerning rise in self-harm and suicidal ideation is demanding urgent attention.  Factors contributing to this rise include societal pressures, increased screen time, and the impact of global events.  Treatment approaches are evolving beyond traditional methods.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and other evidence-based psychotherapies remain cornerstones, increasingly delivered via digital platforms, expanding access and addressing stigma.  Pharmacological interventions, while effective for some, are often used cautiously in adolescents due to potential long-term effects and require careful monitoring.  A growing emphasis is placed on integrated care models, combining psychotherapy, medication, and family-based interventions to address the multifaceted nature of adolescent mental health.  Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effectiveness of emerging digital interventions and to identify preventative strategies targeting modifiable risk factors.  Early identification and intervention remain crucial in improving outcomes and reducing the significant morbidity associated with these disorders.
