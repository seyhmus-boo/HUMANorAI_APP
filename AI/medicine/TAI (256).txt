Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving area, demanding careful scrutiny. This review summarizes key ethical dilemmas arising throughout the transplantation process, from organ procurement to allocation and post-transplant care.  The scarcity of organs necessitates robust and equitable allocation systems, sparking debates regarding criteria prioritization (e.g., medical urgency vs. social worth).  Concerns surrounding informed consent, particularly in vulnerable populations or with deceased donors, require ongoing attention.  Furthermore, the potential for coercion, exploitation, and disparities in access based on socioeconomic factors necessitates critical analysis.  The financial implications, including the high costs of transplantation and potential for organ trafficking, pose significant ethical challenges.  Finally, the psychological and social impacts on both recipients and donor families underscore the need for comprehensive ethical frameworks that prioritize patient well-being and social justice.  Future research should focus on developing more transparent and equitable allocation policies, strengthening safeguards against exploitation, and enhancing support systems for all stakeholders involved in this life-saving yet ethically complex field.
