Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding ongoing scrutiny and refinement of practice.  This presentation explores key ethical dilemmas arising at various stages of the transplantation process, from donor identification and consent to allocation and post-transplant care.  We will examine the tension between the principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice, particularly in contexts of scarce resources and diverse cultural perspectives regarding death and bodily autonomy.  Specific focus will be given to the ethical implications of expanding donor pools, including the use of marginal organs and donation after circulatory death (DCD).  The presentation will further analyse the challenges of equitable organ allocation systems, addressing issues of fairness, transparency, and potential biases in prioritization criteria.  Practical applications discussed will include strategies for improving informed consent procedures, developing more transparent allocation algorithms, and fostering trust among patients, families, and healthcare professionals.  Ultimately, this presentation aims to stimulate dialogue and contribute to a more ethically robust and equitable approach to organ transplantation.
