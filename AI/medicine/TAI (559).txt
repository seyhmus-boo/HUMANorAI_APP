Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery times, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This paper examines the significant evolution of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, tracing its development from early rudimentary approaches to the sophisticated technologies employed today.  Early pioneers, while lacking the advanced instrumentation of the modern era, laid the crucial groundwork.  The development of the endoscope in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, initially used for diagnostic purposes, marked a pivotal moment, enabling visualization of internal structures through small incisions.  However, the limitations of early endoscopes and the challenges of manipulating instruments within confined spaces hindered widespread adoption.  Subsequent advancements, including the development of laparoscopy in the mid-20th century and the refinement of specialized instruments, dramatically improved precision and dexterity.  This paper will analyze the key technological innovations, such as the introduction of robotic surgery and advanced imaging modalities, which have further propelled the evolution of MIS techniques.  Finally, we will consider ongoing research and future directions in the field, exploring the potential of artificial intelligence and personalized surgery in shaping the next generation of minimally invasive procedures.
