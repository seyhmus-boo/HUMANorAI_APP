Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding ongoing scrutiny. This presentation examines key ethical dilemmas arising throughout the transplantation process, from organ procurement to allocation and post-transplant care.  We will explore the tension between the utilitarian imperative to maximize the number of successful transplants and the deontological requirement to respect individual autonomy and protect vulnerable populations.  The presentation will critically analyze the current systems of organ allocation, highlighting potential biases and inequalities based on factors such as socioeconomic status, race, and geographical location.  Furthermore, we will address the ethical challenges surrounding informed consent, particularly in cases involving deceased donors and individuals with diminished capacity. The debate around the use of living donors, including potential coercion and the implications for family dynamics, will also be considered. Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss emerging technologies, such as xenotransplantation and 3D-printed organs, and their associated ethical implications, arguing for a robust and adaptable ethical framework to guide future practice and policy within the field of organ transplantation.
