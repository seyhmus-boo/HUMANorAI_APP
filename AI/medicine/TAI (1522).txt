This presentation addresses the evolving landscape of mental health disorders in adolescents, highlighting key trends and the experimental challenges in their effective treatment.  Recent epidemiological data reveals a concerning rise in anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviours, particularly amongst vulnerable subgroups.  While established treatments exist, their efficacy varies widely, necessitating a focus on personalized interventions.  This necessitates overcoming several experimental challenges. Firstly, the heterogeneity of adolescent mental health presentations complicates the development of universally effective therapies.  Secondly,  the rapidly changing neurobiological landscape of adolescence poses difficulties in establishing reliable biomarkers for diagnosis and treatment monitoring.  Thirdly, ethical considerations surrounding experimental interventions in vulnerable populations require careful navigation, balancing potential benefits against risks.  This presentation will discuss innovative approaches to address these challenges, including advancements in neuroimaging, personalized medicine strategies leveraging genetic and environmental factors, and the ethical frameworks guiding clinical trials in adolescent mental health research.  Ultimately, we aim to illuminate the crucial need for rigorous, ethically sound experimental designs to improve outcomes for this vulnerable population.
