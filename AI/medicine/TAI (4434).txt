Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have undergone a dramatic evolution since their inception, significantly impacting patient outcomes and healthcare delivery. This review summarizes key advancements, focusing on technological and procedural refinements. Early MIS relied on rigid endoscopes and limited instrumentation, resulting in constrained dexterity and visualization.  Subsequent development of flexible endoscopes, laparoscopic instruments with enhanced articulation, and robotic-assisted surgery expanded procedural capabilities and precision.  The integration of advanced imaging modalities, such as 3D laparoscopy and intraoperative fluorescence imaging, improved surgical visualization and tissue identification.  Simultaneously, energy sources transitioned from monopolar electrocautery to advanced techniques like bipolar coagulation, ultrasonic dissection, and laser surgery, minimizing thermal injury and improving hemostasis.  The adoption of single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) further minimized invasiveness.  Despite considerable progress, challenges remain, including the learning curve associated with advanced techniques, limitations in tactile feedback, and the cost of specialized equipment. Ongoing research focuses on artificial intelligence integration, augmented reality applications, and further miniaturization to optimize MIS and broaden its applications.  Future directions will likely prioritize personalized surgery guided by advanced imaging and data analytics, ultimately improving patient safety and surgical efficacy.
