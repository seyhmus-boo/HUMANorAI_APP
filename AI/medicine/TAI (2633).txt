This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and the climate change-public health nexus. While seemingly disparate, we argue that a quantum mechanical framework offers novel insights beyond classical approaches.  We propose that the complex, interconnected systems driving climate change and its health impacts – encompassing atmospheric chemistry, ecosystem dynamics, and disease vector behavior – can be more accurately modeled using quantum-inspired computational methods.  Specifically, we will examine the potential of quantum algorithms to analyze high-dimensional climate data and predict the spatiotemporal distribution of climate-sensitive diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever.  Furthermore, we will discuss the application of quantum machine learning for identifying vulnerable populations and optimizing public health interventions based on predicted climate impacts.  By leveraging the power of quantum superposition and entanglement, we aim to enhance predictive accuracy and develop more effective strategies for mitigating the escalating health risks associated with climate change. This approach offers a potential paradigm shift in understanding and addressing this critical global challenge, moving beyond correlation to a deeper, mechanistic understanding of the underlying processes.  Limitations and future research directions will also be discussed.
