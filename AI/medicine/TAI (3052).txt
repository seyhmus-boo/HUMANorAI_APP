The genetic basis of cancer is increasingly understood, fueling advancements in personalized medicine. This presentation will explore recent breakthroughs impacting cancer diagnosis and treatment.  Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to identify somatic mutations, copy number variations, and gene fusions driving tumorigenesis, enabling more precise subtyping and prognostication.  The identification of actionable mutations, particularly within pathways like PI3K/AKT/mTOR and RAS/RAF/MAPK, facilitates the selection of targeted therapies, maximizing efficacy and minimizing adverse effects.  Furthermore, the burgeoning field of immunotherapy leverages our understanding of tumor immunology and the genetic landscape to develop immune checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T-cell therapies, offering remarkable success in specific cancer types.  Recent advances in liquid biopsies provide minimally invasive methods for monitoring disease progression and response to therapy, improving patient management.  However, challenges remain, including the complexity of the cancer genome, inter-tumoral heterogeneity, and the development of resistance mechanisms. This presentation will discuss these challenges alongside promising areas of ongoing research, such as the integration of multi-omics data and the development of artificial intelligence-driven approaches for personalized cancer care.
