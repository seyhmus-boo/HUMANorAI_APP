This presentation will explore the ongoing experimental challenges in translating advancements in cancer genetics into effective personalized medicine.  While genomic sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of cancer's heterogeneity, translating this knowledge into tailored therapies faces significant hurdles.  We will discuss the complexities of identifying driver mutations amidst passenger variations, highlighting the limitations of current bioinformatic tools in discerning clinically relevant alterations.  Furthermore,  the development of robust preclinical models that accurately reflect the intricate tumor microenvironment and its interaction with the host immune system remains a major obstacle.  The challenges of translating in vitro and in vivo findings to clinical trials will be addressed, focusing on issues of patient stratification,  drug delivery, and the potential for acquired resistance. We will also examine the ethical considerations surrounding the accessibility and affordability of personalized cancer therapies, emphasizing the need for equitable access to these potentially life-saving advancements.  Finally, we will briefly discuss future directions, including the potential of CRISPR-based technologies and liquid biopsies to overcome current limitations and accelerate progress towards truly personalized cancer care.
