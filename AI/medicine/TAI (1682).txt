Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant global public health concern, with increasing prevalence documented over recent decades. Historically, adolescent mental health received limited attention, often conflated with typical developmental challenges.  However, improved diagnostic tools and increased awareness have revealed rising rates of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders among this population.  This rise is likely multifactorial, influenced by societal changes, including increased academic pressure, social media usage, and exposure to trauma. Treatment approaches have also evolved, moving beyond traditional psychoanalytic methods to encompass evidence-based interventions like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and pharmacotherapy, tailored to specific disorders and developmental stages.  Challenges remain, however, including access to timely and appropriate care, particularly in underserved communities.  Future research needs to focus on refining preventative strategies, optimizing existing treatments through personalized approaches, and addressing systemic inequalities that exacerbate mental health disparities among adolescents.  A greater understanding of the interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors is critical to mitigating the burgeoning burden of adolescent mental health disorders.
