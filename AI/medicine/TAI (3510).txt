Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the inextricable link between climate change and public health.  Think of the Earth's climate system as a finely balanced ecosystem: a complex web of interconnected components.  Climate change acts as a disruptive force, pulling at those threads, causing cascading effects on human health.

Rising temperatures, analogous to raising the thermostat in a greenhouse, increase the incidence of heatstroke and exacerbate cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses.  Extreme weather events, like hurricanes, are akin to powerful waves crashing against a coastal community, causing injury, displacement, and mental health issues in their wake.  Changes in precipitation patterns, like a disrupted irrigation system, affect food security and nutrition, leading to malnutrition and infectious disease outbreaks.  Furthermore, the spread of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria, mimics the expansion of a colony of insects finding new, hospitable territories due to changing temperatures and rainfall.  Therefore, addressing climate change is not merely an environmental concern, but a fundamental public health imperative.
