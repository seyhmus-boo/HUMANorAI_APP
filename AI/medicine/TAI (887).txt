Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of surgical techniques in MIS, highlighting key technological advancements and their impact on surgical approaches.  Early pioneers, utilizing rudimentary endoscopes and limited instrumentation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, laid the groundwork for modern MIS.  The introduction of laparoscopy in the mid-20th century marked a significant turning point, initially restricted to diagnostic procedures but rapidly expanding to encompass a broader range of surgical interventions.

Subsequent decades witnessed exponential growth, fueled by innovations including improved optics, smaller instruments, energy sources (e.g., lasers, ultrasound), and advanced imaging technologies.  Robotic-assisted surgery, introduced in the late 20th century, further refined precision and dexterity, extending the possibilities of MIS into complex procedures previously considered unsuitable.  This presentation will analyze the transition from traditional open surgery to increasingly sophisticated MIS techniques, discussing the challenges encountered and the ongoing evolution driven by advancements in areas such as single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES). Finally, we will consider future directions, focusing on artificial intelligence and augmented reality applications poised to further refine and personalize minimally invasive surgical approaches.
