Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising diagnostic capabilities within healthcare, offering significant improvements in speed, accuracy, and accessibility.  Its impact stems from the ability of AI algorithms to analyse vast datasets, identifying patterns imperceptible to the human eye.  Practical applications are numerous.  In radiology, AI-powered systems assist in detecting anomalies in medical images such as X-rays and MRIs, flagging potential cancers or fractures for radiologist review, thus enhancing diagnostic sensitivity and reducing human error.  Similarly, in pathology, AI algorithms are being deployed to analyse tissue samples, aiding in the identification of cancerous cells and improving the accuracy of disease classification.  Furthermore, AI-driven diagnostic tools are expanding access to care in underserved regions through telemedicine platforms, offering preliminary diagnoses based on readily available data such as patient history and images.  However, ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and the need for human oversight remain crucial areas of ongoing research and development.
