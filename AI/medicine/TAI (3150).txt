Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health. This abstract highlights the critical interdisciplinary links necessary to understand and address this complex relationship.  Rising temperatures exacerbate existing health inequalities, increasing heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to waterborne disease outbreaks and malnutrition through impacts on agricultural yields.  Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, are expanding their geographical range due to altered climate conditions, necessitating integrated epidemiological and ecological modelling.  Furthermore, extreme weather events, including floods, droughts, and wildfires, cause direct injury and displacement, leading to mental health challenges and infectious disease transmission.  Addressing this necessitates collaboration across disciplines including climatology, epidemiology, public health, social sciences, and economics.  Integrated approaches, encompassing climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies, are vital to protect vulnerable populations and build resilient healthcare systems capable of responding to the evolving health impacts of a changing climate.  Further research is needed to refine predictive models and develop targeted interventions to minimize the detrimental consequences on global health.
