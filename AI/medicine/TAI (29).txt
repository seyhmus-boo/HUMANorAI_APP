Climate change, driven primarily by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  While the immediate impacts of extreme weather events—heatwaves, floods, and droughts—are readily apparent, the relationship between climate change and public health extends far beyond these acute manifestations.  Historically, the connection between environmental factors and disease has been understood since antiquity, with Hippocrates recognizing the influence of climate on health. However, the scale and intensity of climate-related health impacts are unprecedented in the contemporary era, demanding urgent attention from the scientific and public health communities. This research paper examines the complex interplay between climate change and various public health outcomes.  We will explore the direct effects, such as increased mortality from heat stress and the expansion of vector-borne diseases, as well as indirect impacts like malnutrition exacerbated by crop failures and mental health challenges arising from displacement and environmental degradation.  Furthermore, the paper will investigate the disparities in vulnerability to climate-related health risks based on socioeconomic status, geographical location, and pre-existing health conditions, highlighting the need for equitable and effective adaptation strategies.  Ultimately, this work aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of this critical nexus, informing policy development and intervention strategies for mitigating the escalating health burdens of a changing climate.
