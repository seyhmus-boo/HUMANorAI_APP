Telemedicine's integration into modern healthcare delivery has demonstrably reshaped access to and delivery of care. This review examines its multifaceted role, encompassing both advantages and limitations.  Increased accessibility, particularly for geographically isolated or underserved populations, is a significant benefit, alongside improved patient convenience and reduced healthcare costs associated with travel and in-person visits.  Furthermore, telemedicine facilitates proactive care management through remote monitoring, promoting early intervention and disease prevention. However, challenges remain.  Concerns surrounding digital literacy disparities, the reliability of remote diagnoses, data security and privacy, and the lack of standardized regulations across jurisdictions necessitate careful consideration.  While technological advancements continuously improve telemedicine's capabilities, addressing these limitations is crucial for ensuring equitable and high-quality healthcare. This review concludes that while telemedicine offers substantial potential to enhance healthcare delivery, a multifaceted approach encompassing technological innovation, policy development, and equitable resource allocation is vital for its successful and widespread implementation.  Future research should focus on mitigating the identified limitations and further evaluating its long-term impacts on health outcomes.
