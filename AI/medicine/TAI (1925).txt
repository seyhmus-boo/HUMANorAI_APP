Organ transplantation, a life-saving medical marvel, carries significant ethical weight.  Historically, early transplants relied on cadaveric organs, raising questions of consent and the definition of death.  The development of immunosuppressants revolutionized the field, but introduced new dilemmas surrounding resource allocation and the equitable distribution of scarce organs.  

Today, ethical considerations centre on several key areas.  Firstly, donor consent, encompassing both living and deceased donation, demands rigorous processes to ensure autonomy and prevent coercion.  Secondly, the allocation of organs remains a complex issue, often debated in terms of medical urgency versus broader societal needs.  Thirdly, the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation (using animal organs) raises concerns about animal welfare and the potential for zoonotic diseases.  Finally, commercialisation of organs, while largely prohibited, remains a persistent ethical challenge, threatening equitable access and potentially leading to exploitative practices.  These issues necessitate ongoing ethical reflection and robust regulatory frameworks to ensure the integrity and fairness of this vital medical field.
