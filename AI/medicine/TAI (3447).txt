Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transition, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and development of mental health disorders.  This paper investigates current trends in adolescent mental health, examining the prevalence, diagnostic patterns, and contributing factors to a range of disorders, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  While considerable research elucidates the etiology and phenomenology of these conditions, a critical gap remains in translating this knowledge into effective and accessible interventions.  Therefore, this review will also analyze the efficacy of existing treatments, encompassing pharmacological, psychotherapeutic, and integrated approaches.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the practical applications of these findings for clinicians, educators, and policymakers.  Ultimately, this paper aims to contribute to the development of evidence-based strategies for early identification, effective intervention, and improved long-term outcomes for adolescents struggling with mental health challenges, thereby reducing the significant personal, societal, and economic burden associated with these disorders.  This includes exploring the feasibility and impact of preventative measures and the optimization of existing service delivery models.
