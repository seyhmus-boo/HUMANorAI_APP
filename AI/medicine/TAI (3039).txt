Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized healthcare, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  While traditionally understood through a macroscopic lens of instrument design and procedural advancements, this paper explores the evolution of MIS from a quantum mechanical perspective.  This seemingly unconventional approach is justified by recognizing that the fundamental interactions at the nanoscale, governing phenomena like tissue adhesion, laser-tissue interaction, and the behavior of advanced materials used in MIS instruments, are governed by quantum mechanical principles.  We argue that a deeper understanding of these principles is crucial for the continued refinement and innovation within the field. This research will examine the impact of quantum phenomena on key aspects of MIS, including the development of novel surgical tools utilizing quantum-enhanced sensing and manipulation of tissues, the optimization of laser ablation techniques through quantum electrodynamics, and the advancements in nanomaterials for improved biocompatibility and drug delivery.  By bridging the gap between the macroscopic world of surgery and the quantum realm of fundamental physics, we aim to highlight the untapped potential for significant advancements in MIS techniques and pave the way for future research directions.
