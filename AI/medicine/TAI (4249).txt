The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical global challenge. Historically, environmental shifts have consistently impacted human health, with epidemiological evidence linking past climate fluctuations to disease outbreaks and population migrations.  The current anthropogenic climate change exacerbates these historical patterns, presenting novel and multifaceted threats.

Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns influence the distribution of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, expanding their geographical reach and intensifying transmission.  Extreme weather events, amplified by climate change, cause immediate injuries and fatalities, as well as displacement and disruption of healthcare infrastructure, leading to secondary health consequences such as malnutrition and mental health issues.  Furthermore, altered agricultural yields affect food security, contributing to malnutrition and impacting immune function.  The indirect effects, including air pollution exacerbated by climate change and the degradation of water resources, pose further public health burdens.  Understanding this complex interplay is crucial for developing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to safeguard global health.
