Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant threat to global public health, undermining the effectiveness of treatments for bacterial infections.  The rise of AR is driven by a complex interplay of factors, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, and the inherent capacity of bacteria to evolve resistance mechanisms.  This global crisis manifests in increased morbidity and mortality rates associated with infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly concerning in hospital settings and low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).  The economic burden of AR is substantial, encompassing healthcare costs, lost productivity, and reduced economic growth.  Effective mitigation strategies require a multi-pronged approach.  This necessitates improved stewardship programs promoting responsible antibiotic use, investment in innovative diagnostic tools for rapid identification of resistant pathogens, development and deployment of novel antimicrobials, and strengthened surveillance systems for monitoring AR trends.  Furthermore, global collaboration and coordinated actions are crucial to address this complex challenge and ensure the continued efficacy of existing and future antibiotics.  Failure to address AR effectively will have profound implications for healthcare systems globally and will lead to a return to the pre-antibiotic era, where common infections could once again prove fatal.
