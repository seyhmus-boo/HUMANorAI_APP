Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This presentation traces the evolution of MIS techniques, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving advancements.  Early laparoscopic approaches, initially limited by technical challenges and two-dimensional visualization, have been significantly enhanced by robotic-assisted surgery and advanced imaging modalities.  The integration of engineering, computer science, and materials science has yielded sophisticated instruments, including flexible endoscopes, energy devices, and robotic manipulators with improved dexterity and precision.  Furthermore, the synergistic relationship between surgeons, engineers, and computer scientists has facilitated the development of augmented reality and virtual reality systems for surgical planning and intraoperative guidance.  This interdisciplinary approach has also spurred advancements in surgical training, using simulation platforms to hone skills and optimize technique.  We will explore specific examples showcasing the impact of this collaborative innovation on procedure efficacy, patient safety, and the expansion of MIS applications across various surgical specialties.  The presentation concludes by discussing future directions, emphasizing the ongoing potential for interdisciplinary collaboration to further refine and expand the capabilities of minimally invasive surgery.
