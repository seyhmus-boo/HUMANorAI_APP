Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, with diagnoses often delayed or misattributed.  However, recent decades have witnessed a significant increase in recognised diagnoses, reflecting both improved diagnostic tools and a potential rise in prevalence.  Trends indicate a growing burden of anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use disorders among this vulnerable population.  Contributing factors are complex and multifaceted, encompassing genetic predispositions, societal pressures, and rapidly changing technological environments.

Treatment approaches have also evolved.  Previously dominated by institutionalisation, current best practices emphasise evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), often integrated with medication where appropriate.  Early intervention is crucial, as untreated adolescent mental health issues often lead to long-term consequences.  Furthermore, a holistic approach, involving family therapy and school-based support, proves essential for fostering comprehensive recovery and preventing relapse.  Further research into the interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors is vital for developing more effective prevention and treatment strategies.
