Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of bacteria to withstand the effects of antibiotics, poses a significant and escalating global threat.  The overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, as well as agriculture, have driven the selection and proliferation of resistant strains, rendering previously effective treatments ineffective. Recent developments underscore the gravity of this crisis.  Studies consistently demonstrate a worrying increase in the prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly concerning are infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. This trend is not geographically limited;  AR is observed across high-, middle-, and low-income countries, exacerbating existing health inequalities.  Furthermore,  research highlights the emergence of novel resistance mechanisms, complicating efforts to develop new antibiotics.  This necessitates a multi-pronged approach involving stringent stewardship programs to minimize antibiotic use, accelerated development of novel antimicrobial therapies, including alternative approaches such as phage therapy and immunotherapy, and substantial investment in global surveillance and monitoring systems to track resistance patterns and inform public health interventions.  The lack of sufficient progress in combating AR threatens to reverse decades of progress in infectious disease control, with potentially catastrophic implications for global health security.
