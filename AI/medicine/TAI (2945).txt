Cancer, a complex group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, presents a significant global health challenge. While considerable progress has been made in understanding its etiology and developing treatment strategies, the inherent heterogeneity of cancer necessitates a paradigm shift towards personalized medicine.  This approach hinges upon deciphering the intricate genetic landscape of individual tumors to tailor therapeutic interventions.  However, unraveling the genetic basis of cancer for personalized applications faces substantial experimental challenges.  This paper explores these challenges, focusing primarily on the complexities of identifying driver mutations amidst a background of passenger mutations, the difficulties in accurately predicting treatment response based on genomic profiles, and the limitations of current technologies in comprehensively analyzing the vast genetic heterogeneity within and between tumors.  Furthermore, we will discuss the ethical implications associated with the use of genomic data in personalized cancer treatment and the need for robust validation of genomic-driven therapies.  Addressing these experimental hurdles is crucial for realizing the full potential of personalized medicine in improving cancer patient outcomes.
