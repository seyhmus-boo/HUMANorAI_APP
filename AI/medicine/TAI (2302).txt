Cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease driven by somatic mutations accumulating within a cell's genome.  Recent advances in genomic technologies, including next-generation sequencing and bioinformatics, have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Whole-genome and exome sequencing now routinely identify driver mutations, fusion genes, and copy number variations specific to individual tumors, enabling precise classification and prognosis. This detailed genetic profiling allows for the selection of targeted therapies matched to specific oncogenic alterations, exemplified by the success of tyrosine kinase inhibitors against specific mutations in lung cancer.  Furthermore, advancements in liquid biopsies, utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), offer minimally invasive methods for monitoring disease progression, detecting residual disease, and guiding treatment adjustments.  While challenges remain, including the identification of therapeutically targetable mutations and the management of treatment resistance, the integration of genomic data with clinical information through sophisticated computational models is increasingly shaping cancer treatment strategies toward a more personalized and effective approach.  Future research will focus on elucidating the complex interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for cancer patients.
