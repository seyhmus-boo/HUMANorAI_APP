Cancer's genetic basis, characterized by somatic mutations driving uncontrolled proliferation, fuels the promise of personalized medicine.  Identifying these mutations through techniques like next-generation sequencing allows for targeted therapies tailored to individual tumor profiles. However, significant experimental challenges remain.  Firstly, the sheer heterogeneity within and between tumors presents a considerable hurdle.  A single tumor may comprise multiple clonal populations, each with distinct genetic alterations, complicating treatment selection and predicting response.  Secondly, identifying driver mutations amidst passenger mutations remains a complex bioinformatic challenge requiring sophisticated algorithms and validation.  Furthermore, functional characterization of newly discovered mutations necessitates robust in vitro and in vivo models that accurately reflect tumor microenvironment complexity.  The cost and accessibility of comprehensive genomic profiling also pose limitations to widespread implementation of personalized oncology.  Finally, predicting long-term treatment efficacy and resistance development remains an active area of research, requiring longitudinal studies and the development of predictive biomarkers.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is crucial for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer therapy.
