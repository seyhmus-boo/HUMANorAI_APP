While not directly employing quantum mechanical calculations in clinical practice, our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer and its application in personalized medicine is significantly informed by quantum phenomena.  The intricate, complex interactions within DNA – a molecule whose structure and function are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles – are crucial.  Electron delocalization within base pairs and the quantum tunneling effects influencing DNA mutations, though not directly manipulated therapeutically, underpin the stochastic nature of carcinogenesis.

Advances in sequencing technologies, providing high-resolution genomic data, rely on quantum mechanical effects in instrumentation, such as laser-induced fluorescence.  This precise data allows identification of driver mutations and specific genetic vulnerabilities within a patient's tumour, paving the way for targeted therapies.  For instance, understanding the quantum-mechanical interactions between drugs and their target proteins, mutated due to cancerous transformations, informs the design of more effective and specific chemotherapeutics.  Ultimately, personalized medicine leverages quantum-influenced advancements to move beyond broad-spectrum treatments toward a more precise and effective approach to cancer management.
