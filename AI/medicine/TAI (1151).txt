The genetic basis of cancer, characterized by somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations, is increasingly understood at the molecular level, paving the way for personalized medicine approaches.  While classical molecular biology provides a framework for understanding gene expression and protein function, a quantum mechanical perspective offers nuanced insights into the underlying processes.  Quantum effects, such as electron tunneling and proton transfer, play critical roles in DNA damage repair pathways and enzymatic activity crucial in oncogenesis.  Advances in computational quantum chemistry allow for *in silico* modeling of key biomolecules implicated in cancer, including mutated proteins and DNA adducts, revealing structure-function relationships at atomic resolution.  This allows for a deeper understanding of drug-target interactions and the prediction of drug efficacy and toxicity, surpassing classical approaches.  Furthermore, quantum dots and other nanomaterials are being developed for targeted cancer therapy, leveraging their unique quantum mechanical properties for improved drug delivery and imaging.  However, challenges remain in scaling up quantum computations and integrating this complex data into clinically relevant decision-making.  Future research will focus on refining quantum models, developing more sophisticated algorithms, and bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and clinical outcomes in personalized cancer treatment.
