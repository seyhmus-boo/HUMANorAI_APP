This presentation explores the evolution of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques through the lens of quantum mechanics, focusing on the implications of precision and control at the nanoscale.  While traditionally viewed through a classical mechanics framework, the increasing sophistication of MIS necessitates a quantum-informed perspective.  We argue that advancements such as robotic surgery and laser ablation, once considered distinct, are converging toward a unified approach governed by principles analogous to quantum superposition and entanglement.  Robotic manipulation, enabling sub-millimeter precision, can be interpreted as controlling the “quantum state” of the surgical instrument, allowing for superposition of potential actions before definitive execution.  Similarly, laser ablation, targeting specific molecules within tissues, exhibits entanglement-like characteristics, as the effect on one molecule influences neighboring ones through photon-tissue interactions. This perspective challenges the traditional understanding of MIS as solely a macroscopic manipulation, highlighting the underlying quantum phenomena driving improved accuracy and reduced invasiveness.  We will examine the implications of this evolving quantum-informed approach for future developments in surgical instrumentation, image guidance, and targeted drug delivery, advocating for a paradigm shift in the design and execution of MIS procedures.
