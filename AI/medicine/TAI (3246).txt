This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the genetic basis of cancer and their translation into personalized medicine.  Significant progress has been made in identifying driver mutations across diverse cancer types through next-generation sequencing technologies. This has facilitated the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, demonstrating improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapies in specific patient subgroups.  However, the complexity of cancer genomes, including intratumor heterogeneity and the interplay between genetic and epigenetic alterations, presents ongoing challenges.  While genomic profiling is increasingly integrated into clinical practice, limitations remain regarding cost-effectiveness, access, and the interpretation of complex genomic data.  Future research should focus on improving the predictive power of genomic biomarkers, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and developing more sophisticated computational tools for data analysis and interpretation.  Ultimately, a deeper understanding of cancer genetics will be crucial for the continued advancement of truly personalized cancer care, moving towards precision oncology tailored to individual patient profiles.
