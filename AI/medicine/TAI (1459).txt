Adolescent mental health disorders represent a growing global concern, with escalating prevalence rates observed across various conditions.  This lecture will examine salient trends in the epidemiology of disorders such as anxiety, depression, and substance use, highlighting the influence of societal factors like increased screen time and social media usage.  We will explore the complex interplay between biological vulnerabilities, environmental stressors, and developmental trajectories in shaping the manifestation and course of these disorders.  Treatment approaches, including evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), will be discussed, alongside the role of pharmacological interventions where appropriate.  The lecture will further address challenges in accessing timely and effective care, including the stigma surrounding mental health, limited resources, and the need for integrated, multi-systemic approaches.  Finally, future directions in research and prevention strategies aimed at improving adolescent mental wellbeing will be outlined.
