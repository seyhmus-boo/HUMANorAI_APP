This presentation examines current trends and effective treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents, a population experiencing a concerning rise in prevalence.  We will explore recent epidemiological data highlighting shifts in the types and severity of disorders, focusing on the increasing rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviours.  The presentation will delve into the multifaceted etiology of these disorders, considering biological, psychological, and socio-environmental factors.

Furthermore, we will critically evaluate evidence-based treatments, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), and medication management.  Specific focus will be given to the efficacy of adapted therapeutic approaches for adolescents, emphasizing the importance of considering developmental stage and individual needs.  Practical applications will be discussed, including strategies for early identification through school-based screening programs and the development of effective collaborative care models involving families, schools, and mental health professionals.  The presentation concludes by highlighting the need for further research into preventative interventions and culturally sensitive care to address the growing mental health crisis amongst young people.
