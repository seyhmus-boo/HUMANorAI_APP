Cancer, a complex disease characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, has long been understood to have a genetic basis.  Early research focused on identifying single oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, leading to breakthroughs such as the discovery of *RAS* and *p53*.  However, the complexity of cancer's genetic landscape became increasingly apparent with the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies. These technologies revealed the vast heterogeneity of cancer genomes, highlighting the presence of numerous mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic alterations that contribute to tumorigenesis. This understanding fueled the development of personalized medicine, enabling the tailoring of cancer treatment based on an individual patient's tumor genomic profile.  Advances include targeted therapies inhibiting specific mutated oncogenes (e.g., EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer) and immunotherapy harnessing the patient's immune system to attack cancer cells expressing neoantigens.  Challenges remain, including the identification of actionable mutations, the development of robust predictive biomarkers, and addressing the high cost and accessibility of genomic testing. Despite these challenges, the ongoing integration of genomic data into clinical practice continues to revolutionize cancer treatment, improving outcomes and paving the way for more effective and precise therapeutic strategies.
