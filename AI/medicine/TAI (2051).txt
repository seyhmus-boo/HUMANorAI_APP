Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the burgeoning field of personalized oncology, driven by advancements in understanding the genetic basis of cancer.  Historically, cancer treatment was largely uniform.  However, the advent of high-throughput sequencing has revolutionized our approach.  We now recognize that cancers are genetically heterogeneous, driven by diverse somatic mutations affecting oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair pathways.

This understanding allows for targeted therapies.  Next-generation sequencing readily identifies specific mutations, guiding selection of therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors for EGFR-mutated lung cancers or BRAF inhibitors for melanomas.  Furthermore, immunotherapies, harnessing the patient's immune system, are increasingly personalized.  Biomarker analysis informs treatment choice and predicts response, maximizing efficacy and minimizing toxicity.  While challenges remain, such as the complexity of mutational landscapes and the emergence of resistance, ongoing research into genomic instability, epigenetic modifications, and circulating tumor DNA promises further refinements in personalized cancer management.
