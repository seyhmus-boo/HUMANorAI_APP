Organ transplantation, a remarkable feat of medical advancement, remains fraught with complex ethical dilemmas demanding interdisciplinary scrutiny.  The scarcity of viable organs necessitates difficult allocation decisions, prompting debate across medical ethics, law, and economics.  This research paper examines the multifaceted ethical considerations inherent in organ transplantation, highlighting the crucial interplay between various disciplines.  We explore the ethical frameworks guiding organ procurement, focusing on issues of informed consent, potential coercion of vulnerable populations, and the equitable distribution of limited resources.  Furthermore, we analyze the legal parameters surrounding organ donation and transplantation, including legislation concerning presumed consent and the regulation of organ trafficking.  The economic implications, such as the high cost of transplantation and the potential for disparities in access based on socioeconomic status, will also be addressed.  By drawing on insights from bioethics, law, economics, sociology, and public health, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the ethical challenges facing the field of organ transplantation and proposes avenues for future ethical frameworks and policy improvements.
