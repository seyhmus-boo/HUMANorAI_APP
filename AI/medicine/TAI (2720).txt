Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, jeopardizing the effectiveness of treatments for bacterial infections.  The rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly Gram-negative bacteria and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), necessitates urgent action.  Recent developments underscore the complexity of this challenge.  Whole-genome sequencing is increasingly used to track the spread of resistance genes, revealing the role of mobile genetic elements and horizontal gene transfer in accelerating AR dissemination.  Furthermore, research highlights the impact of environmental factors, including antibiotic use in agriculture and wastewater, on the emergence and persistence of resistant strains.  Strategies to combat AR encompass various approaches, including the development of novel antibiotics, alternative therapies like bacteriophages and antimicrobial peptides, and improved infection prevention and control measures.  However, success necessitates a One Health approach, integrating human, animal, and environmental health strategies, along with strengthened global surveillance and responsible antibiotic stewardship programs.  Failing to address AR effectively will lead to escalating morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs globally.
