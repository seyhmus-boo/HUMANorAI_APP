Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times compared to traditional open surgery.  This paper explores the evolution of these techniques, tracing their development from nascent stages to the sophisticated procedures employed today.  The historical roots of MIS can be found in the early 20th century, with the advent of endoscopy and the gradual refinement of techniques for accessing internal organs through smaller incisions.  Early examples, such as the development of laparoscopy in the 1930s and its subsequent refinement throughout the latter half of the century, demonstrated the potential of this approach but faced significant technological limitations.  The progress in MIS has been characterized by a continuous interplay between advancements in imaging technology, instrumentation, and surgical skills.  This paper will analyze this interplay, examining key milestones such as the introduction of advanced energy sources, robotic surgery, and the increasing integration of computer-assisted navigation systems. Finally, we will discuss the future directions of MIS, focusing on emerging technologies and the ongoing pursuit of even less invasive and more precise procedures.
