The escalating global threat of antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant challenge to public health infrastructure and sustainable development.  Driven by factors including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, agriculture, and aquaculture, AR leads to treatment failures for bacterial infections, resulting in prolonged illness, increased mortality, and substantial healthcare costs.  The emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, are particularly concerning, as they severely limit treatment options.  This phenomenon is exacerbated by inadequate infection prevention and control measures, coupled with limited access to diagnostics and effective antimicrobials in low- and middle-income countries.  The global implications are far-reaching, impacting healthcare systems' capacity to manage infectious diseases, threatening food security through the impact on livestock production, and potentially undermining the efficacy of medical procedures such as surgery and organ transplantation.  Addressing this complex issue requires a multi-pronged approach involving stewardship programs, improved diagnostics, the development of novel antimicrobials and alternative therapeutic strategies, and increased global collaboration and resource allocation.  Failure to act decisively will result in a return to a pre-antibiotic era, with devastating consequences for global health and socioeconomic stability.
