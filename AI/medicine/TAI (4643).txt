Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, prioritizing smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery. This presentation explores the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving advancements.  Early MIS relied heavily on laparoscopy, but recent decades have witnessed a surge in robotic surgery, single-port access, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).  These innovations have necessitated significant interdisciplinary engagement, encompassing surgeons, engineers, materials scientists, and imaging specialists.  The development of advanced robotic platforms, for instance, required close collaboration between surgical teams and robotics engineers to optimize dexterity, precision, and haptic feedback.  Similarly, the advancement of image-guided surgery depends on close collaboration with radiologists and imaging physicists for improved visualization and navigation during complex procedures.  Furthermore, the development of novel biocompatible materials and surgical instruments is a testament to successful partnerships between surgeons and materials scientists.  This presentation will analyze key milestones in MIS technique evolution, emphasizing the vital role of cross-disciplinary partnerships in achieving improved patient outcomes, enhanced surgical precision, and the expansion of minimally invasive approaches to a wider range of surgical specialties.
