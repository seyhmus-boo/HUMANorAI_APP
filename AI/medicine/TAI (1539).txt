Mental health disorders in adolescents are a growing global concern, exhibiting increasing prevalence rates across various diagnoses. This abstract reviews recent trends in adolescent mental health, highlighting rising diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors, particularly among girls.  Contributing factors include societal pressures, increased screen time, and the impact of social media.  Treatment approaches remain diverse, encompassing evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), alongside pharmacological interventions like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  However, access to timely and appropriate care remains a significant barrier, particularly in underserved communities.  This review emphasizes the critical need for early identification strategies, utilizing school-based screening programs and increased parental awareness.  Effective implementation of integrated care models, combining mental health services with primary care, is crucial. Furthermore, promoting digital mental health interventions offers potential for increased accessibility and engagement, particularly among adolescents. Future research should focus on improving early intervention strategies and optimizing treatment delivery models to address the complex and evolving landscape of adolescent mental health.
