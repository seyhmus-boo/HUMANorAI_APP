The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine. Early research, focusing on chromosomal abnormalities like the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), laid the groundwork for targeted therapies.  Subsequent advancements in genomics, particularly high-throughput sequencing, have identified numerous driver mutations across various cancers, revealing the intricate heterogeneity within and between tumor types.  This has enabled the identification of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes involved in carcinogenesis, facilitating the development of targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for CML and BRAF inhibitors for melanoma.

However, the complexity of cancer genetics remains a significant challenge.  Intratumoral heterogeneity, where different cells within a single tumor harbor distinct genetic alterations, necessitates comprehensive genomic profiling to guide treatment selection.  Furthermore, the interplay between genetic mutations and the tumor microenvironment, along with the emergence of drug resistance mutations, highlight the limitations of purely genotype-driven approaches.  Ongoing research focuses on integrating genomic data with other "omics" data (transcriptomics, proteomics) and clinical parameters to develop more effective and precise personalized cancer therapies, improving patient outcomes and reducing adverse effects.
