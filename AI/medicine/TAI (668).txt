Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma compared to open surgery, has revolutionized surgical practice. This paper explores the evolutionary trajectory of surgical techniques within MIS, tracing its development from its nascent stages to the sophisticated technologies employed today.  The historical roots of MIS can be traced back to early attempts at endoscopic procedures, with rudimentary explorations of the body's interior dating back to the late 19th century.  However, significant advancements were hampered by limitations in instrumentation and imaging. The pivotal development of the laparoscope in the mid-20th century, alongside improvements in fiber optics and illumination, marked a crucial turning point, enabling visualization of internal structures through smaller incisions.  Subsequent decades witnessed a rapid expansion in the application of MIS across diverse surgical specialties, driven by the concurrent evolution of specialized instruments, including energy sources like lasers and ultrasonic devices, and the integration of advanced imaging modalities such as 3D laparoscopy and robotic assistance. This paper will analyze the key technological advancements that have propelled the growth of MIS, exploring both the challenges overcome and the ongoing innovations shaping the future of this transformative field.
