Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation. The rise of AR is driven by complex interactions between human behavior (e.g., antibiotic overuse and misuse), agricultural practices (e.g., routine antibiotic use in livestock), and environmental factors (e.g., antibiotic pollution).  This abstract highlights the critical interdisciplinary links required to combat AR.  Epidemiology provides crucial data on resistance patterns and spread, informing public health interventions.  One Health initiatives recognize the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, advocating for integrated surveillance and control strategies.  Advances in microbiology and genomics are vital for understanding resistance mechanisms and developing novel therapeutics, while social sciences elucidate behavioural drivers of antibiotic use and inform effective public health communication.  Furthermore, economic analyses are necessary to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of interventions and resource allocation.  Successfully addressing the global AR crisis requires integrating knowledge and expertise from these diverse fields, fostering collaborative research and policy development for sustainable solutions.  This necessitates a global, coordinated effort to reduce antibiotic pressure, improve diagnostics, and develop novel antimicrobials and alternative therapies.
