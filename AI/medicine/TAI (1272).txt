Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, with disorders often misattributed to typical teenage angst or dismissed altogether.  However, recent decades have witnessed a significant increase in both the recognition and prevalence of mental health disorders among adolescents.  Trends reveal a concerning rise in conditions such as anxiety disorders, depression, and self-harm behaviors, particularly amongst girls.  Contributing factors are complex and multifaceted, encompassing societal pressures related to academic performance, social media usage, and identity formation, alongside biological vulnerabilities and familial influences.  Treatment approaches have evolved alongside this increased awareness, shifting from primarily psychodynamic models towards a more integrated biopsychosocial framework. This encompasses evidence-based therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), alongside pharmacological interventions where appropriate.  Early intervention is crucial, as untreated adolescent mental health disorders can significantly impact long-term well-being, educational attainment, and adult mental health outcomes.  Research continues to refine diagnostic criteria, treatment modalities, and preventative strategies, aiming to mitigate the growing burden of adolescent mental illness.
