Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This presentation explores the complex interplay between environmental shifts and human wellbeing, highlighting critical interdisciplinary links.  We will examine the direct impacts of climate change, such as increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the exacerbation of vector-borne diseases, and the disruption of food security and water resources, drawing upon epidemiological data and environmental science.  Furthermore, we will discuss indirect impacts, including the mental health consequences of extreme weather events, displacement, and social disruption, necessitating insights from psychology and sociology.  The presentation will also emphasize the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in developing effective public health interventions.  This includes integrating climate modelling with public health planning, incorporating social determinants of health into climate adaptation strategies, and fostering effective communication between scientists, policymakers, and communities. Ultimately, a holistic, interdisciplinary approach is critical for building climate-resilient health systems and protecting vulnerable populations.
