This presentation examines emerging trends in adolescent mental health disorders, focusing on the increasing prevalence of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviours.  We will review recent epidemiological data highlighting geographical variations and potential contributing factors, such as social media usage, academic pressure, and societal changes.  The presentation will then explore current treatment modalities, comparing the effectiveness of evidence-based interventions including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacological approaches.  Particular attention will be given to the challenges of access to timely and appropriate care, including disparities based on socioeconomic status and cultural background.  Finally, we will discuss practical applications for clinicians and educators, offering strategies for early identification, fostering supportive environments, and effectively navigating the referral process for adolescents requiring specialized mental health services.  This includes highlighting the importance of collaborative care models integrating mental and physical healthcare, and utilizing technology to enhance access to treatment.
