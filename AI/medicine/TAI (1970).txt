Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery times, represents a significant advancement in surgical practice.  This paper explores the evolution of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, tracing its development from its nascent stages to its current sophisticated state. The historical roots of MIS can be traced back to early endoscopic procedures in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, notably in the field of urology and gynecology, where limited access necessitated innovative approaches.  However, the true proliferation of MIS began in the latter half of the 20th century with advancements in fiber optics, imaging technology, and instrumentation.  Laparoscopic cholecystectomy, pioneered in the 1980s, served as a landmark achievement, demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of MIS on a large scale.  This initial success spurred rapid innovation, leading to the development of refined surgical instruments, improved imaging modalities, and the emergence of robotic-assisted surgery. This paper will analyze the key technological advancements driving this evolution, assess the impact on surgical outcomes and patient care, and finally discuss the ongoing challenges and future directions of MIS techniques.
