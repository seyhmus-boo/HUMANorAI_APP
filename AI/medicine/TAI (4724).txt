This presentation examines the evolving landscape of mental health disorders in adolescents, tracing historical trends and exploring contemporary treatment approaches.  Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with diagnoses and interventions lagging behind those for adults.  Early understandings were limited, often attributing adolescent distress to developmental phases rather than diagnosable conditions.  However, increased awareness and research over the past few decades have revealed a concerning rise in prevalence rates for conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  This rise is likely multifactorial, influenced by societal pressures, technological advancements, and evolving family structures.

This presentation will outline key epidemiological data illustrating these shifts, focusing on variations in prevalence across genders and socio-economic groups.  Furthermore, it will critically evaluate the efficacy of current treatment modalities, including evidence-based psychotherapies (e.g., Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Dialectical Behavior Therapy) and psychopharmacological interventions.  The discussion will also touch upon emerging challenges, such as the increasing need for accessible and culturally sensitive care, and the integration of technological innovations in mental health service delivery.  Ultimately, this presentation aims to highlight the urgent need for continued research, improved early intervention strategies, and increased access to comprehensive mental healthcare for adolescents.
