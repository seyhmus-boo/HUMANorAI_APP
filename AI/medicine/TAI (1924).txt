Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are deeply intertwined with its historical development. Early practices, often lacking robust consent procedures and prioritizing societal needs over individual autonomy, highlighted significant ethical vulnerabilities. The evolution of transplantation has been marked by a growing emphasis on informed consent, equitable allocation, and the prevention of coercion, particularly concerning vulnerable populations.  However, challenges persist.  The persistent global shortage of organs necessitates complex allocation algorithms, raising questions of fairness and potentially disadvantaging certain groups based on factors unrelated to medical need.  Furthermore, the debate surrounding the definition of death and the implications for organ procurement remains a sensitive area.  The commercialization of organs, prevalent in some regions, poses severe ethical dilemmas, exacerbating existing inequalities and undermining the altruistic principles underpinning the field.  Ultimately, the field continues to grapple with balancing the imperative to save lives with the protection of individual rights and the prevention of exploitation, requiring ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue and the development of robust regulatory frameworks.
