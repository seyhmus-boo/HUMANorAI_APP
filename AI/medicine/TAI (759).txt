The genetic basis of cancer has been a cornerstone of biomedical research since the discovery of oncogenes in the 1970s.  Early studies focused on identifying single gene mutations driving uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.  This foundational work laid the groundwork for understanding cancer as a genetic disease, paving the way for targeted therapies.  However, the complexity of cancer genetics, involving multiple somatic mutations and epigenetic modifications, soon became apparent.

Recent technological advancements, particularly in next-generation sequencing, have revolutionized our ability to comprehensively characterize the genomic landscape of individual tumors.  This has led to significant progress in personalized medicine, enabling the identification of actionable mutations informing treatment strategies.  This presentation will review the historical trajectory of cancer genetics research, highlighting key discoveries and technological innovations.  Furthermore, it will explore current applications of genomic profiling in guiding cancer treatment decisions, including the selection of targeted therapies, immunotherapies, and the prediction of treatment response and resistance.  The challenges and future directions of personalized oncology, encompassing the integration of multi-omics data and artificial intelligence, will also be discussed.  Ultimately, this presentation aims to showcase how the unraveling of cancerâ€™s genetic complexity is driving a paradigm shift towards precision medicine.
