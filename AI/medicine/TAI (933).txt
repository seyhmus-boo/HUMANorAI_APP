Organ transplantation represents a significant advancement in medical science, offering life-saving and life-enhancing opportunities for patients with end-stage organ failure. However, the inherent scarcity of transplantable organs necessitates a complex ethical framework to govern allocation and access. This paper examines the multifaceted ethical considerations surrounding organ transplantation, focusing on three key areas. Firstly, we address the ethical dilemmas arising from the allocation of scarce organs, exploring the tension between utilitarian principles of maximizing benefit and deontological concerns for individual rights and justice.  Secondly, we analyze the ethical implications of different organ procurement methods, including deceased donation and living donation, considering informed consent, potential coercion, and the vulnerability of potential donors. Finally, we discuss the ethical challenges associated with organ trafficking and commercialization, emphasizing the need for robust regulatory mechanisms to prevent exploitation and ensure equitable access.  This analysis will contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the ethical complexities inherent in organ transplantation, highlighting the need for ongoing dialogue and the development of ethically sound policies and practices.
