Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and development of mental health disorders.  The prevalence of conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders is rising globally, posing significant challenges to individual well-being and societal health.  This paper examines contemporary trends in adolescent mental health, analyzing the evolving epidemiology of key disorders and exploring contributing factors such as societal pressures, technological advancements, and genetic vulnerabilities.  Crucially, it emphasizes the necessity of an interdisciplinary approach to treatment and prevention.  Effective intervention requires the integrated expertise of psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, educators, and family therapists, acknowledging the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social determinants impacting mental health.  We will explore the strengths and limitations of various therapeutic modalities, including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and family-based interventions, highlighting the benefits of collaborative care models that tailor interventions to individual needs and contexts.  Ultimately, this research underscores the urgent need for holistic and collaborative strategies to address the burgeoning crisis of adolescent mental health.
