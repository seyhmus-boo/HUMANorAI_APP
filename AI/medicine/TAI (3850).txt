Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This presentation will explore the significant evolution of MIS techniques, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving this progress.  We will trace the development from early laparoscopic approaches to the current landscape incorporating robotics, advanced imaging, and image-guided navigation.  The increasing sophistication of these techniques necessitates close collaboration between surgeons, engineers, computer scientists, and biomedical engineers.  Examples of this synergy will be discussed, such as the development of robotic platforms with enhanced dexterity and haptic feedback, and the integration of augmented reality for real-time surgical planning and execution.  Further, we will address the challenges associated with  expanding the applications of MIS to more complex procedures and the ongoing need for improved training methods and standardized protocols to ensure optimal patient safety and consistent outcomes.  Finally, we will briefly examine future trends, including the potential for artificial intelligence and personalized medicine to further refine and personalize MIS approaches.
