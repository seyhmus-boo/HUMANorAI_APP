Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, driven by continuous advancements in instrumentation, imaging, and surgical techniques. This abstract traces the evolution of MIS techniques, highlighting key milestones.  Early laparoscopic procedures, initially limited by two-dimensional visualization and rigid instrumentation, laid the foundation. The subsequent development of advanced energy sources (e.g., laser, ultrasonic, bipolar) enabled improved precision and hemostasis.  The introduction of 3D laparoscopy and robotic surgery significantly enhanced dexterity and visualization, facilitating complex procedures previously impossible via MIS.  Concurrent improvements in imaging modalities, including enhanced endoscopy and intraoperative ultrasound, have provided surgeons with real-time, high-resolution anatomical information.  Recent trends include single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), striving for even smaller incisions and reduced trauma.  Further innovation in areas such as augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and flexible robotics promises to further refine MIS, leading to enhanced patient outcomes, shorter recovery times, and reduced hospital stays.  However, challenges remain in addressing the learning curve associated with advanced techniques and ensuring equitable access to these technologies globally.
