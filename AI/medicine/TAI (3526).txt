The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as complex and multifaceted.  Historically, environmental health concerns, such as waterborne diseases linked to sanitation, foreshadowed the current understanding. However, anthropogenic climate change amplifies existing vulnerabilities and introduces novel threats.  Rising global temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns influence the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, expanding their geographic range and transmission seasons.  Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, lead to injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences.

Furthermore, climate change impacts food security and nutrition, potentially leading to malnutrition and undernutrition.  Air pollution, worsened by climate-altering emissions, contributes to respiratory illnesses.  Sea-level rise and coastal erosion displace populations, increasing the risk of infectious disease outbreaks in overcrowded temporary settlements.  Therefore, addressing climate change is not solely an environmental imperative but a crucial public health intervention, requiring a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach.
