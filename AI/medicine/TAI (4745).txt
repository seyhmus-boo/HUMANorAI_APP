Minimally invasive surgical techniques have undergone a dramatic evolution since their inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and robotic technology. Early laparoscopic procedures, characterized by limited visualization and dexterity, have given way to sophisticated techniques employing advanced energy sources, such as ultrasonic shears and bipolar coagulation, enabling more precise tissue dissection and hemostasis.  The development of flexible endoscopes with enhanced resolution and integrated optics has significantly improved visualization, allowing for more complex procedures to be performed minimally invasively.  Recent years have witnessed the rise of robotic-assisted surgery, which offers surgeons enhanced dexterity, precision, and three-dimensional visualization through intuitive interfaces.  This technology has broadened the scope of minimally invasive surgery into previously inaccessible areas, facilitating complex procedures with reduced trauma and improved patient outcomes.  Furthermore, the integration of augmented reality and artificial intelligence holds significant promise for further refining surgical precision and reducing complication rates, particularly in areas such as image-guided interventions and personalized surgical planning. This ongoing evolution underscores the continued pursuit of minimally invasive approaches aiming for optimal patient safety and faster recovery.
