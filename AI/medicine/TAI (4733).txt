This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in definitively establishing the causal link between climate change and public health outcomes. While observational studies reveal strong correlations between rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and increased morbidity/mortality, isolating climate changeâ€™s specific contribution remains complex.  Confounding factors, such as socioeconomic disparities, pre-existing health conditions, and rapid urbanization, often obscure the direct impact of climate-related stressors.  Further complicating matters is the long latency period between climate change-related exposures and subsequent health effects, hindering the design and execution of robust epidemiological studies.  We discuss the limitations of traditional experimental approaches like randomized controlled trials in this context, highlighting the ethical and logistical barriers.  The presentation will critically assess innovative methodological approaches, including advanced statistical modelling techniques, natural experiments utilizing geographically disparate populations, and the integration of big data sources to improve causal inference.  Finally, we will outline crucial areas for future research focusing on strengthening the experimental evidence base to inform effective public health interventions and adaptation strategies.
