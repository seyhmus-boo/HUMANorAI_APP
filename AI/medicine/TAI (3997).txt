Climate change poses a profound and multifaceted threat to global public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to fully comprehend its complex impacts and develop effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This research paper investigates the intricate relationship between climate change and public health, highlighting the critical connections between environmental science, epidemiology, sociology, economics, and public policy.  While the direct effects of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, on mortality and morbidity are well-documented, this study explores the broader, less understood consequences.  These include the indirect impacts on infectious disease transmission, air quality deterioration, food security, mental health, and the exacerbation of existing health inequalities.  By integrating insights from diverse disciplines, we aim to unravel the intricate pathways through which climate change affects population health, identify vulnerable populations, and evaluate the effectiveness of various interventions.  This interdisciplinary framework is crucial for developing comprehensive and context-specific strategies to protect public health in a rapidly changing climate.  The paper will conclude by outlining key recommendations for future research and policy directions.
