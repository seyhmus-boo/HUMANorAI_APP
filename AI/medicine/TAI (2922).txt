Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This presentation explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and various health outcomes.  We will examine the direct impacts of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and wildfires, on morbidity and mortality, highlighting the disproportionate burden experienced by vulnerable populations.  Furthermore, we will discuss the indirect consequences, including the altered distribution of vector-borne diseases, the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to air pollution, and the impact on food security and mental health.  Existing literature demonstrates a strong correlation between rising temperatures and increased mortality rates, particularly among elderly individuals.  Changes in precipitation patterns are also linked to waterborne diseases and malnutrition.  The presentation will synthesize current scientific evidence to illustrate the urgent need for integrated climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect public health.  Finally, we will briefly discuss policy implications and potential avenues for collaborative research to strengthen resilience and reduce the health impacts of climate change.
