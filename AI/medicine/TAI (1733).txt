Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain complex and are further challenged by the rapid advancements in experimental therapies. This presentation explores the ethical dilemmas arising from the experimental application of novel techniques within the field.  We will specifically address the challenges presented by xenotransplantation, focusing on the inherent risks to both donor animals and recipient humans, alongside the potential for unforeseen long-term consequences.  Furthermore, the ethical implications of using induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) for organ generation will be examined, considering issues of informed consent, resource allocation, and potential for commercial exploitation.  The presentation will also delve into the ethical complexities surrounding the use of experimental therapies in vulnerable populations, considering issues of equity and justice in access to potentially life-saving treatments.  Ultimately, we argue that navigating these experimental frontiers requires a robust ethical framework that prioritizes patient well-being, safeguards animal welfare, and promotes equitable access to innovative transplantation technologies.  The presentation will conclude by outlining key areas requiring further ethical debate and policy development.
