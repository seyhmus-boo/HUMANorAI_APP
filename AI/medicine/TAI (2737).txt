Antibiotic resistance poses a significant global health threat, necessitating novel approaches beyond traditional drug discovery. This presentation explores the potential of quantum mechanical (QM) methods to address this challenge from a fundamental perspective.  While classical molecular dynamics offer insights, QM calculations, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock methods, provide a more accurate description of electronic structure crucial for understanding drug-target interactions at the atomic level. We will discuss how QM simulations can be employed to elucidate the mechanisms of resistance, focusing on mutations in antibiotic targets and the binding affinities of modified antibiotics.  This includes analyzing conformational changes, identifying key residues involved in resistance, and predicting the effectiveness of potential inhibitors. Furthermore, we will explore the use of QM-based high-throughput virtual screening to identify novel antibiotic candidates with enhanced efficacy against resistant strains.  Finally, the presentation will outline the challenges and future prospects of employing QM methodologies for combating antibiotic resistance, including the development of more efficient algorithms and the integration of QM with machine learning techniques for accelerated drug discovery.  This multi-faceted approach offers a promising avenue towards tackling this critical global health issue.
