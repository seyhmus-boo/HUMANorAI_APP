Climate change poses a significant and growing threat to global public health.  Historical analyses reveal a long-standing relationship, with early observations linking extreme weather events to disease outbreaks and mortality. However, the contemporary understanding encompasses far broader impacts beyond immediate mortality from heatwaves and extreme weather.  Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns influence the geographic distribution and prevalence of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, impacting vulnerable populations disproportionately.  Increased air pollution exacerbates respiratory illnesses, while alterations in food security and water availability contribute to malnutrition and waterborne diseases.  Climate change also indirectly influences mental health through displacement, economic hardship, and trauma related to extreme weather events.  Furthermore, climate-related migration and resource scarcity can fuel conflict, increasing the risk of injury and death.  Quantifying the precise burden of climate change on health remains a challenge due to complex interactions and data limitations.  However, substantial evidence underscores the urgent need for integrated strategies that mitigate climate change and simultaneously bolster public health resilience through adaptation measures, strengthening health systems, and promoting equitable access to healthcare.
