Advances in genomic sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of cancer's genetic basis, paving the way for personalized medicine approaches.  Cancer is fundamentally a disease of somatic mutations, with distinct genomic profiles characterizing different tumor types and even individual patient tumors.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enable comprehensive profiling of these mutations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions (indels), copy number variations (CNVs), and structural rearrangements.  This information allows for the identification of driver mutations – those directly contributing to tumorigenesis –  and passenger mutations – those with no direct oncogenic role.  The identification of specific driver mutations has led to the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for specific mutations in EGFR or ALK in lung cancer.  Furthermore, genomic profiling informs prognosis and stratifies patients into risk groups, enabling tailored treatment strategies and improving treatment response prediction.  However, challenges remain, including the cost and complexity of NGS, the interpretation of complex genomic data, and the identification of effective therapeutic targets for all genomic alterations. Future research will focus on integrating genomic data with other omics data, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, to achieve even greater precision in cancer diagnosis and treatment.
