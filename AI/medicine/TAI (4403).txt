Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, driven by continuous evolution in instrumentation and techniques.  Early laparoscopic approaches, limited by two-dimensional visualization and inflexible instruments, have yielded to sophisticated robotic platforms offering enhanced dexterity and three-dimensional imaging.  This evolution has expanded the scope of MIS, enabling complex procedures previously confined to open surgery.  Technological advancements, including the development of smaller diameter instruments, advanced energy sources (e.g., ultrasonic, laser), and improved suture materials, have further minimized invasiveness, reducing patient trauma and improving outcomes. Concurrent advances in surgical simulation and augmented reality technologies enhance surgical training and improve procedural precision. While challenges remain, particularly concerning cost-effectiveness and accessibility, ongoing research focuses on refining existing techniques, exploring novel approaches such as single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), and developing artificial intelligence-assisted systems for enhanced precision and automation.  Future directions emphasize personalized surgery informed by pre-operative imaging and intraoperative data analysis to further optimize patient outcomes and broaden the application of MIS across a wider range of surgical specialties.
