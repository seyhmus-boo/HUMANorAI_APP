Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health globally.  This abstract summarizes the complex interplay between a changing climate and human health outcomes. Rising temperatures are directly associated with increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns exacerbate the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, while extreme weather events such as floods and hurricanes cause injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences.  Furthermore, climate change impacts food security and water resources, leading to malnutrition and infectious disease outbreaks.  Indirect effects include increased air pollution, exacerbated by wildfires and changes in atmospheric stability, contributing to respiratory illnesses.  Studies consistently demonstrate a correlation between climate change indicators and escalating healthcare burdens, including increased hospital admissions and mortality rates.  Addressing climate change through mitigation and adaptation strategies is crucial for protecting public health.  Future research should focus on refining predictive models, improving surveillance systems for climate-sensitive diseases, and developing effective public health interventions to minimize the escalating health impacts of a changing climate.
