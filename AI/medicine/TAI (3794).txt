Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding and effective mitigation. This research paper explores the complex and intertwined relationship between climate change and its cascading impacts on human health, transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries.  While traditionally viewed through the lens of environmental science and epidemiology, the issue necessitates incorporating perspectives from economics, sociology, political science, and psychology to fully grasp its intricate nature.  We will examine the direct effects of climate change, such as increased heat-related illnesses, the spread of infectious diseases via altered vector distributions, and the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to air pollution.  Furthermore, we will analyze the indirect impacts, including mental health consequences stemming from displacement, food insecurity, and trauma related to extreme weather events.  By integrating insights from diverse fields, this paper aims to illuminate the intricate web of causation linking climate change to public health outcomes and highlight the crucial need for interdisciplinary collaboration in developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect vulnerable populations.
