Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This presentation explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human well-being, focusing on key pathways of impact.  We will examine the direct effects of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and wildfires, on morbidity and mortality, including increases in injuries, respiratory illnesses, and infectious disease outbreaks.  Furthermore, we will address the indirect consequences, encompassing the impact on food security, water resources, and vector-borne disease transmission.  Changes in air quality resulting from increased wildfire smoke and other pollutants will also be discussed, highlighting their contribution to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.  The presentation will then briefly review the existing literature on the social determinants of health and their exacerbation by climate change, emphasizing vulnerability disparities across different populations.  Finally, we will briefly discuss adaptation and mitigation strategies to minimize the adverse health impacts of climate change, including both individual and societal interventions.  The presentation aims to underscore the urgency of addressing climate change not merely as an environmental issue, but as a critical public health imperative.
