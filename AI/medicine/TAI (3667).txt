Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a profound and multifaceted global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  This presentation will explore the complex interplay of factors contributing to the escalating crisis, highlighting the urgent need for collaboration across scientific disciplines.  We will examine the ecological drivers of AR, including the dissemination of resistance genes within and between microbial populations in diverse environments, such as healthcare settings, agriculture, and wastewater systems.  The presentation will then delve into the socio-economic implications of AR, focusing on the escalating healthcare costs, diminished treatment efficacy, and potential for societal destabilization resulting from untreatable infections.  Finally, we will discuss the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing this challenge, emphasizing the need for integrated approaches encompassing microbiology, epidemiology, public health, veterinary medicine, environmental science, social sciences, and policy-making.  Successful strategies require not only innovative research into novel antibiotics and diagnostics but also the implementation of effective stewardship programs, improved infection control practices, and public awareness campaigns to foster responsible antibiotic use.  The presentation will conclude by advocating for a strengthened global collaborative framework to combat this critical public health threat.
