Cancer's genetic basis, once a theoretical notion, is now central to our understanding and treatment.  Early research, focusing on chromosomal abnormalities like the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia, hinted at the involvement of specific genes in oncogenesis.  However, the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies revolutionized the field.  We now recognize cancer as a disease driven by somatic mutations affecting a multitude of genes, including oncogenes promoting uncontrolled growth and tumor suppressor genes whose inactivation removes crucial cellular brakes.  This genetic heterogeneity explains the vast diversity of cancers and their responses to therapies.

This understanding has fueled the rise of personalized medicine.  Analyzing a patient's tumor genome allows clinicians to identify specific driver mutations, informing the selection of targeted therapies.  For instance, patients with EGFR mutations in lung cancer respond well to EGFR inhibitors, whereas those without do not.  While challenges remain, including the complexity of interpreting genomic data and the emergence of drug resistance, advances in genomic sequencing and bioinformatics continue to refine our ability to tailor cancer treatments, ultimately improving patient outcomes and prognosis.
