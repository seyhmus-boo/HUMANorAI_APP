Cancer is a complex disease driven by genetic alterations accumulating within somatic cells.  Understanding the precise genetic underpinnings of individual cancers is paramount for developing effective, personalized therapies.  This review examines recent advances in elucidating the genetic basis of cancer, focusing on their translation into personalized medicine approaches. We discuss the role of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in identifying diverse somatic mutations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions and deletions (indels), copy number variations (CNVs), and structural rearrangements, across a range of cancer types.  Furthermore, we explore the integration of genomic data with clinical information to predict prognosis, guide treatment selection, and monitor disease progression.  The clinical utility of targeted therapies, immunotherapy informed by genetic profiling (e.g., tumor mutational burden assessment), and the challenges associated with implementing personalized oncology, including cost-effectiveness and access to advanced technologies, are critically analyzed. This review highlights the transformative potential of genomics in refining cancer care and underscores the ongoing need for further research to optimize the precision and accessibility of personalized cancer medicine.
