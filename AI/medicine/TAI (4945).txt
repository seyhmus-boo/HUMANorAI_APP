Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting key advancements and their practical applications.  Early MIS relied heavily on laparoscopy, employing rigid instruments and limited dexterity.  We will examine the transition from this paradigm to the emergence of robotic surgery, enabling enhanced precision and articulation through intuitive interfaces.  Further advancements, such as single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), aim to minimize invasiveness even further, although their wider adoption is currently limited by technological challenges and specific anatomical constraints.  The presentation will also explore the integration of advanced imaging techniques, including 3D imaging and augmented reality, which improve visualization and surgical planning, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.  We will discuss the practical applications of these evolving techniques across diverse surgical specialties, such as general surgery, urology, and gynecology, providing examples of their impact on specific procedures and patient populations. Finally, future directions in MIS, including the potential of artificial intelligence and nanotechnology, will be briefly considered.
