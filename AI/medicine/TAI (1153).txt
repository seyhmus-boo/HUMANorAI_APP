Organ transplantation, a life-saving medical marvel, remains ethically complex despite significant advancements.  This paper examines the persistent ethical challenges surrounding organ procurement and allocation, particularly in light of recent developments in areas such as xenotransplantation and 3D bioprinting. The increasing demand for organs globally far outstrips supply, necessitating ongoing debate regarding equitable allocation systems and the potential for exploitation of vulnerable populations.  While presumed consent legislation aims to increase organ availability, concerns regarding informed consent and potential coercion persist.  Moreover, the emergence of xenotransplantation, using animal organs for human transplantation, introduces a new layer of ethical considerations surrounding animal welfare, the risk of zoonotic diseases, and the potential for unforeseen long-term consequences. The development of 3D bioprinted organs, although promising, presents further ethical dilemmas concerning accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and the potential for exacerbating existing health disparities. This research will critically analyse these recent advancements, examining their implications for existing ethical frameworks and proposing potential avenues for navigating the complex moral landscape of organ transplantation.
