Organ transplantation offers a life-saving intervention for individuals with end-stage organ failure, yet its implementation is fraught with complex ethical dilemmas. This paper explores the multifaceted ethical considerations inherent in the organ transplantation process, focusing on three key areas: equitable allocation of scarce resources, the ethical implications of living donation, and the potential for exploitation and coercion in organ procurement.  We analyze existing ethical frameworks and guidelines, examining their strengths and limitations in addressing the challenges posed by increasing demand and evolving medical technologies.  Specifically, we investigate the tensions between utilitarian and deontological approaches to resource allocation, the balance between individual autonomy and the well-being of potential living donors, and the safeguards needed to prevent vulnerable populations from being disproportionately affected by organ procurement practices.  Through a critical review of relevant literature and case studies, this paper aims to illuminate the persistent ethical challenges in organ transplantation and to propose potential avenues for improving the fairness, transparency, and integrity of this crucial medical field.
