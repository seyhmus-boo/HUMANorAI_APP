Minimally invasive surgical techniques have undergone a dramatic evolution, significantly improving patient outcomes and reducing postoperative morbidity.  This review summarizes key advancements, tracing their trajectory from early laparoscopic procedures to the current landscape of robotic surgery and advanced imaging modalities.  Initial laparoscopic approaches, while revolutionary, were limited by dexterity and visualization constraints.  Technological improvements, including enhanced instrumentation, high-definition cameras, and improved energy sources, addressed these limitations, expanding the scope of laparoscopic surgery.  The introduction of robotic surgery provided further refinements, offering increased precision, dexterity, and ergonomic advantages for surgeons.  Simultaneously, advances in imaging technologies, such as 3D laparoscopy and intraoperative ultrasound, have significantly improved surgical visualization and planning.  While challenges remain, such as the learning curve associated with new technologies and the cost of implementation,  the ongoing evolution towards smaller incisions, enhanced precision, and improved patient recovery underscores the transformative impact of minimally invasive surgery. Future directions likely involve the integration of artificial intelligence and augmented reality for further advancements in surgical precision and training.
