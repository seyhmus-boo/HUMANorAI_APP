Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, demanding urgent attention to both its clinical management and fundamental research.  This abstract highlights critical experimental challenges hindering progress in combating AR.  While *in vitro* studies readily demonstrate resistance mechanisms, translating these findings into effective *in vivo* strategies remains problematic.  The complex interplay between bacterial populations, host immunity, and the microbiome complicates the development of accurate predictive models for resistance emergence and spread.  Furthermore,  the lack of standardized methodologies for evaluating antibiotic efficacy across diverse bacterial species and clinical settings impedes the comparison and interpretation of experimental data.  High-throughput screening methods, while promising, require significant refinement to accommodate the diverse genetic backgrounds and environmental conditions influencing AR development.   Finally, funding limitations and the need for interdisciplinary collaborations pose significant barriers to addressing the multifaceted nature of this global challenge.  Overcoming these experimental obstacles is paramount to developing novel strategies for preventing and treating infections in the era of escalating AR.
