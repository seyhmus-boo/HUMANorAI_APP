Organ transplantation, a life-saving medical intervention, is fraught with complex ethical dilemmas demanding interdisciplinary scrutiny.  This paper explores the multifaceted ethical considerations inherent in organ procurement, allocation, and transplantation, highlighting the crucial interplay between medicine, law, philosophy, and sociology.  The scarcity of donor organs necessitates difficult choices regarding allocation, raising questions of justice, fairness, and the potential for discrimination based on factors like socioeconomic status, race, or age.  Furthermore, the process of organ procurement itself raises ethical concerns surrounding informed consent, particularly in cases of deceased donation and the potential for coercion of families during emotionally charged situations.  The paper will examine the evolving legal frameworks designed to navigate these challenges, including legislation concerning presumed consent and the regulation of organ trafficking.  Finally, it will analyze the sociological implications, such as the impact of organ donation on grieving families and the broader societal perceptions of death and the body.  By integrating perspectives from these diverse disciplines, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the ethical landscape surrounding organ transplantation and contribute to more equitable and just practices.
