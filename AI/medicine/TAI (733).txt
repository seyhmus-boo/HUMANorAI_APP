This presentation explores the evolution of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques through a novel lens: the quantum mechanical principles underlying technological advancements.  While seemingly disparate, quantum mechanics underpins the development of crucial MIS technologies.  From the precise control afforded by laser scalpel systems, leveraging stimulated emission, to the increasingly sophisticated imaging modalities such as MRI and advanced endoscopy relying on quantum phenomena in light-matter interactions, the advancements are intrinsically linked to quantum effects.  We will discuss how improvements in material science, facilitated by quantum computational modelling, have led to the creation of smaller, more durable instruments and biocompatible materials.  Furthermore, the development of advanced sensor technology, enabling real-time monitoring and feedback during MIS, draws heavily on quantum principles in electronic sensing and signal processing. The presentation will analyze the historical trajectory of these technological developments, highlighting the quantum underpinnings that have propelled the transition from open surgery to minimally invasive approaches, leading to enhanced precision, reduced invasiveness, and improved patient outcomes. Finally, we will speculate on future directions in MIS, driven by emerging quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and quantum computing.
