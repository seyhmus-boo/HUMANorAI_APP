Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery times, represents a significant advancement in surgical practice.  This paper examines the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, tracing its development from nascent stages to the sophisticated procedures employed today.  Early attempts at minimally invasive approaches, though limited by technology, laid crucial groundwork.  The pioneering work of pioneers like Jacques Palfray, with his pioneering use of endoscopes in the early 20th century, provided the initial impetus for exploring less invasive surgical options.  However, the true revolution arrived with advancements in fiber optics, laparoscopy, and imaging technology during the latter half of the 20th century. These advancements enabled surgeons to visualize and manipulate internal organs through smaller access points, leading to the widespread adoption of laparoscopic techniques across various surgical specialities.  This paper will explore the subsequent development of robotic surgery, single-port access surgery, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), highlighting the technological innovations and surgical refinements driving continuous improvements in patient outcomes and procedural efficacy.  Furthermore, we will analyze the ongoing challenges and future directions in MIS, including the integration of artificial intelligence and virtual reality technologies.
