Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health. This review synthesizes existing literature demonstrating the complex interplay between a changing climate and various health outcomes.  Rising temperatures are directly implicated in increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, while extreme weather events such as floods and droughts lead to injuries, displacement, and subsequent mental health challenges.  Furthermore, altered agricultural practices and food security issues stemming from climate change impact nutritional status and contribute to malnutrition-related diseases.  Air pollution, exacerbated by climate change, exacerbates respiratory illnesses.  While the evidence base robustly supports a negative relationship between climate change and public health, significant geographical variation exists in the specific impacts and vulnerabilities.  Addressing this complex challenge requires integrated strategies encompassing mitigation efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation measures to bolster resilience and healthcare systems. Future research should prioritize exploring the long-term, cumulative impacts and developing targeted interventions for vulnerable communities.
