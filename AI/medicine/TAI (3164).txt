Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a rapidly escalating global threat to human and animal health, undermining the efficacy of life-saving treatments for infectious diseases.  The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics in human medicine, veterinary practice, and agriculture has driven the selection and dissemination of resistant pathogens, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs worldwide. This review examines the multifaceted nature of AR, exploring its complex interplay of ecological, social, and economic factors. We analyze the key mechanisms driving resistance development, including horizontal gene transfer and mutations, and discuss the diverse range of resistant bacterial species contributing to the global burden of infectious disease.  Furthermore, we evaluate the current landscape of AR surveillance and control strategies, highlighting the challenges in implementing effective interventions across diverse healthcare systems and settings.  Finally, we consider the urgent need for integrated, multi-sectoral approaches involving policy changes, improved stewardship programs, the development of novel therapeutics, and the promotion of alternative infection control strategies to mitigate the escalating threat of AR and safeguard global health security.
