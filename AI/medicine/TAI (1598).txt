Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a critical global threat, demanding innovative approaches beyond classical medicinal chemistry.  This abstract explores the potential of quantum mechanical (QM) methods to address this challenge.  Current drug discovery heavily relies on empirical methods, often failing to capture the subtle complexities of protein-ligand interactions crucial for effective antibiotic design.  QM calculations, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock methods, offer a powerful alternative.  These techniques can elucidate the electronic structure and energetics of antibiotic-enzyme complexes, revealing binding mechanisms and facilitating the identification of resistance mutations at the atomic level.  Furthermore, QM/MM simulations can bridge the gap between the quantum realm of electronic interactions and the classical mechanics of larger biological systems, providing insights into the dynamic aspects of antibiotic action.  By accurately modeling the intricate interactions involved in AR mechanisms, QM methods can guide the rational design of novel antibiotics targeting resistant strains, enabling the prediction of efficacy and potential resistance development. This approach holds promise for circumventing the limitations of traditional drug discovery, offering a more precise and efficient pathway toward combating the global crisis of antibiotic resistance.  Future work will focus on scaling QM methods to enable high-throughput screening and exploration of large chemical spaces.
