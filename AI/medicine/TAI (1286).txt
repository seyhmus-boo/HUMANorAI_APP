This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the genetic basis of cancer and their translation into personalized medicine.  Significant progress has been made in identifying driver mutations across various cancer types, leveraging high-throughput sequencing technologies and bioinformatic analyses. This has led to the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, showing improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapies.  However, challenges remain, including the heterogeneity of cancer genomes, the emergence of drug resistance, and the identification of effective biomarkers for patient stratification.  Further research is needed to fully elucidate the complex interplay between genetic alterations, tumor microenvironment, and patient-specific factors.  Advances in liquid biopsies and minimally invasive diagnostic tools hold promise for earlier detection and real-time monitoring of treatment response.  Overall, despite existing limitations, the integration of genomic data into clinical practice is revolutionizing cancer care, paving the way for truly personalized and precision oncology strategies with improved patient outcomes.  Future directions include the development of more sophisticated predictive models and the incorporation of artificial intelligence to optimize treatment selection and enhance therapeutic efficacy.
