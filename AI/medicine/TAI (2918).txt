This presentation explores the burgeoning field of nutrigenomics and its implications for chronic disease prevention.  Recent advancements highlight the intricate interplay between diet, gene expression, and the development of conditions like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.  We will review emerging evidence demonstrating the impact of specific dietary components, including polyphenols, omega-3 fatty acids, and pre/probiotics, on modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiota composition â€“ all crucial factors in chronic disease pathogenesis.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the limitations of current nutritional guidelines and the need for personalized nutritional strategies based on individual genetic predispositions and metabolomic profiles.  Recent breakthroughs in metabolomics and bioinformatics are enabling the development of more precise and effective dietary interventions tailored to individual risk profiles.  Finally, we will discuss ongoing research focusing on the long-term efficacy and cost-effectiveness of nutrition-based preventative strategies, and the ethical implications of personalized nutrition in healthcare.
