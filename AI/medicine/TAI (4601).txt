Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat to public health, undermining modern medicine and jeopardizing sustainable development goals.  This presentation will explore the multifaceted nature of AR, examining its complex interplay of microbial evolution, human behavior, and environmental factors. We will review the major drivers of AR, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, inadequate infection prevention and control practices, and the dissemination of resistance genes through various environmental pathways.  The global implications of AR will be discussed, highlighting its significant impact on healthcare systems, economic productivity, and social equity. Increased healthcare costs, prolonged hospital stays, and heightened mortality rates directly attributable to AR will be examined.  Further, the presentation will address current strategies to combat AR, focusing on the urgent need for responsible antibiotic stewardship, the development and implementation of novel antimicrobial therapies, and the advancement of diagnostic tools for rapid and accurate detection of resistant pathogens.  Finally, we will emphasize the crucial role of international collaboration and multi-sectoral approaches in mitigating the global threat of AR and securing a future where effective antimicrobials remain readily available.
