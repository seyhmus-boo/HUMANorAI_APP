Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting crucial regulatory pathways controlling cell growth and apoptosis.  Advances in genomic sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, revealing distinct mutational signatures across cancer types and even within individual tumors. This heterogeneity underlies the limitations of traditional, "one-size-fits-all" cancer treatments.  Personalized medicine leverages this knowledge by employing genomic profiling to identify specific driver mutations in a patient's tumor. This information informs treatment selection, enabling targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for specific oncogenic mutations or immunotherapy leveraging neoantigen recognition.  Furthermore,  liquid biopsies, analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), offer minimally invasive approaches for monitoring treatment response and detecting recurrence.  Ongoing research focuses on integrating multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) to refine risk stratification, predict treatment response, and develop novel therapeutic strategies tailored to individual patient genetic profiles, ultimately aiming to improve cancer prognosis and patient outcomes.
