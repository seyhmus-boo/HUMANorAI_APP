Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant threat to global health security, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation. This presentation will explore the multifaceted nature of AR, highlighting the crucial interconnections between various fields.  We will examine the epidemiological dynamics of AR spread, emphasizing the role of environmental reservoirs,  including wastewater and agricultural runoff, in driving resistance gene dissemination.  Furthermore, we will discuss the societal implications, focusing on the economic burden of treatment failures and the potential for increased mortality rates. This necessitates collaboration beyond healthcare, including contributions from agricultural scientists investigating antibiotic use in livestock, environmental engineers developing innovative wastewater treatment strategies, and social scientists addressing antibiotic stewardship and public health awareness campaigns. The presentation will argue that a holistic understanding of AR, achieved through strengthened interdisciplinary collaborations and data sharing, is crucial for developing and implementing effective control strategies.  We will conclude by highlighting promising interdisciplinary research avenues for tackling this complex and pressing global challenge.
