Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window of vulnerability for the onset of mental health disorders.  Historically, adolescent mental health received comparatively little attention, often overshadowed by concerns surrounding physical development and adult-onset conditions.  Early conceptualizations lacked the nuanced understanding we possess today, frequently conflating adolescent emotional turmoil with pathology or attributing it solely to familial dysfunction.  However,  a growing body of research over the past few decades has revealed a concerning rise in prevalence rates across a range of disorders, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse, demanding a comprehensive reassessment of our understanding and approaches to treatment.  This paper examines contemporary trends in adolescent mental health disorders, focusing on the shifting epidemiological landscape, the influence of socio-cultural factors, and the evolving landscape of evidence-based treatments.  We will critically analyze the effectiveness of various therapeutic interventions, including pharmacological and psychosocial approaches, while also addressing persistent challenges in access to timely and appropriate care, particularly within marginalized communities.  Finally, we will explore future directions in research and clinical practice needed to address this critical public health issue.
