Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.  This abstract highlights the complex interplay between climate change and various health outcomes, requiring collaboration across disciplines such as epidemiology, climatology, public health policy, and social sciences.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, while altered precipitation patterns influence the incidence of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever.  Extreme weather events, amplified by climate change, lead to injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences.  Furthermore, changes in air quality, influenced by both climate variability and pollution, contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  Food insecurity, water scarcity, and ecosystem disruptions further exacerbate health vulnerabilities, particularly within vulnerable populations.  Interdisciplinary research is crucial for accurately modeling climate change's impact on health, developing effective early warning systems, and designing targeted interventions.  This includes integrating climate data into epidemiological models, incorporating social determinants of health into vulnerability assessments, and promoting climate-resilient public health infrastructure.  Addressing this complex challenge requires collaborative efforts to ensure equitable and sustainable health outcomes in a changing climate.
