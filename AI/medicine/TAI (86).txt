Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant global public health concern, with prevalence rates increasing over recent decades. Historically, adolescent mental health was largely neglected, often overlooked or attributed to typical developmental phases.  Early conceptualizations focused primarily on psychosomatic illnesses, with limited understanding of distinct disorders like depression and anxiety.  The latter half of the 20th century witnessed a shift towards more specific diagnostic criteria and recognition of the unique vulnerabilities of adolescents.  Current trends show a rising incidence of anxiety, depression, and self-harm, exacerbated by societal factors such as increased academic pressure, social media influence, and socioeconomic inequalities.  Treatment approaches have evolved from predominantly institutionalization to a broader range encompassing pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy (including cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy), and family-based interventions.  However, significant disparities persist in access to evidence-based care, particularly for underserved populations.  Future research should focus on early intervention strategies, addressing the underlying social determinants of mental health, and developing culturally sensitive and readily accessible treatments to effectively mitigate the growing burden of adolescent mental health disorders.
