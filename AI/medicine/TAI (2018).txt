Adolescents experience a disproportionately high prevalence of mental health disorders, a trend exacerbated by societal factors such as increased screen time and social media pressures.  Anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder, and mood disorders, primarily depression and bipolar disorder, comprise a significant portion of diagnosed conditions.  Eating disorders, substance use disorders, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) also demonstrate notable prevalence rates during this developmental stage.  Treatment approaches are multifaceted and often necessitate a holistic strategy.  Evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are frequently utilized for anxiety and mood disorders, while medication, typically antidepressants or mood stabilizers, may be prescribed in conjunction with therapy.  Family-based interventions are crucial, given the significant impact on family dynamics.  Early identification and intervention are paramount to improve long-term outcomes and minimize the potential for chronic illness and functional impairment.  Further research is warranted to explore the long-term effects of emerging digital therapeutics and refine treatment protocols based on individual needs and cultural contexts.
