Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIST) have revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of MIST, highlighting key advancements from early laparoscopic procedures to the sophisticated robotic and single-port approaches currently employed.  We will examine the technological drivers behind this evolution, focusing on the development of smaller instruments, high-definition imaging systems, and advanced energy sources.  The transition from rigid to flexible endoscopes, and the integration of robotics enabling enhanced dexterity and precision, will be discussed.  Practical applications across diverse surgical specialties will be explored, including examples in cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery, and urological procedures.  The presentation will further consider the ongoing challenges, such as the learning curve associated with advanced techniques and the limitations imposed by anatomical constraints. Finally, we will briefly discuss emerging trends, such as augmented reality and artificial intelligence, and their potential to further refine and broaden the scope of MIST in the future. This overview aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive understanding of the remarkable progress and future directions within this rapidly evolving field.
