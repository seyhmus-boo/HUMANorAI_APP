Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgery, driven by advancements in instrumentation, imaging, and surgical understanding.  Early MIS procedures, primarily laparoscopy, relied on rigid endoscopes and limited dexterity.  Evolutionary progress involved the introduction of flexible endoscopes, enhanced visualization through high-definition cameras and 3D imaging, and the development of sophisticated robotic platforms offering improved precision and ergonomics.  These advancements have expanded the range of feasible MIS procedures, transitioning from simple appendectomies to complex cardiac and neurological interventions.  The adoption of energy-based devices like lasers and ultrasonic shears has improved tissue dissection and hemostasis, minimizing bleeding and operative time.  Simultaneously, advancements in suture technology and knot-tying techniques have refined precision and improved cosmetic outcomes.  Practical applications are diverse, impacting patient outcomes across various surgical specialities: reduced post-operative pain and scarring, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and ultimately, improved patient quality of life.  Ongoing research focuses on improving robotic dexterity, integrating augmented reality, and developing novel minimally invasive approaches,  continuously pushing the boundaries of surgical capability and safety.
