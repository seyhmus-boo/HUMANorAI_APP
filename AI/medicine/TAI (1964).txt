Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, with disorders often misdiagnosed or attributed to typical teenage angst.  However, recent decades have witnessed a surge in research highlighting the prevalence and significant impact of mental health disorders in this population.  Trends indicate rising rates of anxiety and depression, particularly among girls, alongside increasing diagnoses of eating disorders and self-harm behaviors.  Contributing factors are complex and multifaceted, encompassing societal pressures, technological influences, genetic predispositions, and family dynamics.  

Treatment approaches have evolved from primarily psychodynamic therapies to encompass a broader range of evidence-based interventions.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are now widely used for anxiety and mood disorders, demonstrating efficacy in managing symptoms and improving functional outcomes.  Pharmacotherapy plays a crucial role, particularly for severe conditions, though its use requires careful consideration of potential side effects and long-term implications.  Integrated approaches, combining psychotherapy with medication and family-based interventions, are increasingly favored for optimal outcomes.  Further research is needed to address disparities in access to care and to develop culturally sensitive interventions that effectively address the unique needs of diverse adolescent populations.
