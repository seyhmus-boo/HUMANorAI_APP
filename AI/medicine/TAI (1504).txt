Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transition, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and development of mental health disorders.  This paper explores emerging trends in the prevalence and manifestation of these disorders among adolescents, highlighting the urgent need for effective and accessible treatments.  While specific disorders such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse are individually significant, their interconnectedness underscores the limitations of discipline-specific approaches. This research emphasizes the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing the complexity of adolescent mental health.  We will examine how insights from psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience, sociology, and public health can be integrated to improve both diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy.  This interdisciplinary lens is crucial because adolescent mental health is shaped by a confluence of biological predispositions, environmental factors, and social determinants, demanding a holistic and integrated approach.  The paper concludes by considering the implications of these findings for future research directions and the development of more comprehensive and effective mental health services for this vulnerable population.
