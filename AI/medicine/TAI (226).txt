Chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers, represent a significant global health burden, placing immense strain on healthcare systems and impacting individual quality of life.  While genetic predisposition plays a role, mounting evidence strongly implicates nutrition as a crucial modifiable risk factor in their prevention. This research paper explores the multifaceted influence of nutrition on chronic disease prevention, highlighting the critical interdisciplinary nature of this field.  We move beyond a solely biomedical approach, integrating perspectives from nutrition science, epidemiology, public health, sociology, and economics to achieve a holistic understanding.  This interdisciplinary framework allows for a comprehensive examination of the complex interplay between dietary patterns, individual behaviours, socio-economic factors, and the resulting impact on chronic disease incidence and prevalence.  By considering the social determinants of health alongside biological mechanisms, this paper aims to contribute to a more nuanced and effective strategy for chronic disease prevention through targeted nutritional interventions and public health policies.  Specifically, we will investigate the role of specific macronutrients and micronutrients, exploring their impact on inflammation, oxidative stress, and metabolic processes implicated in chronic disease development.
