Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's ability to treat bacterial infections.  This review summarizes the multifaceted nature of AR, encompassing the underlying mechanisms of resistance development, the contributing factors driving its proliferation, and the profound implications for global health and socioeconomic stability.  Overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, fuel the selection and dissemination of resistant strains.  The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly in healthcare settings, presents a critical challenge, rendering infections increasingly difficult and costly to manage.  The consequences extend beyond direct mortality and morbidity, encompassing increased healthcare expenditures, prolonged hospital stays, and reduced agricultural productivity.  Effective mitigation strategies require a multi-pronged approach, encompassing stringent antibiotic stewardship programs, enhanced surveillance systems, the development of novel antimicrobial therapies, and a global commitment to improving sanitation and hygiene.  Failure to address AR will result in a return to a pre-antibiotic era, with devastating consequences for global health security.
