Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has undergone significant evolution, profoundly impacting modern healthcare delivery.  Recent developments demonstrate its increasing integration into mainstream medicine, driven by technological advancements and evolving patient needs.  High-bandwidth internet access and sophisticated mobile applications facilitate remote patient monitoring (RPM), allowing for continuous data collection on vital signs and activity levels, leading to proactive intervention and improved disease management, particularly for chronic conditions.  Furthermore, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are enhancing diagnostic accuracy through image analysis and predictive modelling, supplementing clinician expertise.  However, challenges remain, including addressing digital health literacy disparities, ensuring data security and privacy compliance under evolving regulations like HIPAA, and overcoming reimbursement hurdles for telehealth services.  Despite these obstacles, the burgeoning field of virtual care, encompassing telehealth, telemonitoring, and mHealth, continues to demonstrate potential for enhancing accessibility, efficiency, and affordability within healthcare systems globally, particularly in underserved areas. Future research will focus on optimizing these technologies and mitigating identified limitations to maximize the transformative impact of telemedicine.
