Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and mitigating its impacts.  This abstract highlights the complex interplay between environmental changes and human health outcomes, necessitating collaboration across disciplines including climatology, epidemiology, public health, social sciences, and economics.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, while altered precipitation patterns increase the risk of waterborne diseases and vector-borne infections like malaria and dengue fever.  Changes in air quality, driven by increased wildfires and pollution, contribute to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease.  Furthermore, extreme weather events like floods and hurricanes cause injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences.  Social vulnerability, influenced by socioeconomic factors and geographical location, exacerbates these health risks, with marginalized communities disproportionately affected.  Effective interventions necessitate integrated strategies that combine climate change mitigation efforts with public health preparedness and adaptation planning, encompassing surveillance systems, early warning mechanisms, and resource allocation informed by robust epidemiological modeling and social impact assessments.  Strengthening interdisciplinary collaborations is crucial for developing and implementing effective policies to protect public health in a changing climate.
