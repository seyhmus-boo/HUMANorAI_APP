This presentation explores emerging trends in adolescent mental health disorders through the lens of quantum-like cognitive models.  While acknowledging the limitations of directly applying quantum mechanics to the brain, we argue that the principles of superposition and entanglement offer valuable conceptual frameworks for understanding the complex, interconnected nature of adolescent mental states.  We will examine how these principles might illuminate the observed increase in anxiety and depression diagnoses, suggesting that fluctuating, coexisting emotional states (superposition) and the intricate interplay between cognitive, emotional, and social factors (entanglement) contribute to the development and persistence of these disorders.  Traditional treatment approaches, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and medication, will be reviewed within this quantum-inspired framework.  Specifically, we will discuss how CBT might be interpreted as a process of decoherence, reducing the superposition of conflicting mental states towards a more coherent, stable self-representation.  Finally, we will explore the potential of novel therapeutic interventions inspired by quantum principles,  such as techniques aimed at promoting constructive interference between positive emotional states, and propose avenues for future research leveraging this novel perspective to improve the understanding and treatment of adolescent mental health challenges.
