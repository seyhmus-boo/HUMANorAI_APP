Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.  This abstract highlights the complex interplay between environmental shifts and human well-being, drawing connections across disciplines such as epidemiology, climatology, sociology, and economics.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly impacting vulnerable populations. Changes in precipitation patterns influence the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, necessitating integrated epidemiological surveillance and public health interventions.  Furthermore, extreme weather events such as floods and droughts cause displacement, injury, and mental health consequences, demanding collaborative efforts from disaster management and mental health specialists.  Food insecurity, resulting from altered agricultural yields, contributes to malnutrition and associated health problems, emphasizing the crucial link between climate change, food systems, and nutritional epidemiology.  Addressing this complex challenge necessitates integrated research, combining climate models with epidemiological data to project future health risks, alongside policy interventions that promote climate resilience and equitable access to healthcare.  Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial to build effective strategies that protect public health from the escalating impacts of climate change.
