Adolescents experience a significant burden of mental health disorders (MHDs), with rising prevalence rates observed globally for conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  This increase necessitates an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and addressing these complex issues.  Trends indicate a growing influence of societal factors, including social media usage and academic pressure, on adolescent mental wellbeing, highlighting the need for collaboration between psychiatrists, psychologists, sociologists, and educators.  Effective treatment requires integration of various modalities. While pharmacological interventions play a role, particularly for severe cases, psychotherapy, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), demonstrate significant efficacy.  Furthermore, family-based interventions and school-based programs addressing preventative measures and early intervention are crucial.  Future research should focus on refining diagnostic tools tailored to adolescent developmental stages, improving access to evidence-based treatments across diverse populations, and strengthening interdisciplinary collaborations to implement comprehensive and sustainable mental healthcare strategies for adolescents.  A holistic approach acknowledging the interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors is essential for optimal outcomes.
