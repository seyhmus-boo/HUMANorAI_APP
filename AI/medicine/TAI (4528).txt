Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This paper examines the complex and evolving relationship between climate change and its impacts on human health, moving beyond simple correlations to explore nuanced pathways of influence.  We analyze the direct effects of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and wildfires, on morbidity and mortality,  considering both immediate impacts and long-term consequences like displacement and mental health issues.  Furthermore, we investigate the indirect effects of climate change, including changes in the geographic distribution and prevalence of vector-borne diseases, the alteration of air and water quality, and the exacerbation of food insecurity and malnutrition.  The paper synthesizes existing literature, utilizing a framework that distinguishes between acute and chronic health impacts, while acknowledging the significant influence of socioeconomic factors and existing health disparities in determining vulnerability to climate change-related health risks.  Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for public health policy and intervention strategies aimed at mitigating the adverse health effects of climate change and building climate-resilient healthcare systems.
