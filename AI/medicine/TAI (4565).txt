Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's capacity to treat bacterial infections.  This presentation addresses the substantial experimental challenges hindering effective AR research and mitigation strategies.  Current *in vitro* susceptibility testing, while widely used, poorly reflects the complex *in vivo* environment, leading to discrepancies between laboratory findings and clinical outcomes.  Moreover, the development of novel antibiotics faces considerable hurdles, including high development costs, limited market incentives, and the emergence of resistance mechanisms even to newly introduced drugs.  Investigating the complex interplay between bacterial evolution, host immunity, and the microbiome presents further challenges, requiring sophisticated multi-omics approaches and advanced animal models that accurately replicate human infection dynamics.  Finally, the effective translation of research findings into public health policy and interventions is hampered by limitations in surveillance, data sharing, and the implementation of global stewardship programs.  Addressing these experimental challenges necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, combining innovative technologies with collaborative global initiatives to combat the escalating crisis of AR.
