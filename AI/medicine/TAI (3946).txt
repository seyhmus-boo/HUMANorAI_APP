Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are complex and multifaceted, demanding careful navigation of competing moral imperatives.  This presentation explores key ethical dilemmas within the field, utilizing accessible analogies to illuminate the intricacies.  The allocation of scarce organs, for instance, resembles a lifeboat scenario – limited resources must be distributed fairly amongst desperate claimants, raising questions of merit-based versus egalitarian approaches.  We will examine the challenges of prioritizing patients based on factors like age, lifestyle choices, or societal contribution, drawing parallels to resource allocation in disaster relief.

Further, the concept of informed consent, often complex in the context of organ donation, can be likened to a contract negotiation – ensuring true understanding and voluntary agreement from the donor (or their surrogate) is paramount, even in emotionally charged situations.  Finally, the potential for coercion and exploitation within living donation necessitates a framework mirroring consumer protection laws, safeguarding vulnerable individuals from undue pressure. This presentation will offer a framework for understanding these challenges, using these analogies to facilitate critical discussion and explore potential solutions for promoting ethical practices in organ transplantation.
