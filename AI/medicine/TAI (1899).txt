Vaccination represents a cornerstone of public health, profoundly impacting the prevention of infectious diseases throughout history.  Early methods, such as variolation against smallpox in ancient China and 18th-century England, demonstrated the principle of inducing immunity through exposure to a weakened form of the pathogen.  Edward Jenner's pioneering work with cowpox in the late 18th century provided a safer and more effective approach, laying the foundation for modern vaccinology.

Modern vaccines exploit the body's immune system by introducing antigens – either weakened or inactivated pathogens, or their components – to stimulate an immune response.  This response involves the production of antibodies and memory B and T cells, providing long-term protection against future encounters with the pathogen.  By achieving herd immunity, where a significant portion of the population is vaccinated, the transmission of infectious diseases is significantly reduced, safeguarding even those who cannot be vaccinated due to medical reasons.  The eradication of smallpox stands as a testament to vaccination's power, while ongoing vaccination programs continue to control numerous life-threatening diseases like polio, measles, and influenza, thereby drastically reducing morbidity and mortality globally.
