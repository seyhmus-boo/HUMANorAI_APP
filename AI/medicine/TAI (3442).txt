Antibiotic resistance, the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of antimicrobial drugs, poses a significant and escalating global threat.  Its historical roots trace back to the discovery of penicillin in the 1920s, initiating widespread antibiotic use that inadvertently propelled the selection and evolution of resistant strains.  Over decades, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, alongside agricultural practices, have accelerated the dissemination of resistance genes, both horizontally and vertically.  Currently, multidrug-resistant bacteria, including *Enterobacteriaceae*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, and *Acinetobacter baumannii*, are prevalent worldwide, rendering common infections untreatable and increasing morbidity and mortality.  The global implications are profound, encompassing escalating healthcare costs, prolonged hospital stays, and diminished effectiveness of surgical procedures.  Addressing this crisis requires a multifaceted approach encompassing improved stewardship programs, development of novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapies,  enhanced surveillance systems, and robust infection control measures.  Failure to implement effective strategies will result in a return to a pre-antibiotic era, with devastating consequences for global health security.
