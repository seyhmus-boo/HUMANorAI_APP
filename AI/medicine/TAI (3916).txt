Climate change significantly impacts public health through multifaceted pathways. Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations. Altered precipitation patterns increase the risk of waterborne diseases and vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever.  Extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, displace populations, disrupt healthcare systems, and create conditions conducive to infectious disease outbreaks.  Furthermore, changes in air quality, linked to increased wildfires and ground-level ozone formation, contribute to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease.  Food insecurity, resulting from shifts in agricultural yields and livestock production, can lead to malnutrition and micronutrient deficiencies.  Mental health consequences, including anxiety and stress related to climate-induced disasters and environmental degradation, are also increasingly recognized.  Addressing climate change is therefore crucial for mitigating these substantial and growing public health threats, necessitating integrated approaches combining climate mitigation and adaptation strategies with robust public health interventions.
