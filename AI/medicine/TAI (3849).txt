Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health, jeopardizing the effective treatment of bacterial infections and undermining crucial medical advancements.  This review examines the multifaceted dimensions of AR, encompassing its underlying mechanisms, contributing factors, and far-reaching global implications.  The widespread use and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, have driven the selection and propagation of resistant bacterial strains.  This phenomenon is exacerbated by the limited development of novel antibiotics, creating a critical imbalance between the emergence of resistance and the availability of effective therapeutic options.  The consequences extend beyond individual health outcomes, impacting healthcare systems, economic productivity, and global security.  This paper analyzes the complex interplay of factors driving AR, exploring the effectiveness of current control strategies, and examining potential future scenarios. We further discuss the need for a multi-pronged, globally coordinated approach encompassing stewardship programs, improved diagnostics, innovative research into alternative therapies, and strengthened public health infrastructure to mitigate the impending crisis of untreatable infections.
