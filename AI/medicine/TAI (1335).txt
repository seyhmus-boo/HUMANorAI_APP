Adolescent mental health disorders are experiencing a concerning upward trend, driven by complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors.  Increased rates of anxiety, depression, and substance abuse highlight the urgent need for interdisciplinary approaches to treatment.  Biological vulnerabilities, such as genetic predispositions and hormonal fluctuations, interact with psychological stressors like academic pressure and social isolation, exacerbated by societal factors like social media use and economic inequality.

Effective treatment requires collaboration between psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, and educators. Psychiatrists provide medication management, while psychologists offer therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT). Social workers address socio-environmental challenges impacting mental well-being, fostering family support and navigating access to resources. Educators play a crucial role in early identification, creating supportive school environments, and providing psychoeducation.  This integrated model, emphasizing holistic care and addressing multiple contributing factors simultaneously, is crucial for improving outcomes and preventing long-term consequences of untreated adolescent mental health disorders.
