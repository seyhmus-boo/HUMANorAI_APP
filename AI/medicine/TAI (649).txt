Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), a paradigm shift in surgical practice, has undergone remarkable evolution since its inception.  Early attempts, dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, involved limited incisions for specific procedures like cholecystectomy.  However, the true revolution began with the advent of laparoscopy in the mid-20th century, initially hampered by technical limitations in instrumentation and visualization.  This presentation will trace the key advancements driving this evolution, focusing on the transition from rudimentary laparoscopic techniques to the sophisticated robotic-assisted and single-port approaches of today.  We will analyze the impact of technological improvements, including enhanced imaging systems (e.g., high-definition cameras, 3D visualization), advanced energy sources (e.g., ultrasonic shears, bipolar coagulation), and refined instrumentation offering increased dexterity and precision.  Furthermore, we will discuss the concurrent development of surgical simulation and training methodologies that have been crucial in improving surgeon proficiency and patient safety. Finally, the presentation will briefly consider future directions, including artificial intelligence integration and the potential of entirely novel MIS techniques, underscoring the ongoing dynamism of this rapidly evolving surgical field.
