The emergence and proliferation of antibiotic resistance represents a grave global health security threat.  Historically, the discovery of penicillin in the 1920s ushered in the "antibiotic era," effectively controlling previously lethal bacterial infections.  However, the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics since then has driven the selection and evolution of resistant strains. This is a predictable consequence of evolutionary pressure; bacteria with naturally occurring resistance mechanisms survive and proliferate, transferring these traits horizontally via plasmids.

The global implications are profound.  Treatment of common infections becomes increasingly challenging, leading to prolonged illness, higher mortality rates, and increased healthcare costs.  The effectiveness of surgical procedures, organ transplantation, and cancer chemotherapy – all reliant on antibiotic prophylaxis – is compromised.  Furthermore, the economic burden extends beyond healthcare, impacting agricultural productivity (livestock farming) and potentially hindering global development efforts.  Addressing this crisis demands a multi-pronged approach, encompassing responsible antibiotic stewardship, improved sanitation, and accelerated development of novel antimicrobials.
