This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and the established link between climate change and public health.  While seemingly disparate fields, a quantum mechanical lens offers unique insights into several key areas.  Firstly, we examine the role of quantum phenomena in atmospheric chemistry, specifically focusing on the quantum behavior of molecules involved in greenhouse gas formation and their radiative properties.  Understanding these processes at a fundamental level can refine climate models and improve predictions of future health impacts.  Secondly, we discuss the potential of quantum computing to accelerate the development of novel therapeutics and diagnostics for climate-change-related illnesses, such as vector-borne diseases and respiratory illnesses exacerbated by air pollution.  Quantum simulations can enhance drug discovery and personalized medicine approaches, addressing the health disparities disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations impacted by climate change.  Finally, we consider the ethical implications of employing quantum technologies in this context, emphasizing the importance of equitable access and responsible innovation to ensure the benefits are globally distributed.  This presentation advocates for interdisciplinary research bridging quantum science, climate modeling, and public health to address this pressing global challenge.
