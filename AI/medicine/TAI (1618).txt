Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health, jeopardizing the effective treatment of bacterial infections and undermining progress in modern medicine.  While the clinical consequences are widely acknowledged, translating this understanding into effective interventions remains a considerable challenge, significantly hampered by experimental limitations. This paper focuses on the multifaceted experimental hurdles hindering progress in AR research.  Specifically, we examine the difficulties in accurately simulating the complex in vivo environment of bacterial infections, including the interplay between bacterial populations, host immune responses, and the microbiome.  Furthermore, the development of robust and standardized experimental models that can accurately reflect the diversity of bacterial species and resistance mechanisms remains a critical area of unmet need.  The challenges of predicting and evaluating the effectiveness of novel therapeutic strategies, both individually and in combination, are also discussed.  Addressing these experimental challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach incorporating advancements in microbiology, immunology, bioinformatics, and advanced imaging technologies to provide more robust and predictive data, thereby informing the development and implementation of effective strategies to combat the global threat of antibiotic resistance.
