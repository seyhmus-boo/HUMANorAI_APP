Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating threat to global health security.  The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture has driven the selection and proliferation of resistant bacterial strains. This phenomenon renders previously effective treatments ineffective, leading to prolonged illness, increased mortality, and higher healthcare costs.  The global implications are profound, encompassing increased morbidity and mortality from infections previously considered easily treatable, particularly in vulnerable populations.  The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA), necessitates urgent action.  AR not only impacts healthcare systems, straining resources and capabilities, but also undermines socioeconomic development by hindering productivity and increasing healthcare expenditures.  Furthermore, the lack of new antibiotic development pipelines exacerbates the crisis, highlighting the critical need for collaborative, multi-sectoral approaches encompassing surveillance, stewardship programs, research into novel therapeutic strategies, and the implementation of preventative measures to mitigate this globally pervasive challenge.
