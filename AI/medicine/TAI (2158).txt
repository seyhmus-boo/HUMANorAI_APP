Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  Central concerns revolve around the allocation of scarce organs, often necessitating prioritization frameworks that grapple with competing values such as need, utility, and justice.  Recent developments in predictive modeling and machine learning aim to improve allocation algorithms, striving for fairer distribution, but raise concerns about potential algorithmic bias and transparency.

Another key ethical tension lies in informed consent and the definition of death, particularly with the increasing use of donation after circulatory death (DCD).  Ensuring genuinely voluntary consent from donors and their families remains paramount, demanding careful consideration of emotional distress and potential coercion.  Furthermore, the expanding field of xenotransplantation, utilizing animal organs, necessitates rigorous ethical scrutiny regarding animal welfare, the risk of zoonotic disease transmission, and equitable access to potentially costly procedures.  These advancements highlight the ongoing need for robust ethical frameworks, public discourse, and interdisciplinary collaboration to navigate the complex moral landscape of organ transplantation.
