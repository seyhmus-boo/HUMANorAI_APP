The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Historically, cancer treatment was largely based on tumor location and stage, lacking individual patient consideration.  However, the discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in the late 20th century fundamentally shifted this paradigm.  Researchers identified specific mutations driving uncontrolled cell proliferation and apoptosis evasion, varying significantly between individuals.

Advances in genomic sequencing technologies, including next-generation sequencing (NGS), have enabled comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, revealing unique mutational landscapes.  This allows for the identification of targetable mutations, informing the selection of therapies tailored to an individual's specific genetic profile.  For instance, identifying EGFR mutations in lung cancer allows for the targeted use of EGFR inhibitors.  Furthermore, understanding the genomic landscape facilitates the prediction of treatment response and resistance, allowing for proactive adjustments to therapeutic strategies.  While challenges remain regarding cost and accessibility, the integration of genomic data into clinical practice represents a crucial advance in cancer care, moving towards truly personalized and potentially curative interventions.
