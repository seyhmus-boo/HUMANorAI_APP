Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field. This lecture explores key challenges, focusing on three primary areas. Firstly, the allocation of scarce organs necessitates a just and equitable system, moving beyond simple 'first-come, first-served' models.  Debate continues regarding the relative merits of criteria emphasizing medical urgency, predicted life expectancy post-transplant, or societal contribution. Secondly, the issue of informed consent is paramount, demanding meticulous pre-transplant counselling addressing risks, benefits, and potential complications.  Vulnerable populations, facing coercion or undue influence, require specific protections. Thirdly, the burgeoning field of living organ donation raises ethical dilemmas regarding potential donor exploitation and the balance between altruism and self-interest.  Ensuring donor autonomy and minimizing potential harm are critical.  This lecture concludes by highlighting the ongoing need for robust ethical frameworks and continuous critical appraisal of existing policies to ensure the ethical integrity of organ transplantation practices.
