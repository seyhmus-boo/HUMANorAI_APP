This presentation examines the evolving landscape of mental health disorders in adolescents, tracing historical trends and exploring contemporary treatment approaches.  Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with limited understanding and inadequate resources.  Early conceptualizations lacked the nuance of modern diagnostic frameworks, leading to misdiagnosis and insufficient intervention.  However, increased awareness, fueled by epidemiological research, has highlighted the significant prevalence of conditions like anxiety, depression, and substance abuse disorders among this vulnerable population.  This presentation will analyze recent trends revealing shifts in presentation, diagnosis rates, and the impact of societal factors such as social media and academic pressure.  Furthermore, it will delve into the efficacy of various treatment modalities, including evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), alongside the role of psychopharmacology.  The presentation will conclude by emphasizing the critical need for early intervention, integrated care models, and accessible mental health services tailored to the unique developmental needs of adolescents to effectively address this growing public health concern.
