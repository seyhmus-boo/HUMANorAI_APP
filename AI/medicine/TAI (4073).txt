Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of MIS, highlighting key technological advancements that have driven this transformation.  From the initial laparoscopic approaches, characterized by limited dexterity and visualization, the field has witnessed significant progress.  The introduction of robotic surgery, with its enhanced precision and articulation, marked a crucial turning point, expanding the range of complex procedures amenable to MIS.  Concurrent developments in imaging technologies, such as 3D laparoscopy and fluorescence imaging, have further improved surgical accuracy and real-time tissue assessment.  Furthermore, the rise of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-port access techniques exemplifies the ongoing pursuit of even less invasive approaches.  Practical applications discussed will include examples from diverse surgical specialties, such as colorectal, gynecological, and urological surgery, illustrating the improved patient outcomes and reduced healthcare burden achieved through these evolving techniques.  The presentation will conclude by considering future directions, including the potential of artificial intelligence and augmented reality in further refining MIS methodologies.
