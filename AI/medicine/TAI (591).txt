Organ transplantation offers life-saving benefits but presents complex ethical dilemmas.  This abstract examines key ethical considerations in the field, focusing on three primary areas: donor consent, equitable allocation, and the potential for coercion and exploitation.  Informed consent from deceased donors, often obtained from surrogates, necessitates careful consideration of family grief and potential biases influencing decision-making.  Allocation systems strive for fairness and justice, balancing urgency of need against factors like organ quality and predicted post-transplant survival, yet inequalities persist based on socioeconomic status and geographic location.  Furthermore, concerns arise regarding the vulnerability of living donors, particularly in scenarios involving familial pressure or financial incentives, demanding robust safeguards against exploitation.  The development of ethically sound policies requires interdisciplinary collaboration, encompassing bioethics, law, and healthcare professionals, to navigate these challenges and ensure equitable access to life-saving therapies while protecting the rights and well-being of both donors and recipients.  Future research should focus on improving consent processes, developing more just allocation algorithms, and strengthening regulations to prevent coercion and promote transparency.
