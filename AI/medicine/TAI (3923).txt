Cancer, a complex group of diseases, has long challenged medical understanding.  Early research focused on identifying broad carcinogenic agents and developing generalized therapies, often with limited success due to inherent tumour heterogeneity.  However, the advent of high-throughput genomic technologies has revolutionized our understanding of cancer's genetic basis. This presentation will explore the significant advances made in elucidating the intricate interplay of mutations, epigenetic modifications, and gene expression patterns that drive oncogenesis.  We will trace the historical progression from identifying oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes to the current era of comprehensive genomic profiling.  This has led to the development of personalized medicine approaches, including targeted therapies based on specific genetic alterations identified within individual tumours.  Examples will be drawn from successes in treating specific cancers based on actionable mutations in genes such as EGFR, BRAF, and HER2.  Furthermore, we will discuss the challenges and future directions of this field, including the development of robust predictive biomarkers, the integration of multi-omics data, and the ethical considerations surrounding the widespread application of personalized cancer therapies.
