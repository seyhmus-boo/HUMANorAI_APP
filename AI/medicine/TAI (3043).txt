Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a formidable global health threat, undermining the efficacy of treatments for bacterial infections and jeopardizing progress in modern medicine.  While the clinical implications of AR are widely acknowledged, translating this understanding into effective mitigation strategies remains a significant challenge, largely hindered by limitations in experimental approaches. This paper addresses the critical experimental challenges encountered in AR research, focusing on the inherent complexities of studying bacterial evolution and the limitations of current *in vitro* and *in vivo* models.  The accurate modeling of bacterial population dynamics, including the diverse selective pressures influencing the acquisition and dissemination of resistance genes, remains problematic.  Furthermore, the complexities of the host-pathogen interaction, including the influence of the microbiome and immune response, are often inadequately represented in simplified experimental settings.  Finally, the difficulties in translating findings from laboratory-based experiments to clinical realities necessitate the development of novel experimental methodologies that better reflect the intricate dynamics of antibiotic resistance in diverse real-world scenarios. This review will critically evaluate these key experimental limitations and discuss potential avenues for future research to overcome these hurdles.
