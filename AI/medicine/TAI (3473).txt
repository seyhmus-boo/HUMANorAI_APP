Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, yet establishing robust causal relationships through experimental research remains challenging.  This presentation explores the inherent difficulties in designing and implementing experiments to definitively link specific climate change impacts to specific health outcomes.  We discuss the ethical limitations of manipulating climate variables, the complexities of isolating climate effects from confounding socio-economic factors, and the long latency periods between climate events and their health consequences. The difficulties of establishing appropriate control groups, particularly at the population level, are highlighted, alongside the inherent challenges of measuring complex health outcomes impacted by climate change, such as mental health issues arising from extreme weather events.  Further, we will examine the feasibility of utilizing quasi-experimental designs and natural experiments, discussing their strengths and limitations in addressing these challenges.  Finally, the presentation will advocate for a multi-method approach, integrating experimental findings with observational data and modelling techniques, to build a more comprehensive understanding of the climate change-public health nexus.
