Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution, driven by interdisciplinary collaborations across engineering, materials science, and medicine.  Early laparoscopic techniques, hampered by limited visualization and dexterity, have been significantly advanced through technological innovations.  Robotic surgery, incorporating advanced imaging modalities like 3D visualization and enhanced articulation, has expanded the applicability of MIS to complex procedures previously confined to open surgery.  Concurrently, advancements in materials science, including the development of biocompatible polymers and improved suture materials, have facilitated smaller incisions and reduced post-operative complications.  The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into surgical planning and execution, through image analysis and predictive modelling, holds further promise for enhancing precision and minimizing invasiveness.  However, challenges remain, including the steep learning curve associated with advanced robotic systems, the need for specialized training across disciplines, and the ongoing evaluation of long-term outcomes. Future progress hinges on continued interdisciplinary collaboration to address these challenges and integrate emerging technologies, such as augmented reality and haptic feedback, into the evolving landscape of MIS.
