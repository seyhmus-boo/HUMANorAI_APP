Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the escalating crisis of antibiotic resistance, a phenomenon with profound global implications demanding an interdisciplinary response.  The overuse and misuse of antibiotics, driven by both clinical practice and agricultural applications, have propelled the selection and proliferation of resistant bacterial strains. This poses a significant threat to human health, potentially rendering common infections untreatable and increasing mortality rates.

The challenge transcends medical boundaries.  Economists must model the cost-effectiveness of antibiotic stewardship programs.  Social scientists are crucial in understanding behavioural changes needed to curtail antibiotic misuse.  Environmental scientists play a pivotal role in monitoring antibiotic residues in soil and water, elucidating pathways of resistance gene transfer.  Finally, advancements in synthetic biology and bioinformatics are essential for developing novel antimicrobial therapies and diagnostic tools.  Addressing this global health security issue requires a collaborative effort, integrating expertise from diverse fields to combat the rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria effectively.
