Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of bacteria to withstand antimicrobial drugs, poses a significant and escalating global health threat.  Driven by factors including overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, as well as inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, AR undermines the efficacy of life-saving treatments for infectious diseases.  The resulting increased morbidity and mortality rates are particularly impactful in low- and middle-income countries with limited healthcare resources.  Globally, AR contributes to substantial economic burdens through extended hospital stays, increased healthcare costs, and reduced productivity.

Practical applications to combat AR focus on multiple interconnected strategies.  These include developing novel antimicrobial agents through innovative drug discovery and repurposing existing drugs; optimizing existing antibiotic stewardship programs to minimize inappropriate prescription and improve patient adherence;  investing in improved sanitation and hygiene infrastructure to prevent the spread of resistant bacteria; and accelerating the development and implementation of rapid diagnostic tests to facilitate targeted treatment and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use.  Furthermore, promoting responsible antibiotic use in agriculture and aquaculture is crucial to mitigating the contribution of these sectors to the spread of resistance.  Addressing this complex challenge necessitates a multifaceted, global collaborative effort incorporating diverse scientific disciplines and public health initiatives.
