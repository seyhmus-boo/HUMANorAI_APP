Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have undergone a dramatic evolution since their inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and materials science.  Early MIS relied primarily on laparoscopy, utilizing rigid endoscopes and limited instrumentation, resulting in restricted dexterity and visualization.  Technological progress introduced flexible endoscopes, offering improved maneuverability and access to complex anatomical regions.  Concurrent developments in robotic surgery, such as the da Vinci system, significantly enhanced precision, control, and surgeon ergonomics through articulated instruments and 3D visualization.  This has expanded the applicability of MIS to procedures previously considered only amenable to open surgery.

Further evolution includes natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), striving for scarless surgery via natural orifices. Though still in development, NOTES holds significant promise, minimizing trauma and accelerating recovery.  Advances in energy sources, including ultrasonic shears and bipolar coagulation, improve hemostasis and tissue dissection, reducing complications.  The integration of augmented reality and artificial intelligence offers potential for improved surgical planning, real-time guidance, and personalized procedures.  Practical applications span diverse surgical specialties, encompassing cholecystectomies, colorectal resections, cardiac interventions, and even neurosurgery, consistently demonstrating reduced hospital stays, faster recovery times, and improved patient outcomes compared to traditional open approaches.  However, challenges remain in terms of training, cost, and access, hindering widespread adoption.
