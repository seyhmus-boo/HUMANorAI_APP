Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, deeply rooted in historical controversies. Early practices, often lacking robust consent protocols, highlighted the inherent vulnerability of potential donors.  The evolution from cadaveric donation, initially reliant on often questionable consent obtained from grieving families, to the more regulated living donation model, underscores the ongoing struggle for ethical frameworks.  

Central ethical dilemmas revolve around the allocation of scarce resources, prompting debates about distributive justice and the criteria for prioritizing recipients.  Concerns persist regarding the potential for coercion of vulnerable donors, particularly in developing nations, and the fair compensation of living donors, navigating the fine line between altruism and financial incentive.  Furthermore, the definition of death itself has been contested, raising crucial questions about brain death criteria and the potential for organ procurement to influence medical decisions.  Addressing these ethical challenges requires ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue, encompassing bioethics, law, and healthcare policy, to ensure equitable and just practices in organ transplantation.
