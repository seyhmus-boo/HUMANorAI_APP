Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant global public health concern, exhibiting concerning upward trends in recent years.  This abstract reviews current epidemiological data highlighting increasing prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors among this vulnerable population.  Contributing factors, including societal pressures, technological advancements, and biological vulnerabilities, warrant further investigation to inform preventative strategies.  Treatment approaches, traditionally reliant on psychotherapy (CBT, DBT) and pharmacotherapy (SSRIs, antipsychotics), are evolving to incorporate integrated care models emphasizing early intervention and a holistic approach.  The efficacy of these treatments varies depending on the specific disorder and individual factors, highlighting the need for personalized treatment plans. Emerging digital health technologies offer promising avenues for expanding access to care, particularly for underserved populations, through telehealth platforms and mobile applications.  However, challenges remain in addressing disparities in access to quality mental healthcare, and further research is crucial to optimize treatment strategies and improve long-term outcomes for adolescents struggling with mental health challenges.  Future research should focus on longitudinal studies investigating the impact of emerging risk and protective factors, alongside rigorous evaluations of innovative treatment approaches.
