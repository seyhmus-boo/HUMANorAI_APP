Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are multifaceted and complex, stemming from the inherent scarcity of viable organs and the profound implications for both donors and recipients.  Central dilemmas revolve around the definition of death, particularly the shift towards donation after circulatory death (DCD), raising concerns about the precise moment of irreversible cessation.  Furthermore, the allocation of organs necessitates navigating justice and fairness, prompting debates surrounding criteria prioritization (e.g., medical urgency versus waiting time).  Concerns arise over potential biases in allocation systems, disproportionately impacting marginalized groups.

The equitable distribution of resources is further complicated by issues of informed consent, particularly in cases involving deceased or incapacitated donors where surrogate decision-making presents challenges.  Commercialization of organs remains a significant ethical violation, exacerbating inequalities and potentially compromising patient safety.  Finally, the psychological and emotional impact on both donor families and recipients demands careful consideration, requiring robust support systems and ethical guidelines to mitigate potential distress.  Practical applications necessitate transparent and rigorously monitored allocation systems, coupled with robust education and public awareness campaigns promoting organ donation and addressing associated ethical complexities.  Ethical review boards play a crucial role in overseeing transplantation practices and ensuring adherence to established principles.
