Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and development of mental health disorders.  Historically, adolescent mental health has been significantly under-researched and often overlooked, with societal attitudes often minimizing or misattributing the distress experienced by young people.  Early conceptualizations focused primarily on overt behavioral problems, neglecting the complex interplay of internalizing disorders such as anxiety and depression.  However, recent decades have witnessed a growing awareness of the prevalence and debilitating impact of a broad spectrum of mental health conditions in this demographic, including but not limited to depression, anxiety disorders, eating disorders, and substance abuse.  This shift in understanding has driven a surge in research investigating prevalence trends, risk factors, and effective interventions. This paper will examine the evolving landscape of adolescent mental health, analyzing emerging trends in the prevalence and presentation of various disorders while critically evaluating the efficacy and accessibility of contemporary treatments. We will consider both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic approaches, acknowledging the limitations and exploring avenues for future research aimed at improving early detection, prevention, and personalized care for adolescents struggling with mental illness.
