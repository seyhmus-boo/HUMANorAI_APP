Antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria to withstand the effects of antibiotics, poses a significant global threat, akin to a rapidly evolving arms race.  Initially, antibiotics were powerful weapons, effectively eliminating bacterial infections. However, bacteria, like resourceful adversaries, have developed mechanisms to circumvent these attacks.  This is analogous to a fortress upgrading its defenses in response to increasingly sophisticated siege weaponry.  Genetic mutations, horizontal gene transfer (bacteria sharing resistance genes like exchanging blueprints), and selective pressure (antibiotic overuse favoring resistant strains) all contribute to the spread of resistance, much like the spread of innovative warfare strategies amongst competing armies.

The global implications are far-reaching.  The effectiveness of modern medicine, particularly surgery and organ transplantation, relies heavily on antibiotics to prevent infections; their failure would cripple these procedures.  Furthermore, the economic burden of treating resistant infections, requiring longer hospital stays and more expensive treatments, is substantial, comparable to the economic devastation caused by prolonged warfare. Ultimately, a world without effective antibiotics would revert to a pre-antibiotic era where even minor infections could become life-threatening, a stark return to a more primitive and precarious healthcare landscape.
