Historically, understanding the link between nutrition and chronic disease was rudimentary, with infectious diseases dominating mortality statistics.  However, the 20th century witnessed a shift, as cardiovascular disease and certain cancers emerged as leading causes of death, alongside a parallel rise in processed food consumption and sedentary lifestyles.  This spurred research into the role of diet in chronic disease aetiology.

Current understanding emphasizes the intricate interplay between macronutrients, micronutrients, and bioactive compounds in influencing chronic disease risk.  Dietary patterns high in saturated and trans fats, refined carbohydrates, and sodium are strongly associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers. Conversely, diets rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and omega-3 fatty acids are linked to reduced risk.  These effects are mediated through multiple pathways, including inflammation, oxidative stress, insulin resistance, and gut microbiome modulation.  Specific nutrient deficiencies, such as inadequate folate intake, can also increase the risk of certain cancers and neural tube defects.  Thus, optimizing nutrition plays a crucial preventative role in mitigating the burden of chronic diseases.
