This presentation explores the emerging field of applying quantum-inspired computational models to understand and treat mental health disorders in adolescents.  While classical approaches struggle with the complex, interconnected nature of adolescent brain development and its susceptibility to disorders like depression and anxiety, quantum mechanics offers a potential paradigm shift.  We will discuss recent trends in adolescent mental health, highlighting the increasing prevalence and earlier onset of these conditions, often exacerbated by societal factors and technological influences.  The presentation will then focus on how quantum computing's ability to handle high-dimensional data and explore non-linear relationships might improve diagnostic accuracy and treatment efficacy.  Specifically, we'll examine the potential of quantum machine learning algorithms for personalized prediction models, identifying at-risk individuals and tailoring interventions.  Furthermore, we will explore the application of quantum-inspired optimization techniques to design more efficient and effective therapeutic strategies, potentially including novel drug discovery and personalized psychotherapy approaches.  The limitations of current quantum approaches and future research directions will also be discussed, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between mental health professionals, computer scientists, and physicists to realize the transformative potential of this emerging field.
