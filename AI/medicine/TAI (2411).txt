Adolescent mental health disorders have historically been under-recognized, with earlier conceptualizations often conflating them with typical developmental challenges.  However, recent decades have witnessed a surge in both prevalence and awareness.  Trends indicate increasing rates of anxiety disorders, depression, and self-harm behaviours, potentially influenced by societal factors like increased academic pressure, social media usage, and economic instability.  While biological vulnerabilities play a role, the interplay of genetic predisposition and environmental stressors is increasingly acknowledged.

Treatment approaches have evolved significantly from predominantly psychodynamic methods to encompass a wider array of evidence-based interventions.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are prominent examples, effectively targeting maladaptive thoughts and behaviours.  Pharmacological interventions, including antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, are also utilized, often in conjunction with psychotherapy, although careful consideration of potential side effects and long-term implications is paramount.  Early intervention is crucial, with a growing emphasis on preventative strategies aimed at fostering resilience and promoting mental well-being in schools and communities.  Further research is needed to refine existing treatments and develop culturally sensitive interventions that address the unique challenges faced by diverse adolescent populations.
