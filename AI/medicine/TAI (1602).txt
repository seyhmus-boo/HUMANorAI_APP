Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding innovative solutions beyond traditional approaches. This presentation explores the potential of quantum mechanics to address this crisis, focusing on two key areas. Firstly, we examine the application of quantum computing to accelerate drug discovery.  Classical methods struggle with the vast chemical space to explore when designing novel antibiotics. Quantum algorithms, particularly those leveraging quantum annealing and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approaches, offer the prospect of significantly reducing the computational cost associated with identifying and optimizing antibiotic candidates with enhanced efficacy and reduced likelihood of resistance development. Secondly, we discuss the use of quantum simulations to elucidate the complex interactions between antibiotics and their target bacterial proteins at the atomic level.  Such simulations can provide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms of resistance, revealing subtle structural changes responsible for drug inefficacy.  This detailed mechanistic understanding can inform the rational design of novel antibiotics and resistance-breaking strategies. By showcasing the potential of quantum technologies to revolutionize antibiotic development and our understanding of AR, we argue for increased investment and interdisciplinary collaboration in this burgeoning field.  The global implications of successfully tackling AR using quantum mechanics are far-reaching, promising a future with effective treatment of bacterial infections.
