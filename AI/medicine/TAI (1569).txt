The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a significant global challenge.  Historically, environmental health concerns have linked weather patterns to disease outbreaks, with cholera epidemics, for example, demonstrably linked to water contamination exacerbated by rainfall variability. However, anthropogenic climate change intensifies these pre-existing vulnerabilities.  Rising temperatures contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Altered precipitation patterns affect waterborne and vector-borne disease prevalence, expanding the geographical range of pathogens like malaria and dengue fever.  Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, disrupt healthcare infrastructure and displace populations, leading to immediate health consequences and long-term mental health issues.  Furthermore,  changes in air quality, driven by both direct emissions and indirect effects like wildfires, exacerbate respiratory illnesses.  In essence, climate change acts as a threat multiplier, exacerbating existing health inequalities and generating novel public health challenges that demand proactive, multi-sectoral mitigation and adaptation strategies.
