Organ transplantation represents a remarkable triumph of modern medicine, offering a lifeline to individuals facing end-stage organ failure. However, this life-saving procedure is fraught with complex ethical dilemmas that demand careful consideration.  The scarcity of transplantable organs necessitates the development and implementation of robust allocation systems, prompting questions of fairness, justice, and the potential for discrimination against certain populations.  Furthermore, the process raises concerns regarding informed consent, particularly in cases of living donation where the potential for coercion or undue influence must be carefully mitigated.  The definition of death itself remains a point of contention, with ongoing debate surrounding the criteria for determining brain death and its implications for organ procurement.  This paper examines these critical ethical considerations within the context of organ transplantation, exploring the practical applications of ethical frameworks in various stages of the process, from donor identification and consent to recipient selection and post-transplant care.  We analyze existing policies and propose potential solutions to address the inherent challenges and ensure equitable and ethical access to life-saving organ transplantation.
