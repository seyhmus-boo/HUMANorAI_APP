Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents complex ethical dilemmas.  Central to these is the allocation of scarce organs, necessitating equitable distribution systems.  Prioritising patients based solely on medical urgency neglects factors like age, lifestyle, and societal contribution, potentially leading to discriminatory outcomes.  The development of objective, transparent criteria, incorporating both medical need and societal benefit, remains a significant challenge.  Further ethical concerns arise around informed consent, particularly in cases of living donors, ensuring their decision is truly voluntary and free from coercion.  The potential for exploitation, particularly in developing countries, demands robust regulatory frameworks and international collaboration to prevent organ trafficking and commodification.  Practical application involves rigorous ethical review boards, transparent allocation algorithms, and stringent regulations governing donor consent and organ procurement, aiming to balance the imperative to save lives with fundamental principles of justice and fairness.
