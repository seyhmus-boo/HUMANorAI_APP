Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and multifaceted challenge.  This review summarizes key ethical dilemmas arising at various stages of the process, from organ procurement to allocation and post-transplant care.  Informed consent, a cornerstone of medical ethics, faces particular scrutiny in the context of deceased donation, requiring careful consideration of family wishes and potential conflicts of interest.  The just allocation of scarce organs necessitates transparent and equitable systems, balancing medical urgency with factors such as waiting time and organ compatibility.  Furthermore, the potential for coercion, exploitation, and commodification, especially in the context of living donation, demands rigorous oversight and robust regulatory frameworks.  The review highlights the ongoing debate surrounding the definition of death, particularly brain death, and its implications for organ procurement.  Finally, the long-term implications of transplantation, including immunosuppression-related complications and potential psychological burdens, necessitate comprehensive patient support and ongoing ethical evaluation of practices.  Further research is needed to address these persistent ethical challenges and ensure the continued integrity and fairness of organ transplantation systems globally.
