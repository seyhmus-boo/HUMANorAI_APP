Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, driven by technological advancements and a growing emphasis on patient-centered care.  Early MIS techniques, predominantly laparoscopy, relied on rigid instrumentation and limited dexterity, resulting in a steep learning curve and certain procedural limitations.  The introduction of smaller diameter instruments, improved optics (e.g., high-definition cameras and 3D visualization), and robotic-assisted platforms significantly enhanced precision and surgeon control.  Robotic surgery, in particular, offered enhanced dexterity, tremor filtration, and magnified 3D visualization, expanding the scope of MIS to complex procedures previously confined to open surgery.  Further refinements, such as single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), minimized invasiveness even further, aiming for scarless surgery and reducing post-operative complications.  Ongoing research focuses on augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and advanced imaging modalities to further improve the precision, safety, and efficacy of MIS, promising continued evolution in this transformative field.
