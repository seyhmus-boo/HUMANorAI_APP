Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized healthcare, yet their evolution from open surgery remains largely analyzed through a classical lens. This abstract proposes a quantum mechanical perspective, focusing on the information-theoretic aspects of surgical precision and control.  The transition from macroscopic incisions to smaller, more targeted interventions can be viewed as a reduction in the system's overall uncertainty, analogous to wave-function collapse.  Advances like robotic surgery introduce a degree of entanglement between surgeon and instrument, allowing for enhanced dexterity and precision beyond classical limitations.  The inherent uncertainties in tissue manipulation and instrument control can be modelled using quantum probability distributions, offering a quantitative framework for assessing surgical success. Furthermore, the use of advanced imaging modalities, such as those employing quantum phenomena, enhances information acquisition, decreasing the system's uncertainty and improving surgical accuracy.  Future research should explore the application of quantum error correction principles to mitigate errors and improve the robustness of MIS procedures.  A deeper understanding of MIS from this framework could lead to innovative approaches in surgical instrument design, training methodologies, and ultimately, improved patient outcomes.
