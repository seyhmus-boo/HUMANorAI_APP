Cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease, arising from somatic mutations accumulating within cells.  Recent advancements in genomic technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of various cancers, paving the way for personalized medicine.  This presentation will explore the key genetic alterations driving oncogenesis, focusing on driver mutations, fusion genes, and epigenetic modifications across different cancer types. We will highlight the impact of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and other high-throughput technologies in identifying these alterations, allowing for more precise cancer classification and prognosis.  Furthermore, we will discuss the practical applications of this knowledge in tailoring cancer therapies.  This includes the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, which specifically target mutated proteins involved in cancer development.  The integration of genomic data into clinical decision-making allows for the selection of optimal treatment strategies, minimizing adverse effects and maximizing treatment efficacy.  Ultimately, we will argue that a deeper understanding of the genetic basis of cancer is crucial for improving patient outcomes through the ongoing development and implementation of personalized medicine approaches.
