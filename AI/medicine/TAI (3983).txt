Organ transplantation offers a life-saving intervention for individuals with end-stage organ failure; however, its implementation is fraught with complex ethical dilemmas. This paper examines the multifaceted ethical considerations surrounding organ transplantation, focusing on three key areas:  donor consent and autonomy, equitable allocation of scarce resources, and the potential for exploitation and coercion.  The increasing global demand for organs necessitates a rigorous exploration of informed consent procedures, encompassing both deceased and living donation, and addressing issues of capacity and vulnerability amongst potential donors.  Furthermore, we analyze the ethical frameworks guiding organ allocation, critically assessing existing systems based on medical urgency, waiting list time, and other criteria,  and highlighting disparities in access based on socioeconomic factors and geographic location. Finally, we discuss the ethical implications of commercialization and the potential for organ trafficking, emphasizing the need for robust regulatory frameworks to protect vulnerable populations and prevent the exploitation of those in desperate need of transplantation. This analysis aims to contribute to ongoing dialogue regarding the ethical optimization of organ transplantation practices, promoting equitable access and upholding the dignity of both donors and recipients.
