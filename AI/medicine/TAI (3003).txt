Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), prioritizing smaller incisions and reduced trauma, has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception.  Early pioneers, notably during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, explored endoscopic techniques primarily for diagnostic purposes.  However, the true revolution began in the latter half of the 20th century with the advent of laparoscopy, initially limited to simple procedures.  Technological advancements, including improved imaging (e.g., high-definition cameras, 3D imaging), instrumentation (e.g., smaller, more flexible instruments, robotic arms), and energy sources (e.g., lasers, ultrasonic shears), significantly expanded the scope of MIS.

The development of robotic surgery, specifically the da Vinci Surgical System, marked a significant milestone, allowing for enhanced dexterity, precision, and tremor filtration.  This spurred the transition from conventional laparoscopy to robotic-assisted procedures, particularly in complex surgeries like cardiac and urological interventions.  Concurrent advancements in suture techniques, minimally invasive staplers, and tissue adhesives further optimized surgical outcomes. Ongoing research focuses on further miniaturization, augmented reality integration, and artificial intelligence applications to enhance precision, reduce invasiveness, and personalize surgical approaches, continually pushing the boundaries of MIS.
