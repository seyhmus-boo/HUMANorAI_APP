Climate change poses a significant and escalating threat to public health globally.  Recent research underscores the multifaceted nature of this relationship, extending beyond previously recognized impacts.  Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, directly cause injury and mortality through heat waves, floods, wildfires, and storms, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.  Indirect effects are equally concerning.  Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns alter disease vector distributions, leading to increased incidence of vector-borne illnesses like malaria, dengue fever, and Lyme disease.  Furthermore, climate change exacerbates air pollution, contributing to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  Food insecurity, resulting from altered agricultural yields, contributes to malnutrition and associated health problems.  Mental health impacts, stemming from displacement, loss of livelihoods, and exposure to traumatic events, are also increasingly recognized.  Recent modelling studies project substantial increases in climate-related morbidity and mortality in the coming decades unless significant mitigation and adaptation strategies are implemented.  These strategies require interdisciplinary collaborations encompassing climate science, public health, and social sciences to effectively address this complex and urgent challenge.
