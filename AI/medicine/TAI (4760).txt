Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant and growing public health concern, with prevalence rates increasing across many developed nations. Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, with societal perceptions often attributing behavioral difficulties to typical teenage rebellion rather than underlying pathology.  Early approaches focused primarily on institutionalization for severe cases, lacking the nuanced understanding of developmental psychopathology now prevalent.  However, increased research in the latter half of the 20th century, coupled with advocacy efforts, illuminated the complexity of adolescent mental health, revealing a wide spectrum of disorders including anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and substance abuse, often with significant comorbidity.  Current trends show a worrying rise in self-harm and suicide attempts, particularly among girls.  Treatment strategies are increasingly diverse and evidence-based, encompassing pharmacological interventions tailored to the developmental stage, alongside psychotherapeutic approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and family-based therapies.  Early intervention and integrated care models, emphasizing collaboration between mental health professionals, educators, and families, are becoming increasingly recognized as crucial for effective management and improved long-term outcomes.
