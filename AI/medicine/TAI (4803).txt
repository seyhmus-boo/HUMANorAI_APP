Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, is revolutionizing modern healthcare delivery.  Its increasing prevalence is driven by technological advancements such as high-speed internet, sophisticated mobile applications, and improved remote monitoring devices.  These developments enable a wider range of services, from virtual consultations and remote patient monitoring to telehealth-enabled surgery and rehabilitation.

Recent developments highlight its expanding role.  Artificial intelligence (AI) is being integrated to enhance diagnostic accuracy and personalize treatment plans via remote analysis of patient data.  The COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated telemedicine adoption, demonstrating its utility in mitigating the spread of infectious diseases while maintaining access to care.  However, challenges remain, including ensuring equitable access across socioeconomic strata, addressing data privacy and security concerns, and establishing clear regulatory frameworks for reimbursement and licensing.  Future research should focus on optimizing these aspects to fully realize telemedicine's potential for improving healthcare accessibility, affordability, and quality.
