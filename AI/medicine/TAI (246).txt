Cancer is a complex disease characterized by uncontrolled cellular proliferation and genomic instability, arising from intricate interplay between genetic predisposition and environmental factors.  Recent advancements in genomics and molecular biology have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of cancer, paving the way for the development of personalized medicine approaches. This review explores the rapidly evolving landscape of cancer genetics, focusing on how advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies, coupled with sophisticated bioinformatic analyses, are facilitating the identification of driver mutations, actionable genomic alterations, and predictive biomarkers. We discuss the implications of these discoveries for targeted therapies, including the development of novel therapeutic agents and the refinement of existing treatment strategies based on individual patient genetic profiles.  Furthermore, we examine the challenges and limitations of current personalized medicine approaches, such as the heterogeneity of cancer genomes, the complexities of tumor microenvironment interactions, and the accessibility and affordability of advanced genomic testing.  Finally, we consider future directions in cancer genetics research, focusing on the potential of integrating multi-omics data and artificial intelligence to further enhance the precision and effectiveness of personalized cancer care.
