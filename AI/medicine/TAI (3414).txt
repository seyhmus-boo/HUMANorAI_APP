Organ transplantation, a life-saving medical intervention, necessitates rigorous ethical scrutiny due to its inherent complexities. This abstract explores the crucial interdisciplinary ethical considerations surrounding organ allocation, procurement, and transplantation.  Justice and equity in allocation demand careful consideration of factors such as need, merit, and potential benefits, necessitating input from bioethicists, health economists, and social scientists to navigate competing claims and ensure fair access.  Organ procurement practices raise concerns regarding informed consent, particularly in cases of donation after cardiac death (DCD), demanding collaboration between clinicians, legal experts, and ethicists to define acceptable practices and safeguard donor autonomy.  Furthermore, post-transplant issues like immunosuppression and long-term care necessitate a multidisciplinary approach involving clinicians, psychologists, and social workers to address patient wellbeing and optimize treatment adherence.  Interdisciplinary collaboration is therefore pivotal to navigate the intricate ethical landscape of organ transplantation, achieving a balance between maximizing societal benefit and upholding individual rights and values.  Future research should focus on enhancing communication, establishing clearer guidelines, and developing robust frameworks for equitable and ethical organ allocation and procurement.
