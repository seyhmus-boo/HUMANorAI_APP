Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine and public health infrastructure. This presentation will examine the multifaceted nature of AR, exploring its complex interplay of ecological, societal, and evolutionary factors.  We will review the key mechanisms driving the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal health, as well as the influence of environmental contamination.  The consequences of unchecked AR are far-reaching, impacting healthcare systems through increased morbidity, mortality, and treatment costs.  Moreover, the potential for treatment failures in common infections threatens progress in numerous fields, including surgery, cancer therapy, and organ transplantation.  This presentation will highlight the urgent need for a multi-pronged approach to combat AR, encompassing improved antibiotic stewardship, the development of novel antimicrobial agents and therapies, and strengthened global surveillance and collaboration.  Finally, we will discuss the critical role of public health education and policy interventions in mitigating this global crisis and ensuring future access to effective antibiotics.
