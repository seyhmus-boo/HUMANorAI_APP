Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, significantly improving patient outcomes.  Early laparoscopic techniques, characterized by limited visualization and instrument dexterity, have been progressively refined.  Technological advancements, including high-definition cameras, smaller instruments with enhanced articulation, and robotic-assisted platforms, have enabled more complex procedures to be performed minimally invasively.  This review examines the key milestones in this evolution, highlighting the transition from rudimentary laparoscopy to sophisticated robotic surgery and single-port access.  Improved imaging modalities, such as 3D visualization and fluorescence imaging, have further enhanced precision and safety.  While challenges remain, such as the learning curve associated with new technologies and the potential for complications, ongoing research focuses on refining existing techniques, developing novel approaches like natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), and exploring the application of artificial intelligence for improved surgical planning and execution.  The future of MIS promises even greater precision, reduced invasiveness, and improved patient recovery times.
