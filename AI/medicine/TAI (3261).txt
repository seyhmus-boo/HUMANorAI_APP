Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  Rising temperatures contribute directly to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.  Furthermore, alterations in weather patterns, including more frequent and intense extreme weather events (e.g., floods, droughts, wildfires), lead to displacement, injuries, and the spread of infectious diseases. Changes in precipitation and temperature affect the geographical distribution and prevalence of vector-borne illnesses like malaria, dengue fever, and Lyme disease, expanding their reach into previously unaffected regions.  Indirect health impacts are equally substantial, encompassing malnutrition due to agricultural disruptions, mental health consequences stemming from displacement and trauma, and increased respiratory illnesses caused by worsening air quality.  The synergistic effects of these impacts exacerbate existing health inequalities, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities with limited access to healthcare resources and adaptive capacity.  Comprehensive mitigation and adaptation strategies are urgently needed to address the complex interplay between climate change and public health, prioritizing vulnerable populations and promoting climate-resilient healthcare systems.
