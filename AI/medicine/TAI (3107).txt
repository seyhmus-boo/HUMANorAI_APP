Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social change, is characterized by a heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders.  This paper examines current trends in the prevalence and presentation of common adolescent mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  We analyze data from recent epidemiological studies to identify shifts in diagnostic rates, symptom profiles, and help-seeking behaviors across diverse populations.  Furthermore, the paper reviews established and emerging treatment modalities for these disorders, focusing on evidence-based interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medication management, and family-based therapies.  A critical analysis of the efficacy, accessibility, and limitations of these treatments within diverse sociocultural contexts is undertaken.  Specifically, we address disparities in access to care and explore the impact of factors such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender on both prevalence rates and treatment outcomes. The study concludes by highlighting crucial areas for future research and advocating for improved preventative strategies and accessible, culturally-sensitive mental health services for adolescents.
