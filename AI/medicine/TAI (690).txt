Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This lecture explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human well-being.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns exacerbate waterborne diseases and vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever, through alterations in mosquito breeding habitats and pathogen transmission dynamics.  Extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, displace populations, damage infrastructure crucial for sanitation and healthcare access, and contribute to food insecurity and malnutrition, all factors with profound health consequences.  Furthermore, climate change-induced air pollution exacerbates respiratory illnesses.  These impacts disproportionately affect low-income communities and developing nations, widening existing health disparities.  Effective mitigation and adaptation strategies are crucial, integrating public health considerations into climate policy to safeguard global health security in the face of a changing climate.  Addressing climate change is therefore not merely an environmental imperative, but a fundamental public health priority.
