While classical genetics provides the foundational understanding of oncogenesis, a quantum mechanical perspective offers intriguing avenues for refining personalized cancer therapies.  At the molecular level, the intricacies of DNA replication and repair, crucial in cancer development, are governed by quantum tunneling phenomena.  Electron transfer processes within DNA, vital for cellular function and susceptibility to mutation, are inherently quantum mechanical.  Advances in understanding these quantum events are enabling the development of more precise diagnostic tools.  For example, quantum computing allows for the simulation of complex molecular interactions, facilitating the prediction of drug-target binding affinities with unprecedented accuracy. This enhances personalized medicine by identifying optimal therapies based on an individual's unique genetic makeup and predicted response to treatment.  Further, quantum sensing technologies hold promise in early cancer detection, leveraging the minute magnetic field fluctuations associated with cancerous cells.  While still nascent, this quantum-informed approach holds potential to revolutionize cancer diagnosis and treatment beyond classical genetic approaches.
