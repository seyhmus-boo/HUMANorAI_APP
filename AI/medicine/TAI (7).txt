Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIST) have revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This presentation traces the evolution of MIST, highlighting key technological advancements and their impact on surgical approaches.  We will explore the progression from early laparoscopic techniques, initially limited by instrumentation and visualization challenges, to the current era of robotic surgery and advanced imaging modalities.  The transition from 2D to 3D visualization, the development of smaller, more dexterous instruments, and the incorporation of enhanced energy sources will be discussed.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the ongoing shift towards single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), emphasizing the inherent challenges and future potential of these techniques.  We will conclude by examining current research directions, including augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and personalized surgical planning, and their potential to further refine MIST and broaden its application across various surgical specialties.  The overall aim is to provide a concise overview of the remarkable journey of MIST and its promising trajectory for the future of surgery.
