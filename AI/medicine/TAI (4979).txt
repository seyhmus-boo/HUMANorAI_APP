Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant and growing global health concern. Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with societal stigma and a lack of specialized services hindering effective intervention.  Early conceptualizations, primarily focused on psychodynamic perspectives, have evolved significantly, incorporating biological, psychological, and social factors within biopsychosocial models.  Recent epidemiological studies reveal escalating rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors, particularly amongst girls. These trends are likely influenced by multiple factors including increased academic pressures, social media usage, and societal changes.  Effective treatments have also evolved, moving beyond traditional approaches such as psychodynamic therapy to encompass evidence-based interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  However, access to appropriate care remains a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings.  Future research should focus on early identification strategies, culturally sensitive interventions, and optimizing the integration of technological advancements to improve access and address the unique challenges faced by this vulnerable population.  Addressing the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors is crucial for developing comprehensive and effective preventative and treatment strategies.
