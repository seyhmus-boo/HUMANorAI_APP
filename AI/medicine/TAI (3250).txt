Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents a significant challenge to developing truly personalized medicine. While genomic sequencing has revolutionized cancer understanding, translating this knowledge into effective, targeted therapies remains fraught with experimental hurdles.  This presentation will explore key challenges hindering the progress of personalized cancer treatment based on genetic profiling.  We will discuss the limitations of current sequencing technologies in detecting low-frequency mutations and complex genomic rearrangements crucial for treatment selection.  Furthermore, the difficulties in accurately predicting treatment response based solely on genomic data will be addressed, highlighting the interplay of genetic and non-genetic factors like the tumour microenvironment. We will examine the complexities of developing and validating preclinical models that accurately reflect the heterogeneity of individual patient cancers, and the inherent challenges in translating promising preclinical findings to clinical trials.  Finally, we will consider ethical and accessibility considerations related to the implementation of personalized cancer medicine, emphasizing the need for robust and equitable solutions.  The presentation will conclude by outlining promising avenues for future research, focusing on improved technological approaches and a more holistic understanding of tumour biology.
