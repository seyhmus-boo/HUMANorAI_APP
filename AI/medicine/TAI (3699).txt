This presentation examines the evolving landscape of mental health disorders in adolescents, tracing historical trends and analyzing contemporary treatment approaches.  Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, with societal stigma and limited diagnostic tools hindering accurate identification and effective intervention.  The 20th century saw gradual progress, marked by the emergence of diagnostic manuals like the DSM and increased awareness of conditions such as depression and anxiety. However, recent decades have witnessed a concerning rise in the prevalence of these disorders, alongside a surge in self-harm and suicidal ideation, particularly among girls.  This increase may be attributed to a complex interplay of factors including societal pressures, technological advancements, and potential biological vulnerabilities.  The presentation will explore contemporary treatment modalities, encompassing evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), alongside the role of medication and family-based interventions.  Finally, it will discuss ongoing challenges, including early detection, access to care, and the need for integrated, multidisciplinary approaches to address this critical public health issue and improve the mental well-being of adolescents.
