While a direct quantum mechanical explanation of the relationship between climate change and public health is currently beyond the scope of established theory, we can consider an indirect approach. Climate change, driven by macroscopic alterations in atmospheric composition, induces shifts in numerous environmental parameters.  These changes, from increased temperatures and extreme weather events to altered vector distributions, affect human health through complex, non-linear pathways.  

A quantum mechanical perspective might focus on the intricate interactions at a molecular level.  For example, altered atmospheric composition can influence the electronic structure and vibrational modes of molecules relevant to air quality, potentially enhancing their toxicity or reactivity. This altered reactivity impacts biochemical pathways in the human body, triggering cascading effects at a macroscopic level â€“ observed as increased respiratory illness, heatstroke, or the spread of infectious diseases.  Further research might explore how changes in electromagnetic radiation, albeit predominantly classical in nature, affect molecular processes relevant to human health, albeit the effects are likely to be subtle compared to the direct consequences of changed environmental parameters.  Thus, while not a primary explanatory framework, quantum mechanics provides a fundamental basis for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the impact of climate change on human health.
