Cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease, necessitating a personalized approach to treatment. While genomic sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of cancer's genetic basis, translating this knowledge into effective personalized medicine faces significant experimental challenges. This presentation will address key hurdles hindering progress.  One significant challenge lies in identifying truly driver mutations amongst the multitude of passenger mutations observed in cancer genomes.  Distinguishing causal from incidental alterations requires sophisticated computational analyses and functional validation, often hampered by the lack of robust in vitro and in vivo model systems accurately reflecting tumor heterogeneity.  Furthermore, the dynamic nature of cancer genomes, including intratumoral heterogeneity and the emergence of drug resistance mutations, poses substantial experimental difficulties in monitoring treatment response and predicting long-term outcomes.  Finally, access to comprehensive genomic data coupled with detailed clinical information, along with the ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and interpretation, remains a critical limitation.  We will discuss ongoing efforts to address these challenges, focusing on advancements in single-cell sequencing, functional genomics, and the development of more sophisticated computational tools aimed at improving the accuracy and efficacy of personalized cancer therapies.
