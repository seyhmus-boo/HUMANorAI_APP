Cancer's genetic basis has been progressively elucidated since the discovery of oncogenes in the 1970s, shifting our understanding from a purely environmental perspective to one emphasizing somatic mutations.  Early research focused on identifying proto-oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, revealing a multi-step process of carcinogenesis.  The Human Genome Project and subsequent advancements in high-throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized our ability to comprehensively profile tumour genomes, identifying a vast landscape of driver and passenger mutations. This detailed genomic information underpins the burgeoning field of personalized oncology.

Advances in personalized medicine utilize this genetic data to guide treatment selection.  For instance, identifying specific mutations in genes like EGFR or BRAF facilitates the targeted application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, offering improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy.  Furthermore, genomic profiling aids in predicting treatment response, enabling the selection of patients most likely to benefit from specific therapies and avoiding futile treatments.  While challenges remain, including the cost and complexity of comprehensive genomic analysis and the identification of actionable mutations, the genetic basis of cancer continues to drive progress in personalized medicine, offering the promise of more effective and tailored cancer care.
