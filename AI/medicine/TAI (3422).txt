Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting concerning upward trends globally.  Increased rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm are observed, often exacerbated by societal factors like social media pressure and academic stress.  Effective treatment necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, recognizing the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social influences.  Biological interventions, such as pharmacotherapy guided by psychiatrists, target neurochemical imbalances underlying disorders.  Psychological treatments, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT) delivered by psychologists or therapists, focus on modifying maladaptive thoughts and behaviors.  Crucially, social work input addresses systemic issues impacting mental well-being, such as family dynamics, school environment, and access to resources.  Successful interventions often integrate these approaches, for instance, utilizing CBT alongside medication management and family therapy to achieve holistic care.  Future research should focus on early identification strategies, culturally sensitive interventions, and improving accessibility to comprehensive, interdisciplinary services to mitigate the escalating burden of adolescent mental health disorders.
