Good morning.  Our understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine. Historically, cancer treatment was largely generalized, relying on cytotoxic therapies with significant side effects.  However, the discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes in the late 20th century fundamentally shifted this paradigm.  We now understand that cancer arises from accumulated genetic mutations affecting cell cycle regulation, DNA repair, and apoptosis.

Advances in genomics, particularly next-generation sequencing, have enabled the detailed profiling of individual tumors. This allows identification of specific driver mutations, informing targeted therapies. For example, the presence of EGFR mutations in lung cancer dictates the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Similarly, identifying BRCA mutations guides treatment decisions in breast and ovarian cancers.  This personalized approach, while still evolving, promises to increase treatment efficacy while minimizing toxicity, representing a significant leap forward from the one-size-fits-all treatments of the past.  Future research will focus on refining our understanding of the complex interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors to further personalize cancer care.
