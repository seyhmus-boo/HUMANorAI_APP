This presentation addresses the escalating prevalence of mental health disorders amongst adolescents, highlighting significant experimental challenges in research and treatment.  While advancements in understanding the neurobiological underpinnings of conditions like depression and anxiety are occurring, translating this knowledge into effective interventions remains a considerable hurdle.  We will explore the limitations of current methodologies, including the difficulties in reliably assessing subjective experiences in young people, the ethical considerations surrounding experimental treatments, and the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors. The inherent heterogeneity of adolescent populations, coupled with developmental changes in brain structure and function, poses substantial challenges for designing and interpreting randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Moreover, the long-term efficacy and potential adverse effects of interventions, particularly pharmacological ones, require prolonged and rigorous investigation. Finally, the presentation will discuss innovative approaches aimed at addressing these challenges, including the integration of longitudinal studies, sophisticated neuroimaging techniques, and personalized medicine strategies. We advocate for a more nuanced and integrated research approach to optimize the development and implementation of evidence-based treatments for adolescent mental health disorders.
