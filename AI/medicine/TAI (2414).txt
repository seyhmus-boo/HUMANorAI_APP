The escalating global crisis of antibiotic resistance poses a significant threat to public health, comparable to the looming threat of a worldwide pandemic.  Like a relentless arms race, the development of antibiotic resistance in pathogenic bacteria mirrors the evolutionary adaptation of prey to predator.  Each new antibiotic introduced represents a selective pressure, favouring the survival and proliferation of resistant strains. These resistant bacteria, analogous to an increasingly well-armoured enemy, can then withstand the very treatments designed to eradicate them.  The consequences are far-reaching: previously manageable infections, like pneumonia or urinary tract infections, become life-threatening, and routine medical procedures such as surgery or organ transplantation become significantly riskier.  This phenomenon transcends national borders; resistant bacteria are readily transported via international travel and trade, akin to the rapid spread of a highly infectious disease.  The resulting increase in morbidity and mortality places a substantial strain on healthcare systems worldwide, impacting not only patient care but also national economies.  If left unchecked, the unchecked spread of antibiotic resistance threatens to return us to a pre-antibiotic era, where even minor infections could prove fatal, highlighting the urgent need for global cooperation and responsible antibiotic stewardship.
