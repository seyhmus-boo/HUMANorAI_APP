This presentation examines emerging trends in adolescent mental health disorders, focusing on the increasing prevalence of anxiety and depression, alongside a rise in self-harm and eating disorders. We will analyze contributing factors, including societal pressures, technological influences, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  While acknowledging the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social determinants, the presentation will highlight effective treatment modalities currently available.  These include evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), alongside the judicious use of psychopharmacological interventions.  

The practical implications for clinicians and educators will be emphasized, focusing on early identification strategies, the importance of creating supportive school environments, and fostering collaborative care models involving families, schools, and healthcare providers.  We will discuss the limitations of current resources and explore innovative approaches to improve access to timely and appropriate care, including telehealth initiatives and the integration of mental health support within educational settings.  Finally, the presentation will conclude by emphasizing the critical need for continued research to inform policy and practice and ultimately improve the mental health outcomes for adolescents.
