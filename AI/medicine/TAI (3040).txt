The widespread use of antibiotics, commencing after World War II, dramatically altered infectious disease mortality.  However, this success has engendered a critical global health threat: antibiotic resistance.  Initially, bacterial resistance emerged sporadically, driven by spontaneous mutations.  Yet, the indiscriminate and often excessive prescription of antibiotics, coupled with their use in agriculture, has exponentially accelerated this process.

Today, resistant strains of bacteria, such as *Staphylococcus aureus* and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, pose significant challenges to healthcare systems worldwide. Infections caused by these resistant pathogens are more difficult and expensive to treat, leading to prolonged hospital stays, increased mortality, and substantial economic burdens.  The global implications are profound, impacting healthcare infrastructure, food security (through livestock production), and international travel.  Without concerted global action, including responsible antibiotic stewardship and the development of novel antimicrobial agents, we face a future where common infections become untreatable, reverting us to a pre-antibiotic era.
