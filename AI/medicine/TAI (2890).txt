Cancer's genetic basis has been a central focus of research since the discovery of oncogenes in the 1970s.  Early understanding centered on identifying specific mutations driving uncontrolled cell proliferation and tumorigenesis.  This knowledge facilitated the development of targeted therapies, representing a significant shift from traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy. Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized cancer genomics, enabling comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, transcriptomes, and epigenomes. This has revealed the remarkable heterogeneity within and between cancer types, highlighting the limitations of "one-size-fits-all" approaches.  Personalized medicine leverages this detailed genomic information to tailor treatment strategies to individual patients.  This includes selecting therapies based on the presence of specific driver mutations (e.g., EGFR inhibitors for EGFR-mutated lung cancer) and predicting treatment response and resistance. While significant progress has been made, challenges remain, including the identification of actionable mutations, managing treatment-related toxicities, and addressing the cost and accessibility of genomic testing. Future directions encompass the integration of multi-omics data with clinical information to improve diagnostic accuracy, predict prognosis, and optimize therapeutic strategies, ultimately realizing the full potential of personalized cancer medicine.
