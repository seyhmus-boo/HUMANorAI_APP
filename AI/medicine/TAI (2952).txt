Organ transplantation offers life-saving benefits but presents complex ethical dilemmas.  This abstract addresses key ethical considerations surrounding organ allocation, informed consent, and the donor-recipient relationship.  Just allocation systems grapple with balancing factors such as medical urgency, waiting time, and the potential for organ tourism, requiring transparent and equitable criteria.  Informed consent, particularly in cases of living donation, demands meticulous assessment of donor voluntariness, comprehension, and capacity to understand the risks involved.  Protecting vulnerable populations from coercion and exploitation is crucial, necessitating robust safeguards and independent ethical review.  The commercialization of organs raises profound ethical questions, potentially compromising the integrity of the system and exacerbating health disparities.  Practical applications include the development of improved allocation algorithms incorporating social equity indices, enhanced pre-donation counselling and support services, and stricter regulations to combat organ trafficking.  Addressing these ethical challenges is vital for ensuring equitable access to life-saving transplantation while maintaining public trust and upholding the principles of medical ethics.
