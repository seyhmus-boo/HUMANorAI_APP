Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's capacity to treat bacterial infections.  This presentation will explore the multifaceted nature of AR, encompassing the complex interplay of microbial evolution, antibiotic misuse, and global health systems.  We will examine the drivers of resistance development, including widespread antibiotic use in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and inadequate sanitation.  The presentation will highlight the profound implications of AR, projecting increased morbidity and mortality rates, extended hospital stays, and escalating healthcare costs globally, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.  Moreover, we will discuss the direct consequences for various sectors, including agriculture and food security.

Practical applications will focus on strategies for combating AR.  These include promoting responsible antibiotic stewardship programs across healthcare settings and agricultural practices, accelerating the development of novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapeutic approaches (e.g., phage therapy), and enhancing global surveillance and data sharing initiatives to monitor resistance patterns effectively.  We will also emphasize the importance of public health education campaigns to foster responsible antibiotic use amongst the general population.  Ultimately, a multi-sectoral, globally coordinated approach is crucial to mitigate the catastrophic consequences of antibiotic resistance.
