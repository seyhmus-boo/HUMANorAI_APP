Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, with significant implications for diagnostic procedures. This paper examines the multifaceted impact of AI on diagnostics across various medical specialties.  The integration of AI algorithms, particularly machine learning and deep learning models, offers the potential to enhance diagnostic accuracy, speed, and accessibility.  We analyze the existing literature on AI's application in medical imaging (radiology, pathology, ophthalmology),  genomics, and other diagnostic areas, exploring both the benefits and limitations of current implementations.  Specific focus is given to the impact on diagnostic performance, including sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value, as well as the effect on workflow efficiency and healthcare costs.  Furthermore, the ethical considerations surrounding AI in diagnostics, such as algorithmic bias, data privacy, and the responsibility for diagnostic errors, are critically addressed.  This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of AI in healthcare diagnostics, highlighting its transformative potential while acknowledging the challenges that need to be overcome for safe and equitable implementation.
