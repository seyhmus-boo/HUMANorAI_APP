Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using technology, has experienced a dramatic evolution from its rudimentary beginnings. Early iterations, dating back to the 1960s with NASA's experiments in space medicine, primarily focused on transmitting static images and basic physiological data.  Subsequent decades saw slow but steady technological advancements, enabling more sophisticated applications like remote monitoring and video consultations.  However, widespread adoption was hindered by limitations in bandwidth, interoperability, and reimbursement policies.

The COVID-19 pandemic served as a critical catalyst, necessitating a rapid expansion of telemedicine services to maintain access to care amid lockdowns and social distancing measures. This surge highlighted telemedicine's potential to overcome geographical barriers, improve access for underserved populations, and enhance patient convenience.  This presentation will explore the historical trajectory of telemedicine, analyzing its evolution from nascent technology to a pivotal component of modern healthcare delivery.  Furthermore, it will discuss the contemporary challenges and opportunities associated with telemedicine implementation, including issues of data security, regulatory compliance, and the equitable distribution of technological resources.  Finally, future directions for research and development will be briefly considered.
