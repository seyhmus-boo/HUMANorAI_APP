Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's ability to treat bacterial infections.  Its emergence is driven by selective pressure exerted by antibiotic overuse and misuse, promoting the evolution and spread of resistant strains.  Experimentally investigating AR presents several challenges.  Firstly, accurately modeling the complex interplay of bacterial evolution, antibiotic exposure, and host immunity in vivo is difficult, often relying on simplified in vitro models that may not fully capture the heterogeneity of bacterial populations and host-pathogen interactions. Secondly, characterizing the diverse mechanisms of resistance, including mutations, horizontal gene transfer, and efflux pumps, requires sophisticated genomic and proteomic techniques capable of identifying subtle phenotypic changes.  Moreover, predicting the emergence and spread of resistant strains presents a substantial computational challenge, necessitating the development of refined mathematical models incorporating spatial dynamics and diverse selection pressures. Finally, the evaluation of novel therapeutic strategies, such as phage therapy or antimicrobial peptides, faces hurdles related to efficacy, delivery, and potential toxicity. Overcoming these experimental limitations is crucial for developing effective countermeasures against the escalating global threat of AR.
