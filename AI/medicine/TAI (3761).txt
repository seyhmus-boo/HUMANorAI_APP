Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies (ICTs), has undergone a transformative evolution since its nascent stages in the 1960s, initially driven by the need to extend healthcare access to remote populations.  Early applications focused primarily on consultation and image transmission via slow, low-bandwidth connections.  Technological advancements, particularly in broadband internet access, mobile computing, and high-resolution imaging, have dramatically expanded telemedicine's capabilities.  Modern applications now encompass a wide range of services, including remote patient monitoring (RPM), telehealth consultations, teleradiology, and robotic surgery.  This expansion has demonstrably improved access to care, particularly for underserved and geographically isolated populations, while simultaneously enhancing efficiency and cost-effectiveness in healthcare delivery.  However, challenges remain, including concerns around data security, interoperability of systems, regulatory frameworks, and equitable access to technology, particularly for patients with limited digital literacy or socioeconomic resources.  Future research should prioritize addressing these barriers to fully realize telemedicine's potential to reshape modern healthcare and achieve universal health coverage.
