This presentation examines the evolving landscape of mental health disorders in adolescents, tracing historical trends and exploring contemporary treatment approaches. Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with limited recognition of distinct developmental challenges and inadequate diagnostic frameworks.  The 20th century witnessed a gradual increase in awareness, though stigma and a lack of accessible resources persisted.  Recent decades have shown a rise in the prevalence of anxiety and depression among young people, with contributing factors including social media pressures, academic stress, and societal changes.  This presentation will analyze these escalating rates, considering potential causative factors like increased awareness, improved diagnostic tools, and genuine societal shifts.  Furthermore, it will explore the effectiveness of various contemporary treatments, including evidence-based psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), as well as the role of medication and integrated care models.  Finally, the presentation will discuss the crucial need for improved early intervention strategies, destigmatization initiatives, and increased access to mental healthcare services tailored to the specific needs of adolescents.
