Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and mitigating its impacts. This presentation explores the complex interplay between climate change and public health outcomes, highlighting the crucial connections between environmental science, epidemiology, sociology, and public policy.  We will examine the direct effects of climate change, such as increased heat-related mortality, the spread of vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria, dengue fever), and the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to air pollution.  Furthermore, the indirect impacts, including mental health consequences of extreme weather events, displacement and migration patterns leading to health inequities, and food insecurity impacting nutritional status, will be discussed.  The presentation argues for a strengthened interdisciplinary collaboration, advocating for integrated research designs that incorporate environmental data with epidemiological studies, socioeconomic factors with health outcomes, and public health strategies with climate change mitigation and adaptation policies.  Ultimately, effective responses require a holistic understanding that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, fostering synergistic approaches to protect global public health in a changing climate.
