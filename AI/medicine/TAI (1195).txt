Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of antimicrobial drugs, poses a critical and escalating global threat.  This phenomenon transcends the boundaries of traditional disciplines, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  While primarily understood within the framework of microbiology and medicine, the complexity of AR necessitates collaboration across diverse fields. This research paper explores the multifaceted nature of AR and its profound global implications, emphasizing crucial interdisciplinary links. We examine the interplay between microbiology and evolutionary biology in understanding the mechanisms driving resistance development, alongside the socio-economic factors contributing to its proliferation.  The paper further investigates the role of environmental science in tracing the spread of resistant pathogens in various ecosystems, including the impact of agricultural practices and wastewater management.  Finally, we delve into the critical need for policy interventions that integrate public health, economics, and international collaborations to curb the global crisis of AR and secure sustainable healthcare solutions.  This integrated analysis highlights the urgent need for a holistic, interdisciplinary strategy to confront this significant threat to global health and wellbeing.
