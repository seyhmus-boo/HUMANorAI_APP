The pervasive impact of climate change extends far beyond ecological disruption, posing a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  While the epidemiological consequences are extensively documented, a deeper understanding necessitates exploring the underlying physical mechanisms at a fundamental level. This research paper proposes a novel approach, investigating the relationship between climate change and public health through the lens of quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate, the principles of quantum mechanics underpin many crucial biophysical processes affected by climate change.  For instance, the effects of increased UV radiation (a consequence of ozone depletion exacerbated by climate change) on DNA damage can be analysed using quantum chemical calculations to model photoinduced electron transfer and subsequent molecular modifications.  Furthermore, the altered distribution of infectious disease vectors, influenced by changing temperatures and precipitation patterns, can be linked to quantum phenomena influencing protein folding and enzyme activity within these pathogens. This study aims to explore these connections, examining how subtle quantum-level alterations in molecular structures and interactions, driven by climate change, manifest as macroscopic changes in public health outcomes, ultimately contributing to a more holistic and nuanced understanding of this critical nexus.  This will involve a review of existing literature alongside a discussion of potential avenues for future quantum-based modeling in this field.
