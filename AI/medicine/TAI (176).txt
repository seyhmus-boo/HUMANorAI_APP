Telemedicine has rapidly evolved from a niche application to a cornerstone of modern healthcare delivery. This presentation will explore the transformative impact of telemedicine, highlighting recent advancements and their implications for accessibility, efficiency, and patient outcomes.  We will examine the increasing utilization of remote patient monitoring (RPM) technologies, including wearable sensors and connected devices, enabling proactive healthcare management and early intervention for chronic conditions.  The presentation will further discuss the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in telehealth platforms, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, personalized treatment plans, and predictive analytics for population health management.  Recent regulatory changes and reimbursement models facilitating wider adoption of telemedicine will also be reviewed.  Finally, we will critically assess the challenges remaining, such as addressing digital health literacy disparities, ensuring data privacy and security, and maintaining the quality of care across geographical and socioeconomic boundaries.  The presentation concludes by outlining future directions for telemedicine research and implementation, emphasizing its potential to reshape healthcare systems globally.
