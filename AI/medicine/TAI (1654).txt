Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to understand and mitigate its impacts. This presentation explores the complex relationship between a changing climate and human health outcomes, highlighting the critical need for collaboration across disciplines.  We will examine the direct impacts of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, on morbidity and mortality, alongside indirect effects like the altered distribution of infectious diseases (e.g., vector-borne illnesses) and the exacerbation of air pollution-related respiratory illnesses.  Further, the presentation will discuss the social determinants of health, demonstrating how climate change disproportionately affects vulnerable populations and exacerbates existing health inequalities. This necessitates engagement from epidemiologists, climatologists, sociologists, economists, and public health policymakers to develop effective adaptation and mitigation strategies.  We argue that fostering interdisciplinary research, fostering effective communication across sectors, and implementing integrated solutions are crucial for building climate-resilient healthcare systems and safeguarding public health in the face of a changing climate.  The presentation will conclude with a discussion of promising avenues for future interdisciplinary research and collaboration.
