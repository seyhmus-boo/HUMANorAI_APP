Mental health disorders among adolescents represent a significant and growing public health concern.  Trends indicate a rise in diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors, particularly amongst female adolescents and those from marginalized communities.  Contributing factors are multifaceted and encompass societal pressures, rapid developmental changes, increased screen time, and the impact of social media.  Treatment approaches are increasingly tailored to this age group, emphasizing evidence-based interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and family-based therapies.  Pharmacological interventions, though often employed, are generally considered adjunctive to psychotherapy and require careful consideration due to potential long-term effects.  Practical applications for healthcare providers include implementing early screening tools in schools and primary care settings, promoting mental health literacy amongst adolescents and their families, and ensuring access to age-appropriate and culturally competent therapeutic services.  Furthermore, fostering supportive school environments and promoting positive youth development initiatives contribute significantly to preventative strategies and improved mental health outcomes.  Research continues to explore the effectiveness of various interventions and the long-term impact of adolescent mental health challenges on adult well-being.
