Ethical considerations surrounding organ transplantation are deeply interwoven with its historical development. Early transplants, often experimental and lacking robust ethical frameworks, raised concerns about informed consent and the equitable allocation of scarce resources.  The infamous era of procurement from executed prisoners in some countries highlighted the vulnerability of marginalized populations and the potential for coercion.  The emergence of national organ procurement and transplantation networks in the latter half of the 20th century sought to address these issues, establishing criteria for organ allocation based on medical urgency and need rather than social standing.  However, persistent ethical dilemmas remain.  The ongoing debate regarding the definition of death, particularly brain death, continues to spark controversy.  Furthermore, the allocation of organs often faces criticism due to inequalities in access based on socioeconomic factors, geographic location, and race.  The ethical implications of living donation, including the potential for exploitation and undue influence on vulnerable family members, necessitate stringent safeguards.  Ultimately, a comprehensive ethical framework for organ transplantation must navigate the complex interplay between individual autonomy, societal justice, and the imperative to maximize the benefits of this life-saving technology.
