Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, is rapidly transforming modern healthcare delivery.  This abstract reviews the expanding role of telemedicine in addressing challenges such as geographical limitations, healthcare workforce shortages, and increasing healthcare costs.  Studies demonstrate telemedicine's effectiveness across various specialties, including cardiology, mental health, and chronic disease management, offering comparable outcomes to in-person care for many conditions.  Its advantages include enhanced patient access, improved convenience, and reduced travel burdens, particularly beneficial for patients in rural or underserved areas.  However, challenges persist, including issues related to digital literacy, technological infrastructure limitations, regulatory hurdles, and concerns regarding data privacy and security.  Future research should focus on optimizing telemedicine platforms, standardizing clinical protocols, and addressing equity concerns to fully realize its potential for improving health outcomes and achieving universal access to quality care.  The integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning holds promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy and personalizing treatment plans within the telemedicine framework.
