Climate change significantly impacts public health, posing a complex and multifaceted challenge.  The relationship is bidirectional, with climate change exacerbating existing health risks and generating novel ones.  Rising temperatures contribute directly to heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly amongst vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns influence the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, altering their geographical distribution and incidence.  Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, lead to injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences stemming from trauma and loss.  Furthermore,  air pollution, worsened by climate change-induced wildfires and industrial emissions, exacerbates respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.

Practical applications for mitigating these risks include targeted public health interventions. This encompasses improving early warning systems for extreme weather, enhancing surveillance of infectious diseases, developing heat action plans for vulnerable communities, and investing in climate-resilient healthcare infrastructure.  Furthermore, promoting sustainable urban design, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and advocating for climate-conscious policy are crucial for preventing future health burdens.  A holistic approach, integrating climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies within public health planning, is essential to safeguard population health in a changing climate.
