Adolescence, a period of significant physical, cognitive, and emotional development, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and manifestation of mental health disorders.  Historically, mental health challenges in young people were often overlooked or misattributed, with limited understanding of their unique developmental trajectory and underlying mechanisms.  Early conceptualizations frequently lacked the nuanced diagnostic categories and treatment approaches available today.  However, growing awareness in recent decades has led to a surge in research into the prevalence, etiology, and effective interventions for adolescent mental health issues. This paper investigates the evolving trends in mental health disorders among adolescents, examining both the shifting prevalence rates of specific conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, and the influence of societal factors such as social media and academic pressures. Furthermore, we will explore contemporary treatment approaches, including pharmacological interventions, psychotherapy (e.g., cognitive behavioral therapy, dialectical behavior therapy), and family-based therapies, analyzing their efficacy and limitations in the context of adolescent development.  This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of adolescent mental health, highlighting both progress and persistent challenges in diagnosis and treatment.
