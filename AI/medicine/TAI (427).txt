Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant global public health concern, with increasing prevalence observed in recent decades.  Historically, understanding of adolescent mental health lagged behind adult psychiatry, often overlooking the unique developmental vulnerabilities of this age group.  Early approaches were largely characterized by institutionalization and limited therapeutic options.  However, advancements in neuroscience, developmental psychology, and evidence-based practice have transformed the field.  Current trends indicate a rise in anxiety and depression diagnoses, alongside concerning increases in self-harm and suicidal ideation, particularly amongst girls. This may reflect societal factors like increased academic pressure and social media influence, warranting further research into environmental contributors. Treatment approaches now encompass a range of evidence-based interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacology, tailored to the specific developmental stage and presenting symptoms.  Integrated care models, emphasizing collaborative efforts between mental health professionals, educators, and families, are increasingly advocated to optimize outcomes and address the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors influencing adolescent mental health. Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies examining the long-term impact of early interventions and the effectiveness of novel therapeutic strategies, particularly in addressing health disparities.
