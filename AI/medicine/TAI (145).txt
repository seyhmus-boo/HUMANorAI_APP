Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times compared to traditional open surgery.  This paper explores the significant evolution of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, tracing its trajectory from early pioneering efforts to the sophisticated technologies employed today.  We examine the key technological advancements that have driven this evolution, focusing on the development and refinement of instruments, imaging modalities, and energy sources.  Particular attention is given to the transition from early laparoscopic approaches, hampered by limited dexterity and visualization, to the current era of robotic-assisted surgery and advanced imaging techniques like augmented reality.  Furthermore, the paper analyses the impact of these evolving techniques on surgical outcomes, including reduced morbidity and mortality rates, improved precision, and enhanced patient satisfaction.  Finally, we discuss emerging trends and future directions in MIS, including the potential for artificial intelligence and further miniaturization of surgical instruments to further refine the field and expand its applications across diverse surgical specialties.
