Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This paradigm shift, however, has not been without its challenges, particularly within the realm of experimental research. This paper examines the evolution of surgical techniques in MIS, focusing on the inherent complexities of translating laboratory innovations into clinically applicable procedures.  The transition from open to laparoscopic and robotic surgery has necessitated the development of specialized instruments, imaging modalities, and training methodologies, each presenting unique experimental hurdles.  Simulating the complex in vivo environment, replicating the dexterity and precision required for MIS, and accurately assessing long-term outcomes in pre-clinical models remain significant obstacles. Furthermore, the heterogeneous nature of surgical procedures and patient populations complicates the standardization of experimental protocols and the interpretation of results.  This research explores these experimental challenges, critically reviewing advancements in simulation technology, biomaterial development, and pre-clinical model design, and ultimately proposing avenues for enhancing the translational efficacy of MIS research.
