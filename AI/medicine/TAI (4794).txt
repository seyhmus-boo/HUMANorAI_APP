Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transitions, is marked by a heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders. This paper examines recent trends in the prevalence and presentation of common mental health disorders among adolescents, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  We analyze data from epidemiological studies and national surveys to identify emerging patterns and disparities across various demographic and socioeconomic groups.  While traditional evidence-based treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and medication remain crucial, this review also explores the growing interest in and efficacy of novel therapeutic approaches, such as mindfulness-based interventions, digital mental health platforms, and integrated care models.  The implications of these trends for mental health service provision are discussed, highlighting the need for early identification, accessible and affordable care, and culturally sensitive interventions tailored to the specific needs of adolescents.  Ultimately, this paper aims to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the evolving landscape of adolescent mental health, informing the development of more effective prevention and intervention strategies.
