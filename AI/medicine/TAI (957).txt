Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical skills.  Early MIS, primarily laparoscopy, relied on 2D imaging and rigid instrumentation, limiting dexterity and precision.  The subsequent development of robotic surgery offered enhanced visualization through 3D high-definition cameras and articulated instruments, translating to improved dexterity and ergonomics for surgeons.  Simultaneously, the refinement of energy sources, including lasers and ultrasonic shears, enabled more precise tissue dissection and hemostasis.  Advances in advanced imaging techniques, such as fluorescence imaging and intraoperative 3D ultrasound, further enhance visualization and surgical planning.  Currently, the field is exploring novel approaches including single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), striving for even smaller incisions and less trauma.  Future directions include the integration of artificial intelligence for improved surgical planning and real-time assistance, potentially leading to increased precision, reduced complications, and improved patient outcomes.
