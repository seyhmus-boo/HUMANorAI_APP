Adolescents experience a disproportionately high prevalence of mental health disorders (MHDs), with trends indicating a concerning rise in anxiety and depression.  This increase may be attributed to a confluence of factors including societal pressures, technological advancements impacting social interaction, and evolving family structures.  Diagnostic challenges exist due to the developmental stage, with symptoms often manifesting differently than in adults, requiring nuanced assessment tools.  Treatment approaches, informed by neurobiological and psychosocial models, emphasize evidence-based interventions tailored to the developmental context.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) demonstrate efficacy in addressing anxiety and mood disorders.  Pharmacological interventions, though utilized, require careful consideration of potential side effects and developmental implications.  Integrated care models, combining therapy and medication management with family and peer support, are increasingly advocated to optimize outcomes.  Further research focusing on early intervention, prevention strategies targeting risk factors, and culturally sensitive treatment approaches is crucial to mitigate the escalating burden of MHDs in adolescents.
