Organ transplantation represents a significant advancement in modern medicine, offering life-saving and life-enhancing opportunities for individuals suffering from end-stage organ failure.  However, the inherent scarcity of donor organs necessitates a complex system of allocation and prioritization, raising profound ethical dilemmas. This paper examines the multifaceted ethical considerations surrounding organ transplantation, focusing on three key areas:  the equitable allocation of scarce resources, the definition and determination of brain death, and the potential for coercion and exploitation in living donation.  We analyze existing ethical frameworks and guidelines, highlighting their strengths and limitations in addressing the challenges posed by these issues.  Furthermore, we explore the evolving landscape of organ procurement, including the increasing role of innovative technologies and the potential impact of these advancements on ethical decision-making.  The paper concludes by suggesting potential strategies for enhancing ethical practices within organ transplantation, emphasizing the need for a robust, transparent, and equitable system that prioritizes patient welfare and safeguards the integrity of the process.
