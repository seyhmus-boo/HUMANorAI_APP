The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine. Early research, focusing on identifying oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, laid the groundwork for understanding the molecular mechanisms driving carcinogenesis.  Landmark studies, such as the identification of the *BRCA1* and *BRCA2* genes, highlighted the role of inherited genetic predispositions in certain cancers.

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have dramatically accelerated progress.  Whole-genome and exome sequencing now allow for comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, identifying numerous somatic mutations, copy number variations, and other genomic alterations specific to individual tumors. This information is crucial for guiding treatment decisions.  Personalized medicine utilizes this genomic data to select targeted therapies, predict treatment response, and monitor disease progression, improving patient outcomes and minimizing adverse effects.  However, challenges remain, including the cost and complexity of NGS, the interpretation of complex genomic data, and the need for further research to identify effective therapeutic targets for all cancer types.  Despite these challenges, the ongoing integration of genomic information promises a future of more effective and individualized cancer treatment.
