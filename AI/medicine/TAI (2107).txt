Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, driven by advancements across multiple disciplines. This presentation traces the evolution of MIS techniques, highlighting the crucial interplay between engineering, materials science, and medicine.  Early laparoscopic procedures, limited by instrumentation and imaging, have given way to sophisticated robotic-assisted and single-port approaches, facilitated by advancements in robotic dexterity, high-definition 3D imaging, and improved ergonomic instrument design.  The development of novel biocompatible materials, including sutureless closure techniques and biodegradable implants, has further minimized invasiveness and improved patient outcomes.  Crucially, this progress has been fostered by strong interdisciplinary collaborations.  Biomedical engineers have played a pivotal role in developing new tools and technologies, while surgeons have driven the clinical translation and refinement of these techniques.  Data scientists, contributing to improved surgical planning through advanced imaging analysis and predictive modeling, also represent a burgeoning area of interdisciplinary cooperation. This presentation will explore specific examples of these collaborations, demonstrating how interdisciplinary links have been and continue to be essential for driving innovation and improving the safety and efficacy of MIS.  The future of MIS will undoubtedly hinge on continued interdisciplinary synergy, pushing the boundaries of what is surgically achievable.
