Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, a relationship often overlooked despite its profound implications.  This presentation will explore this complex interplay using accessible analogies to illustrate key mechanisms.  Consider climate change as a potent amplifier of existing health vulnerabilities: just as a fever exacerbates underlying illnesses, rising temperatures exacerbate pre-existing conditions like cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, leading to increased mortality and morbidity, especially among vulnerable populations.  Further, shifting weather patterns, analogous to a disrupted ecosystem, disrupt disease vectors, leading to altered geographic distributions of infectious diseases like malaria and dengue fever.  Extreme weather events, akin to unpredictable natural disasters, directly cause injuries, displacement, and mental health trauma, while also disrupting access to healthcare infrastructure.  Finally, food insecurity, comparable to a resource depletion crisis, emerges from climate-related agricultural failures, contributing to malnutrition and associated health problems.  This presentation will outline these interconnected pathways, emphasizing the urgent need for integrated climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies to protect public health globally.  We will conclude by suggesting avenues for impactful public health interventions in the face of a changing climate.
