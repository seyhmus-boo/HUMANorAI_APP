Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine and public health infrastructure.  This presentation will examine the multifaceted drivers of AR, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, and the dissemination of resistant genes through various environmental reservoirs.  The consequences of unchecked AR are dire, potentially rendering common infections untreatable and increasing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs globally.  We will explore the current landscape of AR surveillance and its limitations, highlighting the critical need for improved data collection and standardization across nations.  Practical applications of strategies to combat AR will be discussed, encompassing responsible antibiotic stewardship programs, the development and implementation of novel diagnostic tools for rapid identification of resistant pathogens, the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies such as phage therapy and antimicrobial peptides, and the promotion of effective infection prevention and control measures.  Finally, the presentation will emphasize the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration and international cooperation in mitigating the global impact of this critical challenge.
