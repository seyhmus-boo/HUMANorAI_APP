Cancer, a complex and heterogeneous group of diseases, arises from the accumulation of genetic alterations within somatic cells.  While significant progress has been made in understanding the genetic basis of cancer, translating this knowledge into effective personalized medicine remains a considerable challenge. This research paper explores the experimental hurdles hindering the full realization of personalized cancer therapies driven by genetic profiling.  Specifically, we examine the limitations of current genomic technologies in comprehensively capturing the dynamic and evolving mutational landscape of individual tumors.  The inherent heterogeneity within and between tumors, including spatial heterogeneity and the presence of subclones, poses a significant challenge to accurate genetic characterization and targeted therapeutic intervention.  Furthermore,  the complexities of interpreting genomic data, including identifying driver mutations from passenger mutations and predicting therapeutic response based on genetic profiles, are discussed. Finally, we address the limitations of existing preclinical models in accurately reflecting the complexity of human cancers and their response to therapy, highlighting the need for innovative approaches to improve the translation of genomic discoveries into effective personalized treatment strategies.
