Good morning.  Today's lecture concerns the genetic basis of cancer and its implications for personalized medicine.  Cancer, fundamentally, is a disease of the genome.  Imagine the genome as a meticulously written instruction manual for the body.  Cancer arises from errors – mutations – within this manual, leading to uncontrolled cell growth.  These mutations can be inherited, akin to receiving a flawed instruction manual from your parents, or acquired throughout life due to environmental factors, like someone scribbling illegible notes on a pristine copy.

Advances in genomics allow us to decipher these "errors" with increasing precision.  Think of it like having access to a high-resolution scanner capable of identifying even minor typos in the instruction manual. This detailed genomic profiling allows us to identify the specific genetic alterations driving a patient's cancer, enabling targeted therapies.  This is the essence of personalized medicine: tailoring treatment to the unique genetic fingerprint of the tumour, akin to prescribing different corrective measures for different types of typos.  For example, if we find a specific gene mutation driving tumour growth, we can deploy drugs specifically designed to target that mutation, maximizing efficacy and minimizing side effects compared to broad-spectrum chemotherapies. This precision approach represents a significant leap forward in cancer treatment.
