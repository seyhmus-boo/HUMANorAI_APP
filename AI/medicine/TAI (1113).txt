Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are complex and multifaceted, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective navigation. This presentation explores the key ethical dilemmas arising within this critical area of healthcare, highlighting the crucial contributions of various disciplines. We will examine the allocation of scarce resources, focusing on the tension between utilitarian principles of maximizing benefit and deontological concerns regarding individual rights and justice.  The role of informed consent, particularly in vulnerable populations and situations of urgency, will be analyzed, underscoring the need for robust legal and ethical frameworks.  Further, we will discuss the psychological and sociological implications for both donors and recipients, including the impact of grief and trauma on donor families and the challenges of adaptation and integration for transplant recipients. The presentation will emphasize the vital intersection of medical ethics, law, sociology, psychology, and public health, showcasing how interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for developing and implementing equitable and ethically sound organ transplantation policies and practices that promote both individual well-being and societal justice.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the emerging ethical challenges posed by innovative technologies like xenotransplantation.
