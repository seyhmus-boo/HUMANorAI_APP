Climate change poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health.  Historically, variations in climate have influenced disease patterns, with periods of warming and drought correlating with outbreaks of infectious diseases like cholera and plague.  However, the current anthropogenic climate change presents a qualitatively different challenge, characterized by an unprecedented rate and scale of environmental disruption.  Rising temperatures exacerbate the spread of vector-borne illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever, while extreme weather events – floods, heatwaves, and wildfires – directly cause injury, mortality, and displacement, increasing the burden on healthcare systems.  Furthermore, climate change impacts food security and water resources, leading to malnutrition and increased vulnerability to infectious diseases.  Indirect effects, such as mental health consequences from displacement and climate-related trauma, are also emerging.  Research increasingly demonstrates a strong causal link between climate change and a multitude of health outcomes, emphasizing the urgent need for mitigation strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation measures to protect vulnerable populations and strengthen healthcare resilience.  Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial to effectively address this complex and evolving public health crisis.
