Antibiotic resistance presents a formidable global health challenge, threatening the efficacy of modern medicine.  While the clinical implications are widely understood, research into effective countermeasures is hampered by significant experimental limitations.  Studies often struggle with the inherent complexity of microbial communities, where resistance mechanisms are not isolated but interact within intricate ecological networks.  Accurately modelling these interactions *in vitro* remains a substantial hurdle, with simplified models failing to capture the dynamism of real-world scenarios.  Furthermore, the development of novel antibiotics is slow and costly, demanding high-throughput screening methodologies that can efficiently identify and characterize new compounds amidst vast chemical libraries.  Preclinical testing is further complicated by the need for robust animal models that realistically reflect human infection dynamics and the emergence of resistance.  Finally, the lack of standardized methodologies for evaluating resistance profiles across different laboratories contributes to inconsistent data and hinders the comparison of research findings. Overcoming these experimental challenges is crucial to developing effective strategies to combat the escalating threat of antibiotic resistance.
