Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This advancement, however, has not been without its experimental challenges.  While the clinical benefits are undeniable, translating innovative surgical techniques from the laboratory to the operating room presents a complex interplay of technological limitations, biological complexities, and ethical considerations. This paper explores the evolution of surgical techniques within the MIS field, specifically highlighting the significant experimental hurdles encountered at each stage of development.  We will examine the difficulties in replicating the in vivo human environment in pre-clinical models, encompassing issues such as the limitations of animal models and the development of realistic tissue phantoms.  Further, we will analyze the challenges posed by the inherent limitations of current imaging and robotic technologies, particularly in relation to dexterity, precision, and real-time feedback.  Finally, the paper will discuss the ongoing efforts to address these experimental challenges and the potential future directions for advancing MIS techniques, focusing on the integration of artificial intelligence and advanced materials.  Understanding these obstacles is crucial for fostering further advancements and ensuring the safe and effective translation of innovative MIS procedures.
