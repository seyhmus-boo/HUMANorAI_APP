Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the burgeoning field of personalized oncology, driven by advancements in our understanding of cancer's genetic basis.  Historically, cancer treatment was largely generalised.  However, the advent of high-throughput sequencing has revolutionized our approach, revealing the complex interplay of somatic mutations, genomic instability, and epigenetic modifications driving tumour development.

Recent developments highlight the crucial role of identifying specific driver mutations within a patient's tumour. This allows for the targeted application of therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for specific mutations in lung cancer or immune checkpoint inhibitors for cancers expressing PD-L1.  Furthermore, liquid biopsies, analyzing circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), offer minimally invasive methods for monitoring disease progression and treatment response, enabling real-time adjustments to therapy.  While challenges remain in deciphering complex mutational landscapes and predicting treatment efficacy, the integration of genomic data into clinical decision-making represents a significant leap towards truly personalized cancer care.  This personalized approach promises improved outcomes and reduced toxicity compared to traditional, broad-spectrum treatments.
