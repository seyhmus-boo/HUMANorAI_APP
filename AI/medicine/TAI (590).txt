Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach encompassing microbiology, medicine, public health, social sciences, and environmental science.  The escalating prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens necessitates a holistic understanding of resistance mechanisms, encompassing genetic mutations, horizontal gene transfer, and selective pressure exerted by antibiotic overuse in human and animal healthcare, as well as agriculture.  This abstract highlights the critical interconnections between these disciplines.  Infectious disease epidemiology requires robust surveillance systems to track AR patterns and inform public health interventions.  Social sciences are crucial for addressing behavioural factors driving antibiotic misuse, informing policy and communication strategies promoting responsible antibiotic stewardship.  Environmental microbiology investigates the role of antibiotic residues in the environment as reservoirs of resistance genes, underscoring the need for integrated wastewater management and agricultural practices.  A One Health approach, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, is paramount for developing effective, sustainable strategies to combat AR.  Interdisciplinary collaborations are vital for fostering innovative solutions, including developing novel antibiotics, alternative therapies, and robust diagnostic tools to mitigate the looming crisis of untreatable infections.
