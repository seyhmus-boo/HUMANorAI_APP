Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, with increasing prevalence rates observed across numerous diagnoses including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders. These trends are multifaceted, influenced by societal factors like increased academic pressure, social media usage, and socioeconomic disparities. Effective treatment necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, recognizing the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social influences.  Psychiatrists provide medication management and diagnosis, while psychologists offer evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to address maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors.  Social workers contribute by navigating family dynamics, addressing systemic barriers to care, and connecting adolescents with crucial support services within the community.  Furthermore, school counselors play a vital role in early identification, intervention, and fostering a supportive school environment.  This collaborative model, integrating the expertise of professionals across multiple disciplines, optimizes treatment outcomes by comprehensively addressing the individual's unique needs within their broader context.  Future research should focus on strengthening interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly in enhancing communication and coordinated care pathways to ensure timely and effective interventions for adolescents experiencing mental health challenges.
