Organ transplantation, while a life-saving marvel, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  Consider the allocation of organs â€“ a scarce resource akin to a life raft in a shipwreck.  Determining who receives this life-saving "raft" necessitates a framework that transcends mere first-come, first-served.  Utilitarian approaches, prioritizing the greatest good for the greatest number, might favour younger patients with higher life expectancy.  However, this could be seen as unfairly disadvantaging older individuals, akin to choosing to save those most likely to contribute further to society, potentially neglecting inherent human worth.

Furthermore, the procurement process raises concerns.  While presumed consent models, where individuals are considered donors unless they explicitly opt out, increase organ availability, they potentially infringe on individual autonomy, akin to assuming someone wants to donate their car without explicit confirmation.  Conversely, mandated choice models, requiring individuals to actively decide, might inadvertently discourage donation through perceived coercion.  Therefore, navigating these ethical shoals requires a delicate balancing act between maximizing societal benefit and respecting individual rights and autonomy.
