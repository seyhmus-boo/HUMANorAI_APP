Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, undermining the efficacy of life-saving treatments for bacterial infections. Driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, AR manifests in diverse bacterial pathogens, impacting morbidity and mortality worldwide.  This phenomenon exhibits complex dynamics, with horizontal gene transfer facilitating the rapid spread of resistance mechanisms across bacterial species and geographic regions. Consequently, treatment of common infections becomes increasingly challenging, leading to prolonged hospital stays, higher healthcare costs, and increased mortality rates, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to effective alternatives.  The economic burden extends beyond healthcare, impacting agricultural productivity and global food security.  Effective mitigation strategies necessitate a multi-pronged approach encompassing strengthened surveillance systems, responsible antibiotic stewardship programs, development and deployment of novel antimicrobials and alternative therapies, and investment in sanitation and hygiene infrastructure.  International collaboration and policy harmonization are crucial to effectively address this global crisis and prevent the emergence of untreatable infections.
