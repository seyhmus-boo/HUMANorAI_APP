Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, with increasing prevalence rates observed globally across various diagnostic categories.  Anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety, and depressive disorders, encompassing major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder, are particularly prevalent.  Furthermore, there's a concerning rise in self-harm and suicidal ideation among this demographic, often intertwined with other pre-existing conditions.  These trends are influenced by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors, including genetic predisposition, stressful life events, peer pressure, and societal pressures related to academic achievement and social media usage.  Treatment approaches commonly integrate evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), tailored to the specific needs and developmental stage of the adolescent.  Pharmacological interventions, including antidepressants and anti-anxiety medications, may also be utilized under careful medical supervision.  Practical application necessitates early identification through school-based screening programs and improved access to mental health services, including readily available therapeutic resources and community support networks.  Furthermore, promoting mental health literacy amongst adolescents, parents, and educators is crucial for fostering a supportive environment and reducing stigma surrounding seeking help.
