Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, extending beyond the traditionally recognized impacts of extreme weather events. This research paper examines the complex and evolving relationship between climate change and public health outcomes, exploring both direct and indirect pathways of influence.  Direct effects include increased morbidity and mortality from heat stress, the expansion of vector-borne diseases, and the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to air pollution.  Indirect impacts encompass malnutrition stemming from agricultural disruptions, mental health challenges arising from displacement and trauma associated with climate-related disasters, and the increased burden on healthcare systems struggling to cope with climate-sensitive diseases.

This study will analyze the existing literature to identify key vulnerabilities and health risks associated with various climate change impacts.  Furthermore, it will explore the practical applications of this research, focusing on the development of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies.  These include improving early warning systems for extreme weather events, enhancing surveillance and control of infectious diseases, implementing public health interventions to address heat-related illnesses, and advocating for policies that support climate-resilient healthcare systems.  Ultimately, a deeper understanding of the climate-health nexus is crucial for formulating evidence-based policies and interventions to protect vulnerable populations and build more resilient communities in the face of a changing climate.
