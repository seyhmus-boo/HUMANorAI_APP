Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution, transitioning from rudimentary laparoscopic approaches to sophisticated robotic and image-guided techniques.  Early MIS, characterized by limited instrumentation and visualization, primarily focused on reducing incision size.  Technological advancements have significantly broadened its capabilities.  The introduction of enhanced visualization systems, including high-definition cameras and 3D imaging, improved surgeon dexterity and precision.  Robotic surgery, with its articulated instruments and magnified, tremor-filtered movements, further refined manipulation within confined spaces.  Simultaneously, advancements in energy sources (e.g., ultrasonic shears, bipolar forceps) and suture techniques have facilitated improved hemostasis and tissue dissection.  Image-guided navigation, integrating pre-operative imaging with real-time intraoperative data, enables more accurate targeting and reduces complications.  This continuous technological innovation has expanded the range of surgical procedures amenable to MIS, resulting in reduced patient morbidity, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  Future directions include further miniaturization, improved haptic feedback, and the integration of artificial intelligence for enhanced precision and automation.
