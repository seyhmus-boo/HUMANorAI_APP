Organ transplantation, a life-saving medical marvel, is fraught with significant ethical complexities.  Historically, early transplants were plagued by issues of informed consent, often lacking due to the urgency of the situation and the power imbalance between physician and patient.  The infamous era of "transplant tourism," where individuals travelled to countries with lax regulations, further highlighted the ethical vulnerabilities.  The development of national organ procurement organizations aimed to address these issues by establishing structured systems and prioritizing equitable allocation. However, challenges persist.

Contemporary ethical dilemmas centre around the definition of death, particularly brain death, and the fairness of allocation systems.  The scarcity of organs necessitates difficult choices, often relying on waiting lists prioritized by medical urgency and factors like blood type and tissue compatibility. This raises concerns about distributive justice, potentially disadvantaging certain demographic groups. Furthermore, the financial burden of transplantation and the potential for coercion or exploitation of vulnerable donors remain critical issues.  Ongoing debates concern the ethics of living donation, particularly altruistic donation, and the extent to which potential risks to the donor should be weighed against the recipient's potential benefit.  Addressing these ethical complexities requires a multidisciplinary approach involving medical professionals, ethicists, policymakers, and the wider public.
