Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's capacity to treat bacterial infections. This presentation will explore the multifaceted nature of AR and its far-reaching implications.  Recent developments underscore the urgency of addressing this crisis.  The rise of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens, particularly concerning Gram-negative bacteria, highlights the limitations of existing antibiotic classes and necessitates the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies.  Advances in genomic surveillance, including whole-genome sequencing, are improving our understanding of resistance mechanisms and transmission dynamics, enabling better prediction and targeted interventions.  However, the complex interplay of factors driving AR, including overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal health, alongside inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, demands a multi-sectoral approach.  This presentation will discuss recent breakthroughs in novel antibiotic discovery, alternative therapeutic approaches (e.g., bacteriophage therapy, immunotherapies), and the crucial role of stewardship initiatives in mitigating the spread of resistance.  Finally, it will emphasize the need for global collaboration and coordinated strategies to combat this global health security threat and ensure the continued effectiveness of antibiotics.
