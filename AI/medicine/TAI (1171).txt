Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with issues attributed to "teenage angst" rather than diagnosable disorders.  However, recent decades have witnessed a significant rise in the prevalence of conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders among this population.  This increase is likely multifactorial, influenced by societal pressures, increased screen time, and evolving understanding of mental illness.

Current trends reveal a growing recognition of the unique challenges adolescents face, leading to more specialized treatment approaches.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are prominent evidence-based therapies, focusing on cognitive restructuring and coping skills development.  Pharmacotherapy, while controversial in adolescence, plays a role in managing severe symptoms, often used in conjunction with psychotherapy.  Early intervention is crucial, as untreated mental health disorders can have long-term consequences impacting academic achievement, social relationships, and overall well-being. Future research needs to focus on preventative measures and refining culturally sensitive treatment modalities.
