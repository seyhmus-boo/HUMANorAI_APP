Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  Rising temperatures exacerbate existing health problems, including heatstroke, cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, and infectious diseases.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to waterborne diseases and malnutrition through impacts on agricultural yields and food security.  Extreme weather events, such as floods, droughts, and wildfires, cause direct injury and mortality, disrupt healthcare systems, and displace populations, increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases and mental health issues.  Vector-borne diseases, like malaria and dengue fever, are projected to expand their geographical ranges with shifting climatic zones.  Furthermore, air pollution exacerbated by climate change contributes to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease.  Understanding the complex interplay between these climate-related hazards and population vulnerability is crucial for developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies. This necessitates a transdisciplinary approach integrating climate science, public health, and social sciences to inform policy and enhance resilience.
