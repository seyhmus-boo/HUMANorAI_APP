Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell's genome, disrupting critical cellular processes such as growth control and apoptosis.  Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, enabling comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes. This has revealed a remarkable heterogeneity in the mutational landscape across cancer types and even within individual tumors, highlighting the limitations of traditional, one-size-fits-all therapeutic approaches.  Personalized medicine leverages this genomic information to tailor treatment strategies to the specific genetic alterations present in a patient's tumor.  This includes targeted therapies, designed to inhibit specific oncogenic drivers identified through genomic sequencing, such as EGFR inhibitors in lung cancer or BRAF inhibitors in melanoma.  Furthermore, immunotherapies, like checkpoint inhibitors, are increasingly employed, exploiting the tumor's unique mutational signature to enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells.  Ongoing research focuses on integrating genomic data with other -omics data, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to develop more precise and effective predictive biomarkers, ultimately refining treatment strategies and improving patient outcomes. The continued refinement of NGS and bioinformatic analysis remains pivotal in driving progress within personalized cancer medicine.
