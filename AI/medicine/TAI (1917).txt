Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns exacerbate waterborne diseases and vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever, with shifting geographic ranges impacting disease prevalence.  Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, lead to immediate casualties, injuries, and displacement, further straining healthcare systems and increasing the risk of infectious disease outbreaks in overcrowded emergency shelters.  Indirect effects include malnutrition due to disrupted food production and economic instability, leading to increased susceptibility to disease. Air pollution, worsened by climate change, contributes to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular diseases.  Moreover, mental health consequences, arising from trauma, displacement, and the psychological stress of living in a changing climate, are increasingly recognized.  Understanding these complex interrelationships is crucial for developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect public health from the escalating impacts of climate change, necessitating interdisciplinary research and collaborative global action.
