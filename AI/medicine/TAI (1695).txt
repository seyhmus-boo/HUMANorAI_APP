While the direct application of quantum mechanics to antibiotic resistance remains limited, a theoretical framework can be developed considering the underlying molecular interactions.  Antibiotic efficacy hinges on specific binding affinities between the antibiotic and its target, often a bacterial enzyme.  Quantum mechanical calculations, particularly density functional theory (DFT), can model the electronic structure and intermolecular forces involved in these interactions. Resistance mechanisms, like mutations in the target enzyme's active site, alter the electronic distribution and thus the binding energy.  DFT could predict the impact of specific mutations on binding affinity, offering insights into the emergence of resistance.

Globally, the implications are significant.  Understanding the quantum mechanical basis of drug-target interactions facilitates the rational design of novel antibiotics with improved binding affinities less susceptible to resistance mutations.  Moreover, computational screening of vast chemical libraries, aided by quantum chemical calculations, can accelerate the discovery of new antibiotics.  However, the high computational cost associated with these calculations remains a challenge.  Further development of efficient quantum algorithms and improved hardware could revolutionize our understanding and combat against this critical global health threat.
