Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice. While advancements have primarily focused on instrumentation and imaging, a deeper understanding of the underlying physics governing tissue interaction at the microscopic level remains crucial for further optimization. This paper explores the evolution of surgical techniques in MIS through a quantum mechanical lens, examining how advancements subtly, yet profoundly, engage with principles of quantum mechanics.  We argue that the seemingly macroscopic world of surgical tools and procedures is fundamentally underpinned by quantum mechanical interactions at the molecular scale.  The precise cutting action of lasers, for instance, is contingent on quantum electrodynamics governing photon-matter interactions, influencing the precision and control afforded by laser scalpel technology.  Furthermore, the development of novel biomaterials and improved imaging modalities, such as enhanced optical coherence tomography, leverage principles of quantum mechanics in their design and functionality. By examining these interplays, we aim to provide a fresh perspective on the evolution of MIS, highlighting the inherent quantum mechanical basis of seemingly classical surgical techniques and identifying potential avenues for future innovation in this rapidly evolving field.  This research proposes that a quantum-informed approach can lead to more precise, efficient, and less invasive surgical procedures.
