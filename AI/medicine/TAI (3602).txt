The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Early research, primarily focused on cytogenetic analysis and the identification of chromosomal abnormalities like the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia, laid the foundation.  However, the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies dramatically accelerated progress, allowing for the comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes. This revealed the complex interplay of driver mutations, passenger mutations, and epigenetic alterations contributing to carcinogenesis.  Specific gene mutations, such as those in *BRCA1/2*, *EGFR*, and *KRAS*, have been linked to increased cancer risk and are now routinely screened for in clinical settings.  This genomic information enables the selection of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for EGFR-mutated lung cancers, maximizing efficacy while minimizing side effects compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies. Furthermore, the identification of biomarkers through genomic analysis predicts patient response to specific treatments, facilitating the tailoring of therapeutic strategies and improving overall outcomes.  This personalized approach, while still evolving, represents a significant advancement in cancer treatment, shifting from a one-size-fits-all approach towards individualized, precision-based interventions.
