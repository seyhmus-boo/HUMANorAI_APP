Vaccination remains a cornerstone of public health, demonstrably preventing millions of deaths annually and mitigating the societal burden of infectious diseases. This presentation will review the crucial role of vaccination in controlling and eradicating previously prevalent diseases, such as smallpox and polio, highlighting its impact on morbidity and mortality rates. We will then delve into recent advancements in vaccine technology, specifically focusing on mRNA vaccines and their application beyond COVID-19.  The rapid development and deployment of mRNA vaccines showcased their potential for addressing emerging infectious diseases and adapting to evolving pathogens.  Furthermore, we will explore novel vaccine platforms such as viral vector vaccines and the ongoing research into next-generation approaches, including personalized vaccines and mucosal vaccines offering enhanced efficacy and broader protection.  The presentation will also address challenges related to vaccine hesitancy and inequitable vaccine distribution, emphasizing the importance of public health initiatives to promote vaccine uptake globally.  Finally, we will discuss the future outlook for vaccination in maintaining global health security and preventing future outbreaks.
