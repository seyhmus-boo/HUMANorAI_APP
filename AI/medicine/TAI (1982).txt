Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health. This presentation explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human health outcomes.  We will examine the direct impacts of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, on morbidity and mortality, highlighting regional variations in vulnerability and resilience.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze indirect consequences, including the altered distribution of vector-borne diseases, the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to air pollution, and the impact on food security and nutritional status.  Existing literature demonstrates a clear correlation between rising temperatures and increased incidence of heatstroke, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory infections.  Changes in precipitation patterns also influence the spread of infectious diseases like malaria and dengue fever.  We will discuss the limitations of current surveillance systems in capturing the full extent of climate change-related health impacts and propose strategies for strengthening public health infrastructure to mitigate these risks.  Finally, the presentation will emphasize the urgent need for integrated, multi-sectoral approaches to address the climate-health nexus, emphasizing both adaptation and mitigation strategies for improved population health outcomes.
