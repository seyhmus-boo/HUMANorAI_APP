Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges in leveraging the genetic basis of cancer for personalized medicine.  While genomic sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of cancer's heterogeneity, translating this knowledge into effective, personalized therapies remains fraught with difficulties.

One major challenge lies in identifying truly driver mutations amongst the plethora of passenger mutations observed in tumour genomes.  Distinguishing causative alterations from incidental changes requires sophisticated bioinformatic analyses and robust validation through functional assays, often hampered by the complexity of tumour microenvironments and the lack of suitable in vitro and in vivo models.  Furthermore, the dynamic nature of cancer genomes, with intratumoral heterogeneity and the emergence of drug resistance, presents a significant hurdle.  Developing predictive models that accurately capture this evolution remains a critical unmet need.  Finally, the translation of genomic findings into clinically actionable therapies faces economic and logistical barriers, particularly regarding the accessibility of advanced sequencing technologies and targeted therapies in resource-limited settings.  Overcoming these challenges is crucial for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer medicine.
