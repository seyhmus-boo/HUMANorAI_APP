Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's capacity to treat bacterial infections.  This presentation will examine the multifaceted nature of this crisis, highlighting recent developments and their profound implications.  The rise of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly in healthcare settings, is driving increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs worldwide.  Recent studies underscore the contribution of various factors, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal health, inadequate infection control practices, and the limitations of current antibiotic development pipelines.

We will discuss the latest advancements in combating AR, including innovative diagnostic tools for rapid detection of resistant strains, the exploration of novel antibiotic targets and alternative therapies such as phage therapy and antimicrobial peptides.  Furthermore, the critical role of stewardship programs, promoting responsible antibiotic use, and strengthening global surveillance systems will be addressed.  Finally, the presentation will emphasize the urgent need for coordinated international action, involving policymakers, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the public, to mitigate the escalating threat of AR and ensure the continued effectiveness of antibiotics.
