Climate change significantly impacts public health, necessitating an interdisciplinary approach for effective understanding and mitigation.  The relationship is multifaceted, extending beyond direct impacts like heatstroke and extreme weather events.  Infectious disease epidemiology intersects with climatology, as altered temperature and precipitation patterns influence vector-borne disease transmission (e.g., malaria, Zika).  Changes in air quality, influenced by both climate change and pollution, are studied by atmospheric scientists and respiratory health specialists to assess their combined effect on respiratory illnesses like asthma.  Furthermore, food security, a subject of agricultural science and economics, is profoundly threatened by climate variability, leading to malnutrition and related health issues.  Mental health professionals are increasingly recognizing the psychological impacts of climate-related disasters and environmental degradation, highlighting the interconnectedness of climate change with societal well-being.  Thus, a truly comprehensive understanding requires collaboration across disciplines, integrating knowledge from environmental sciences, public health, social sciences, and economics to develop effective strategies for adaptation and mitigation.
