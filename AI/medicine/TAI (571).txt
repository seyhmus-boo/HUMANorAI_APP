Climate change significantly impacts public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.  The relationship is multifaceted, extending beyond direct impacts like heatstroke and extreme weather events.  Increased frequency and intensity of these events lead to injuries, fatalities, and displacement, straining healthcare systems and exacerbating existing health inequalities.  Furthermore, alterations in vector ecology, driven by shifting temperatures and rainfall patterns, expand the geographical range of infectious diseases like malaria and dengue fever, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.

Changes in air quality, including increased ground-level ozone and particulate matter from wildfires exacerbated by climate change, contribute to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  Food security is compromised by altered agricultural yields and disrupted supply chains, leading to malnutrition and undernutrition, particularly in developing countries.  Mental health is also significantly affected through trauma related to extreme weather events, displacement, and the psychological burden of living with climate-related anxieties.  Addressing this complex interplay necessitates collaboration between climatologists, epidemiologists, public health officials, economists, social scientists, and policymakers, highlighting the inherent interdisciplinary nature of this pressing global challenge.
