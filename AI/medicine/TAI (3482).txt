Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, with increasing prevalence rates observed globally across various diagnoses including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  This necessitates an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and addressing this complex issue.  Trends reveal a growing impact of societal factors such as social media usage, academic pressure, and socioeconomic disparities on mental well-being. Effective treatment necessitates integration of biological, psychological, and social perspectives.  Biological interventions, including pharmacotherapy, target neurochemical imbalances. Psychological therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), address maladaptive thoughts and behaviors.  Social interventions focus on family-based therapy, peer support groups, and school-based initiatives to improve social support networks and reduce stigma.  Furthermore, successful interventions often require collaboration between psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, educators, and family members, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary teamwork in optimizing adolescent mental healthcare. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies examining the interplay of risk and protective factors, as well as the development and implementation of cost-effective, accessible, and culturally sensitive interventions.
