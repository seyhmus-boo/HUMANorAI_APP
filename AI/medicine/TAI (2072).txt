Cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease, necessitating a personalized approach to treatment.  While advancements in genomic sequencing have unveiled a wealth of somatic mutations driving tumorigenesis, translating this knowledge into effective personalized medicine remains challenging. This presentation will explore key experimental hurdles in realizing the full potential of cancer genomics. We will discuss the complexities of identifying driver mutations amidst passenger mutations, emphasizing the difficulties in distinguishing clinically relevant alterations from inconsequential variations.  Furthermore,  the limitations of current *in vitro* and *in vivo* models in accurately recapitulating the tumour microenvironment and inter-tumoral heterogeneity will be addressed.  We will also examine the challenges associated with functional validation of candidate therapeutic targets identified through genomic analysis, including the difficulties in predicting drug response and overcoming inherent drug resistance mechanisms.  Finally, the ethical and logistical challenges of implementing large-scale genomic screening and personalized treatment strategies will be briefly highlighted, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts to overcome these obstacles and pave the way for truly effective personalized cancer therapies.
