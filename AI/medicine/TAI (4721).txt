Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges inherent in combating antibiotic resistance, a phenomenon with profound global implications.  The escalating prevalence of resistant strains necessitates urgent action, but research faces significant hurdles.  Firstly, identifying novel antibiotic targets remains a challenge.  Bacteria rapidly evolve resistance mechanisms, rendering existing antibiotics ineffective.  Secondly, developing new antibiotics is a costly and time-consuming process, with a low success rate due to the complexities of bacterial physiology and the need for both efficacy and minimal toxicity.  Thirdly,  in vivo studies are complicated by the multifaceted nature of infection, requiring sophisticated models that accurately mimic the complex interplay between the host immune system and the bacterial pathogen.  Furthermore,  understanding and predicting the evolution of resistance in diverse bacterial populations across varied environments poses a considerable computational and experimental challenge.  Ultimately, overcoming these experimental obstacles is crucial to developing effective strategies for mitigating the global threat of antibiotic resistance.
