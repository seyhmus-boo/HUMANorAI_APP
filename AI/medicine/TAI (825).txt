The genetic basis of cancer is increasingly understood, fueling the development of personalized medicine approaches.  However, translating this understanding into effective clinical practice remains fraught with experimental challenges. This presentation will explore key obstacles hindering progress in personalized cancer therapy.  We will discuss the difficulties in identifying actionable driver mutations within the complex landscape of somatic alterations observed in individual tumors, highlighting the limitations of current sequencing technologies and bioinformatic analysis in discerning clinically relevant mutations from passenger mutations.  Furthermore, the challenge of accurately predicting treatment response based on genomic profiling will be addressed, emphasizing the limitations of in vitro and in vivo model systems in replicating the complex tumor microenvironment. The development of robust, cost-effective assays for detecting circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and minimal residual disease (MRD), critical for monitoring treatment response and detecting relapse, will also be discussed, highlighting their current sensitivity and specificity limitations.  Finally, the ethical implications of personalized medicine, including issues of access and equity, will be briefly considered. This presentation aims to critically appraise the current state of the field and propose future research directions to overcome these significant experimental hurdles.
