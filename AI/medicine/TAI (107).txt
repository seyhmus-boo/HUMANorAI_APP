Minimally invasive surgical techniques have undergone a dramatic evolution, transitioning from rudimentary laparoscopic approaches to sophisticated robotic and image-guided procedures.  This review summarizes key advancements. Early laparoscopic surgery, limited by two-dimensional visualization and instrument dexterity, has been significantly enhanced by robotic platforms offering improved precision, articulation, and three-dimensional vision.  Concurrent developments in imaging technologies, including high-definition endoscopy and fluorescence-guided surgery, have further improved targeting and real-time tissue assessment.  Single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) represent ongoing efforts to minimize invasiveness, although challenges remain regarding instrument manipulation and access.  The integration of augmented reality and artificial intelligence promises to further revolutionize minimally invasive surgery by providing surgeons with enhanced situational awareness and predictive analytics. While benefits include reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes, challenges remain in addressing technical limitations, training requirements, and cost-effectiveness.  Future research should focus on refining existing techniques and exploring innovative approaches to optimize patient safety and surgical outcomes.
