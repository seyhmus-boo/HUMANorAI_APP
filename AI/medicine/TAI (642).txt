Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), initially pioneered with laparoscopy, has undergone a dramatic evolution driven by technological advancements and a focus on enhanced patient outcomes. Early laparoscopic techniques, relying on rigid instrumentation and 2D visualisation, were limited in dexterity and precision.  However, the introduction of robotic surgery, with its articulated instruments and 3D high-definition vision, significantly improved surgical accuracy and control.  Recent developments have focused on further miniaturization, with natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) exploring access via natural orifices, minimizing external incisions.

Beyond robotic systems, advancements in imaging technologies, such as augmented reality and fluorescence-guided surgery, provide surgeons with real-time, enhanced anatomical visualization, facilitating more precise targeting and reducing collateral damage.  Single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) further refines the minimally invasive approach, reducing scarring and accelerating recovery.  These ongoing refinements in instrumentation, imaging, and surgical approaches collectively promise even less invasive procedures, ultimately improving patient safety and quality of life.
