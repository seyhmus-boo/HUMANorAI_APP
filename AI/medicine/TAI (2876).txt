Recent advancements in understanding the genetic basis of cancer have significantly propelled the field of personalized medicine.  High-throughput sequencing technologies, including whole-genome and exome sequencing, have enabled the identification of numerous driver mutations and genomic alterations underpinning diverse cancer types. This has facilitated the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy, tailored to specific genetic profiles.  Furthermore, the integration of genomic data with clinical information through large-scale collaborative projects, like The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), has improved our understanding of cancer heterogeneity and unveiled novel therapeutic targets.  Liquid biopsies, analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), offer minimally invasive approaches for monitoring disease progression and treatment response, enabling real-time adjustments to personalized treatment strategies.  However, challenges remain, including the complexity of interpreting genomic data, the high cost of sequencing and personalized therapies, and the need for robust clinical trials to validate the efficacy of these approaches across diverse patient populations. Despite these hurdles, the genetic basis of cancer continues to be a powerful driver of innovation in personalized oncology, paving the way for more effective and precise cancer treatments.
