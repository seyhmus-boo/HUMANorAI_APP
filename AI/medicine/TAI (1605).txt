Antibiotic resistance, the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of antibiotics, represents a significant global health threat with deep historical roots.  The widespread use of antibiotics following their discovery in the mid-20th century initiated a selective pressure, favoring the survival and propagation of resistant strains. This process, driven by natural selection, has led to the emergence and dissemination of resistance mechanisms, including enzymatic inactivation, target modification, and efflux pumps.

The global implications are profound.  The effectiveness of antibiotics in treating bacterial infections is diminishing, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  Treatment of resistant infections necessitates the use of alternative, often more toxic, therapies, prolonging hospital stays and increasing the risk of complications.  The impact extends beyond human health, affecting animal agriculture and food security due to the use of antibiotics in livestock.  Furthermore, the lack of novel antibiotic development exacerbates the problem, leaving humanity increasingly vulnerable to untreatable bacterial infections.  Addressing this crisis requires a multifaceted approach, including improved stewardship of existing antibiotics, investment in research and development of new therapies, and public health interventions focused on infection prevention and control.
