The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical global challenge.  Historically, while the impacts of climate on disease were observed – such as cholera outbreaks linked to water contamination exacerbated by extreme weather – the direct attribution to anthropogenic climate change remained underdeveloped until recently.  Early public health responses focused on immediate mitigation of disease outbreaks, lacking the broader climate change perspective.

Now, the scientific consensus establishes a multifaceted connection. Rising temperatures increase the geographical range and intensity of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever.  Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, directly cause injuries, fatalities, and displace populations, creating vulnerabilities to infectious diseases and mental health issues.  Changes in precipitation patterns affect water quality and food security, impacting malnutrition and diarrheal diseases.  Air pollution, exacerbated by climate change, contributes to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular diseases.

Furthermore, the indirect consequences of climate change, such as mass migration and conflict over resources, contribute to further public health vulnerabilities.  Effectively addressing these intertwined challenges necessitates integrated strategies that combine climate change mitigation, adaptation, and robust public health interventions, including strengthening surveillance systems, enhancing healthcare infrastructure, and promoting climate-resilient development.
