Mental health disorders in adolescents are a growing global concern, impacting academic achievement, social functioning, and long-term well-being. This presentation will examine recent trends in the prevalence and presentation of common adolescent mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  We will analyze data highlighting geographical variations and socio-demographic factors influencing risk, drawing on epidemiological studies and national surveys.  Further, the presentation will critically evaluate current treatment approaches, focusing on the efficacy and limitations of pharmacological interventions, psychotherapies (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy), and integrated care models.  The evolving role of digital mental health technologies in access and delivery of care will also be discussed.  Finally, we will explore future research directions, emphasizing the need for early intervention strategies, culturally sensitive approaches, and the development of more personalized treatment plans to effectively address the complex needs of this vulnerable population.  The overall aim is to provide an updated overview for clinicians, researchers, and policymakers striving to improve adolescent mental healthcare.
