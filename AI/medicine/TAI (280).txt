Adolescents experience a high prevalence of mental health disorders (MHDs), with significant implications for their development and future well-being.  Recent trends reveal increasing rates of anxiety and depression, particularly among girls, alongside rising concerns regarding self-harm and suicide.  This necessitates an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and addressing these complex issues.  Effective treatment requires collaboration between psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, educators, and primary care physicians.  While pharmacological interventions play a role, particularly in severe cases, evidence supports the efficacy of evidence-based psychotherapies, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), often delivered in integrated care models.  Furthermore, addressing systemic factors such as socioeconomic inequalities, family dynamics, and school environments is crucial.  Future research should focus on early identification and preventative strategies, incorporating longitudinal studies to elucidate the interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to MHD development.  An interdisciplinary approach, leveraging the expertise of various professionals and implementing holistic interventions, is essential to improve adolescent mental health outcomes.
