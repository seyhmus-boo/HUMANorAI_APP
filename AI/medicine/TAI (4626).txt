Antibiotic resistance (AR) presents a significant and escalating global health crisis.  This review summarizes the multifaceted problem and its far-reaching implications.  The widespread overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate infection control practices, have driven the selection and proliferation of resistant pathogens.  Consequently, common infections are becoming increasingly difficult, and often impossible, to treat, leading to prolonged illness, increased mortality, and substantial healthcare costs.

The global implications extend beyond healthcare, impacting food security through limitations on livestock production and potentially jeopardizing numerous medical procedures reliant on effective antibiotics.  Practical applications focusing on mitigation strategies are urgently needed.  These include optimizing antibiotic stewardship programs, promoting hygiene and sanitation, developing rapid diagnostic tools for accurate treatment, investing in research for novel antibiotics and alternative therapies (such as phage therapy and antimicrobial peptides), and strengthening global surveillance systems to track resistance patterns.  Ultimately, a multi-sectoral, coordinated approach involving governments, healthcare professionals, and the pharmaceutical industry is crucial to combat this burgeoning threat to global health and well-being.  Failure to act decisively will result in a return to a pre-antibiotic era with devastating consequences.
