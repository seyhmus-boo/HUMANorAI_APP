Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly antibiotic resistance, poses a significant and escalating threat to global health security.  The widespread use and misuse of antibiotics have driven the selection and proliferation of resistant bacterial strains, rendering previously effective treatments ineffective. This phenomenon transcends geographical boundaries, impacting healthcare systems worldwide and threatening progress in various fields, including surgery, organ transplantation, and cancer treatment. This research paper examines the multifaceted global implications of antibiotic resistance, focusing on the epidemiological trends driving the emergence and dissemination of resistant pathogens. We analyze the complex interplay between factors contributing to the problem, encompassing human, animal, and environmental reservoirs of resistant bacteria, as well as the influence of healthcare practices, agricultural policies, and socioeconomic disparities. The paper further explores the economic burden imposed by AMR, including increased healthcare costs, prolonged hospital stays, and reduced productivity. Finally, we discuss current strategies to combat antibiotic resistance, including surveillance, stewardship programs, the development of novel antimicrobials, and the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. The aim is to highlight the urgency of concerted global action to mitigate this growing crisis and safeguard public health.
