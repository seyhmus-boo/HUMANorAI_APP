Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Furthermore, altered climate patterns exacerbate the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, expanding their geographical range and transmission seasons.  Recent research highlights the complex interplay between climate change and air quality, with increased frequency and intensity of wildfires leading to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular problems.  Changes in precipitation patterns can contaminate water sources, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases.  Food insecurity, stemming from disrupted agricultural yields, contributes to malnutrition and associated health consequences.  

Beyond these direct impacts, climate change exacerbates existing health inequalities.  Marginalized communities often bear the brunt of climate-related health risks due to limited access to resources and healthcare.  Recent developments in climate change epidemiology are focusing on sophisticated modelling techniques to predict future health burdens and inform effective adaptation strategies.  These efforts underscore the urgent need for integrated approaches that address both climate mitigation and public health resilience to safeguard global well-being.
