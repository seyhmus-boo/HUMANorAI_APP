The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical global challenge.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly impacting vulnerable populations.  Recent studies highlight escalating morbidity and mortality rates during extreme heat events, exceeding previously projected impacts.  Furthermore, alterations in precipitation patterns exacerbate the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, with expanding geographical ranges observed in recent decades.  Changes in air quality, driven by both increased wildfires and altered pollutant dispersion patterns, pose a significant respiratory health burden.  Indirect effects include food insecurity from disrupted agricultural yields and displacement due to sea-level rise and extreme weather, impacting mental health and increasing the risk of infectious disease outbreaks in overcrowded settlements.  Recent research emphasizes the synergistic effects of these multiple stressors, necessitating integrated approaches to mitigation and adaptation that prioritize public health preparedness and resilience.  The urgency of addressing this intertwined crisis cannot be overstated.
