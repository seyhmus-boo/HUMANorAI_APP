Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  The rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens necessitates a shift from solely biomedical perspectives to encompass ecological, social, and economic factors.  Agricultural practices, including the widespread use of antibiotics in livestock, contribute substantially to the dissemination of resistance genes into the environment, impacting human health through the food chain and contamination of water sources.  Socioeconomic disparities influence access to effective antibiotics and infection control measures, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.  Furthermore, the global trade of food and people facilitates the rapid spread of resistant strains across geographical boundaries, requiring international collaboration for effective surveillance and control.  Interdisciplinary research integrating microbiology, epidemiology, environmental science, social sciences, and economics is crucial to understand the complex interplay of factors driving AR.  Developing innovative strategies, including alternative therapies, improved diagnostics, and targeted interventions, requires coordinated efforts across these disciplines to address this escalating global health crisis.  Ultimately, a One Health approach, recognizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, is paramount to combatting AR effectively.
