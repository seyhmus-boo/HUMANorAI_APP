Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health.  The relationship is bidirectional, with climate change exacerbating existing health issues and generating novel ones.  Rising temperatures directly increase heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly impacting vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, expanding their geographic range and transmission seasons.  Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, cause injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences from trauma and loss.  Furthermore, alterations in air quality, stemming from wildfires and increased ground-level ozone, exacerbate respiratory illnesses.

Recent developments highlight the increasing urgency of this issue.  Studies increasingly demonstrate the synergistic effects of climate change on multiple health outcomes, for example, the combined impact of heat waves and air pollution on cardiovascular health.  Advances in spatial epidemiology and modelling techniques are improving our ability to predict and map climate-sensitive health risks, aiding targeted interventions.  However, translating scientific findings into effective public health policy and resource allocation remains a major challenge, requiring interdisciplinary collaboration and global cooperation.
