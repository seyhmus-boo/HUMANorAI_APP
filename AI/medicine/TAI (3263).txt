Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health.  This lecture explores the intricate relationship between a changing climate and its impact on human well-being. Rising global temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst vulnerable populations.  Furthermore, altered weather patterns exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases through shifts in vector habitats and increased rainfall intensity.  Changes in air quality, stemming from intensified wildfires and pollution, lead to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular problems.  Indirect effects include food insecurity, displacement due to extreme weather events, and mental health challenges associated with loss and trauma.  Addressing climate change is therefore not merely an environmental imperative, but a crucial public health strategy demanding immediate and comprehensive action, encompassing mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation strategies to build community resilience and protect vulnerable groups. This necessitates interdisciplinary collaboration and robust public health infrastructure.
