Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has profoundly reshaped modern healthcare delivery.  Its impact stems from its ability to overcome geographical barriers and enhance accessibility, particularly for patients in underserved rural areas or with mobility limitations.  Practical applications are diverse and rapidly expanding.  Remote patient monitoring (RPM) utilizes wearable sensors and connected devices to track vital signs, enabling proactive intervention and improved chronic disease management.  Teleconsultations, encompassing video conferencing and secure messaging, facilitate virtual consultations between patients and healthcare providers, offering convenient access to specialist opinions and reducing hospital visits.  Furthermore, teleradiology enables the remote interpretation of medical images, accelerating diagnosis and treatment, while telehealth education empowers patients with self-management skills.  Despite its benefits, challenges remain, including concerns around data security, regulatory frameworks, reimbursement models, and the digital literacy gap among certain patient populations.  Overcoming these obstacles is crucial for maximizing telemedicine's potential to improve healthcare outcomes and equity.
