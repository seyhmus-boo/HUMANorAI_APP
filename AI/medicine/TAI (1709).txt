Cancer's genetic basis underpins the burgeoning field of personalized medicine.  Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized our understanding, revealing the complex interplay of somatic mutations, germline predispositions, and epigenetic alterations driving tumorigenesis.  Identifying driver mutations, those directly contributing to cancer development, is crucial.  This allows for targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors against specific oncogenic mutations in lung cancer.

Recent developments encompass improved bioinformatics tools for analyzing NGS data, enabling the identification of rare and subtle genomic variations.  Liquid biopsies, analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), offer minimally invasive monitoring of disease progression and response to treatment, improving early detection and facilitating real-time adjustments to therapy. Furthermore, research into immunotherapy harnesses the body's immune system by identifying neoantigens, unique tumor-specific mutations, for targeted attack. These advances, while still evolving, promise a future where cancer treatment is tailored to an individual's unique genetic profile, maximizing efficacy and minimizing adverse effects.
