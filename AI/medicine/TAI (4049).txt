Climate change poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health.  This presentation explores the complex and multifaceted relationship between a changing climate and human health outcomes, drawing on historical context and contemporary research.  Historically, climate variability has always influenced disease patterns, with periods of drought and flood correlating with outbreaks of infectious diseases like cholera and malaria.  However, the accelerated pace of anthropogenic climate change intensifies these established risks and introduces novel challenges.  We will examine the direct impacts, such as increased heat-related mortality and morbidity, the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to worsening air quality, and the expansion of vector-borne diseases into new geographical areas.  Furthermore, the indirect consequences, including malnutrition from disrupted agricultural systems, mental health impacts from displacement and trauma linked to extreme weather events, and increased risks of waterborne diseases, will be discussed.  Finally, the presentation will briefly address the challenges and opportunities for building climate-resilient health systems, emphasizing the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on population health and well-being.
