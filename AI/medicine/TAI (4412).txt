Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution, driven by advancements across multiple disciplines.  Early laparoscopic procedures, initially limited in scope, have blossomed into sophisticated techniques facilitated by innovations in optics, instrumentation, and imaging.  The development of robotics, drawing upon engineering and computer science, has significantly enhanced precision and dexterity, expanding the range of feasible procedures.  Interdisciplinary collaboration with materials science has yielded biocompatible polymers and improved suture materials, minimizing trauma and improving patient outcomes.  Furthermore, advancements in anesthesia and pain management, alongside contributions from biomedical engineering in creating advanced monitoring systems, have collectively improved patient safety and recovery times.  The integration of data science and artificial intelligence promises further refinements in surgical planning and intraoperative decision-making.  However, the continued evolution of MIS necessitates ongoing interdisciplinary efforts to address challenges such as training, cost-effectiveness, and equitable access to these advanced techniques globally. The future of MIS hinges on synergistic collaboration across these diverse fields.
