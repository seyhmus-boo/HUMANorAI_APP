Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, with implications far-reaching beyond individual patient outcomes.  This review summarizes the critical aspects of this complex issue.  The widespread overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine have driven the selection and proliferation of resistant bacteria, compromising the efficacy of existing treatments for a broad range of infections.  Consequently, infections once easily treatable are becoming increasingly difficult and costly to manage, resulting in prolonged hospital stays, higher mortality rates, and substantial economic burdens on healthcare systems worldwide.  The global implications extend to food security, impacting livestock production and the safety of the food supply chain.

Practical applications aimed at mitigating AR include the development and implementation of robust infection prevention and control measures, optimizing antibiotic prescribing practices through stewardship programs, and accelerating the discovery and development of novel antimicrobials, including alternative therapeutic strategies such as bacteriophages and immunotherapies.  Furthermore, strengthening surveillance systems to track resistance patterns is crucial for informed decision-making.  Addressing AR requires a multi-faceted, global collaborative effort involving governments, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, and the public, emphasizing responsible antibiotic use and investment in innovative solutions.  Failure to do so threatens to reverse decades of progress in infectious disease control.
