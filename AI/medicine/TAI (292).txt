Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This abstract explores the complex relationship between a changing climate and its impacts on human health, highlighting key pathways of influence.  Rising temperatures are directly linked to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns exacerbate the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, while altered weather patterns increase the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, leading to injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences.  Furthermore, climate change impacts food security and water resources, contributing to malnutrition and waterborne diseases.  Indirect effects include increased air pollution and the exacerbation of existing health inequalities.  Quantifying the precise health burden of climate change remains challenging, necessitating the development of robust surveillance systems and predictive models.  Effective mitigation and adaptation strategies, including investments in public health infrastructure and climate-resilient healthcare systems, are crucial to minimizing the adverse health impacts of climate change and ensuring global health equity.  Future research should prioritize the integration of climate and health data to inform evidence-based policy interventions.
