The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Early research, focusing on identifying oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes like *RAS* and *TP53*, laid the groundwork.  These discoveries established a link between specific genetic alterations and cancer development, moving beyond solely epidemiological and histological classifications.  However, the complexity of cancer—its heterogeneity and the interplay of multiple genetic and epigenetic factors—highlighted limitations in this initial understanding.

Advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), have significantly broadened our knowledge.  NGS enables comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, revealing diverse mutations, copy number variations, and fusion genes driving individual cancers. This information informs targeted therapies, matching specific genetic aberrations with drugs designed to inhibit their activity.  Examples include EGFR inhibitors for EGFR-mutated lung cancers and BRAF inhibitors for BRAF-mutated melanomas.

Despite progress, challenges remain.  Tumor heterogeneity presents difficulties in identifying the most clinically relevant mutations, and the development of resistance to targeted therapies remains a significant hurdle.  Furthermore, ethical considerations surrounding access to and affordability of personalized cancer treatments require careful consideration.  Nevertheless, the ongoing integration of genomic data with clinical information promises further advancements in cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.
