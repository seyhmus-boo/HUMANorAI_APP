Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health globally.  Rising temperatures exacerbate existing health challenges, including cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses through increased heat stress and air pollution.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to waterborne diseases and vector-borne illnesses such as malaria and dengue fever, with altered geographical distributions and increased transmission seasons observed.  Extreme weather events, increasingly frequent and intense due to climate change, result in direct mortality from trauma and drowning, alongside indirect impacts such as displacement, food insecurity, and mental health consequences.  Furthermore, climate change impacts agricultural yields and food security, leading to malnutrition and associated health problems.  The effects are not evenly distributed, with vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and low-income communities, disproportionately affected due to limited access to healthcare and resources.  Addressing the health consequences of climate change requires a comprehensive approach encompassing mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation strategies to build resilience and protect public health infrastructure.  Further research is crucial to fully elucidate the complex interactions between climate change and health outcomes, facilitating the development of effective and targeted interventions.
