The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Early research, focusing on identifying single mutated genes like *RAS* and *TP53*, established a link between specific genetic alterations and increased cancer risk.  However, the advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), has dramatically expanded our knowledge.  NGS allows for the comprehensive profiling of a tumor's genome, transcriptome, and epigenome, revealing a complex landscape of somatic mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic modifications driving tumorigenesis. This detailed molecular characterization has led to the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for specific oncogenic mutations in lung cancer, and immune checkpoint inhibitors that leverage the patient's immune system against tumor-specific neoantigens. While early successes demonstrate the promise of personalized medicine, challenges remain.  Identifying predictive biomarkers to ensure optimal patient selection for targeted therapies and managing the emergence of drug resistance due to further genetic alterations are critical areas of ongoing research.  Furthermore, the ethical implications of utilizing extensive genetic information for individualized treatment must be carefully considered.
