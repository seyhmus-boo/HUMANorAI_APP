Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, driven by continuous evolution in techniques and technology.  Early MIS relied primarily on rigid endoscopes and limited instrumentation, restricting access and dexterity.  Subsequent advancements introduced flexible endoscopes, offering improved visualization in complex anatomical spaces.  The development and refinement of robotic-assisted surgery, with its enhanced precision, dexterity, and three-dimensional visualization, represents a significant leap forward, particularly in intricate procedures like cardiac and urological surgeries.  Concurrent progress in energy sources (e.g., ultrasonic, bipolar), suture techniques (e.g., knotless sutures), and imaging modalities (e.g., fluorescence-guided surgery) has further minimized invasiveness and improved outcomes. These innovations have resulted in smaller incisions, reduced trauma, less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and faster patient recovery.  Practical applications span numerous surgical specialties, including general surgery, gynecology, cardiothoracic surgery, and neurosurgery, leading to improved patient safety and quality of life.  Further research focuses on optimizing surgical workflows, integrating artificial intelligence, and developing novel instruments to further refine MIS techniques and expand their applicability.
