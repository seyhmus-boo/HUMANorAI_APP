Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health.  This presentation explores the intricate relationship between a changing climate and the resultant impacts on human well-being. Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns exacerbate the risk of waterborne diseases and vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever, through alterations in pathogen life cycles and vector habitats.  Furthermore, extreme weather events, such as hurricanes and floods, cause immediate injuries and fatalities, and disrupt healthcare infrastructure, leading to long-term health consequences.  Indirect impacts include malnutrition stemming from agricultural disruption and displacement due to sea-level rise and extreme weather, which contribute to mental health challenges and social instability.  Addressing climate change is therefore crucial not only for environmental sustainability but also for safeguarding global public health and ensuring equitable access to healthcare.  Mitigation and adaptation strategies are essential to mitigate the projected health burdens associated with climate change.
