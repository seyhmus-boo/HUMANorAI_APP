Antibiotic resistance (AR), a global health crisis, necessitates an interdisciplinary approach encompassing microbiology, medicine, public health, environmental science, and social sciences.  The overuse and misuse of antibiotics, driven by both clinical practice and agricultural applications, fuels the selection and spread of resistant microorganisms.  This evolutionary pressure necessitates understanding microbial genetics and the mechanisms of resistance development, including horizontal gene transfer and mutations, a key area of microbiological research.  

Effective public health interventions require epidemiological surveillance, stringent infection control protocols, and antibiotic stewardship programs, integrating medical and social sciences.  Environmental science plays a crucial role in identifying reservoirs of resistant bacteria in soil, water, and animals, emphasizing the interconnectedness of human and environmental health.  Furthermore, socioeconomic factors, including access to healthcare and sanitation, significantly influence AR prevalence, necessitating collaborative efforts between public health and social scientists for effective policy development and implementation.  Addressing AR globally requires a holistic, interdisciplinary strategy to mitigate its escalating impact on human and planetary health.
