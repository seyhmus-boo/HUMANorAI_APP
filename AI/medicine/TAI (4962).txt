Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, demanding urgent research to combat its escalating impact.  While extensive research explores novel therapeutic strategies, experimental challenges significantly hinder progress.  Developing robust in vitro models accurately reflecting in vivo conditions remains a major hurdle. Current models often fail to capture the complex interplay of bacterial populations, host immune responses, and the intricate nature of biofilm formation, crucial factors influencing AR development and dissemination.  Furthermore, translating findings from preclinical models to clinical trials presents significant challenges, with efficacy often not replicated in humans.  The heterogeneity of bacterial strains, variations in patient populations, and the influence of concomitant illnesses complicate the design and interpretation of clinical studies.  Additionally, the high cost and logistical complexities associated with large-scale clinical trials impede the rapid development and evaluation of novel antimicrobials.  Overcoming these experimental challenges necessitates a multidisciplinary approach involving advanced modelling techniques, improved preclinical models, and streamlined clinical trial designs, ultimately improving our understanding and ability to mitigate the escalating threat of AR.
