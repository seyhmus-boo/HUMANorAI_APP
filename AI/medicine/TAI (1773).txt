Organ transplantation, while a life-saving medical marvel, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  Central to these is the allocation of scarce organs, requiring fair and equitable distribution systems.  Utilitarian approaches prioritize maximizing the number of lives saved, often employing points-based systems considering factors such as medical urgency and life expectancy. However, this can disadvantage certain populations or individuals perceived as less likely to survive post-transplant.  

Deontological perspectives, conversely, emphasize the inherent right to life and the moral duty to respect individual autonomy.  This necessitates careful consideration of informed consent, ensuring potential donors understand the implications fully, and prohibiting coercion.  Furthermore, the potential for exploitation of vulnerable populations, such as prisoners or the economically disadvantaged, demands rigorous safeguards.  Practical applications necessitate transparent allocation policies, robust oversight committees, and ongoing public discourse to ensure ethical organ procurement and transplantation practices.
