Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field.  This review examines key dilemmas arising from the inherent scarcity of organs, focusing on three principal areas. Firstly, the allocation of organs necessitates careful scrutiny of justice and equity, balancing factors such as medical urgency, waiting time, and societal contribution.  Disparities in access based on socioeconomic status, race, and geography raise serious concerns regarding fairness and require ongoing reform of allocation algorithms. Secondly, the process of informed consent, particularly in situations involving incapacitated donors or families facing emotional distress, presents significant challenges.  Ensuring truly voluntary and informed decisions necessitates robust ethical guidelines and sensitive communication strategies. Thirdly, the commercialization of organs, though largely prohibited, continues to pose a significant threat to ethical principles.  Combating organ trafficking and exploitation requires international cooperation and the strengthening of legal frameworks.  Future research should prioritize the development of equitable allocation systems, enhancing informed consent practices, and bolstering global efforts to combat the illicit organ trade to ensure ethical and just organ transplantation for all.
