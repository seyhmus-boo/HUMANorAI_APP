Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, jeopardizing the effective treatment of bacterial infections.  The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, has driven the selection and proliferation of resistant strains. This phenomenon transcends geographical boundaries, with multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens circulating internationally via travel, trade, and environmental dissemination.  The consequences of AR are far-reaching, increasing morbidity and mortality rates, prolonging hospital stays, and escalating healthcare costs.  Infections once easily treatable are becoming increasingly difficult to manage, leading to a resurgence of previously controlled diseases and limiting treatment options for life-threatening conditions. The global impact extends beyond individual health outcomes, impacting economic productivity, food security (through livestock and agricultural implications), and national security.  Addressing this complex challenge necessitates a multi-faceted approach encompassing stewardship initiatives, improved infection control, accelerated research and development of novel antimicrobials and alternative therapies, and strengthened global surveillance systems to effectively monitor and respond to the evolving threat of AR.
