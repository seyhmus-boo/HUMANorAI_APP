The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine approaches.  Historically, cancer treatment relied on broad-spectrum therapies targeting rapidly dividing cells, often leading to significant side effects.  Early research, focusing on identifying chromosomal abnormalities and specific oncogenes like *src*, provided foundational knowledge.  However, the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies dramatically accelerated progress, enabling the detailed characterization of tumor genomes.  This revealed the remarkable heterogeneity within and between cancers, highlighting the complexity of driver mutations and the importance of considering the unique genetic profile of each tumor. Consequently, personalized medicine, utilizing genomic data to tailor treatment strategies, emerged as a paradigm shift.  NGS facilitates the identification of actionable mutations, informing targeted therapies like tyrosine kinase inhibitors or immunotherapy approaches.  Furthermore, the discovery of tumor mutational burden (TMB) and microsatellite instability (MSI) status has significantly improved the selection of patients likely to benefit from immune checkpoint inhibitors. While challenges remain, including cost and accessibility, the integration of genomic information into clinical practice represents a crucial step toward more effective and less toxic cancer treatments.
