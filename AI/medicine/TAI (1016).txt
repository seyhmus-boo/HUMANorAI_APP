Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, undermining modern medicine's capacity to treat bacterial infections.  This review summarizes the multifaceted implications of AR, highlighting its impact on healthcare systems and global economies.  The increasing prevalence of resistant strains necessitates a multifaceted approach, emphasizing both prudent antibiotic stewardship and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.  Practical applications of this understanding include the implementation of stricter infection control protocols in healthcare settings, promoting responsible antibiotic prescribing practices through education and guidelines, and investing in research and development of alternative antimicrobial agents, such as phage therapy and antimicrobial peptides.  Furthermore, diagnostic tools capable of rapidly identifying resistant strains are crucial for effective treatment decisions.  The economic burden of AR, encompassing increased healthcare costs and lost productivity, necessitates global collaboration and coordinated efforts to mitigate its impact.  Failure to address AR effectively will lead to a return to a pre-antibiotic era, with devastating consequences for global health and security.
