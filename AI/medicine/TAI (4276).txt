Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field.  This lecture addressed key challenges, focusing on three primary areas:  donor consent and autonomy, encompassing the ethical distinctions between deceased and living donation and the potential for coercion or undue influence.  Secondly, allocation justice was examined, scrutinizing existing systems prioritizing medical urgency and organ compatibility while acknowledging the inherent inequalities these criteria perpetuate.  Discussion encompassed the ethical implications of prioritizing certain patient groups over others and the challenges of balancing need with fairness.  Finally, the lecture explored the ethical dimensions of commercialization, including concerns about exploitation, particularly in developing nations, and the potential compromise of altruistic donation models.  In conclusion, the ethical landscape of organ transplantation necessitates a continuous reassessment of existing practices and a commitment to ensuring equitable and just allocation within a framework of robust informed consent and unwavering respect for human dignity.
