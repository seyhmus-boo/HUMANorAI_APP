Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, with disorders often misdiagnosed or attributed to typical teenage angst.  However, recent decades have witnessed a significant increase in the prevalence of conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders among adolescents.  Several factors contribute to this trend, including societal pressures, increased academic competition, social media influence, and evolving family structures.  These pressures can exacerbate pre-existing vulnerabilities or trigger new onset disorders.

Treatment approaches have also evolved significantly.  Historically, interventions were often limited and stigmatised.  Currently, evidence-based treatments are increasingly available, encompassing pharmacological interventions like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression, alongside various psychotherapeutic modalities. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and family-based therapy demonstrate efficacy in addressing various adolescent mental health challenges. Early intervention and integrated care models, emphasizing a holistic approach that considers biological, psychological, and social factors, are increasingly recognised as crucial for improving outcomes and mitigating long-term consequences.  Despite advancements, access to appropriate care remains a significant challenge, underscoring the need for continued research and policy reform.
