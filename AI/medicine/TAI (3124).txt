Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting crucial regulatory pathways governing cell growth and apoptosis.  Advances in genomics have significantly elucidated the genetic basis of diverse cancers, revealing specific driver mutations and their contributions to tumorigenesis.  This understanding has fueled the development of personalized medicine, enabling targeted therapies tailored to individual patient's tumor genetic profile.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows comprehensive genomic profiling, identifying actionable mutations in genes such as *EGFR*, *KRAS*, and *BRAF*, guiding selection of tyrosine kinase inhibitors or other targeted agents.  Furthermore, analysis of tumor mutational burden (TMB) informs immunotherapy efficacy predictions.  However, intratumor heterogeneity and the emergence of drug resistance pose significant challenges.  Ongoing research focuses on incorporating longitudinal genomic monitoring, exploring novel therapeutic targets, and developing predictive biomarkers to enhance treatment response and improve patient outcomes in personalized cancer care.  Integrating multi-omics data, including transcriptomics and proteomics, promises to further refine our understanding and optimize personalized therapeutic strategies.
