This presentation examines the evolving landscape of adolescent mental health disorders, focusing on emerging trends and the inherent challenges in developing and implementing effective treatments.  We will discuss the increasing prevalence of anxiety and depression, alongside the rising concern surrounding less-studied disorders like eating disorders and self-harm behaviors.  A key focus will be on the methodological challenges associated with researching this population, including ethical considerations surrounding vulnerable participants, difficulties in achieving accurate diagnoses, and the complexities of longitudinal studies tracing developmental trajectories.  Furthermore, the presentation will explore the limitations of existing treatment modalities, such as the efficacy of pharmacotherapy in adolescents and the barriers to accessing evidence-based psychotherapeutic interventions, particularly in under-resourced communities. We will highlight the need for innovative research designs, such as incorporating digital technologies and mixed-methods approaches, to overcome these experimental challenges and ultimately improve the mental health outcomes for adolescents.  The presentation will conclude by outlining promising avenues for future research in this critical area.
