Telemedicine has rapidly evolved, transforming modern healthcare delivery through increased accessibility and efficiency. Recent developments leverage advancements in technology, particularly high-speed internet and mobile applications, to facilitate remote consultations, monitoring, and diagnosis.  This abstract examines the expanding role of telemedicine in addressing healthcare disparities, particularly in underserved rural and remote populations, providing timely access to specialists and reducing geographical barriers.  Advances in telehealth platforms incorporate sophisticated features like remote patient monitoring (RPM) devices integrating with electronic health records (EHRs), enabling proactive management of chronic conditions and improved patient outcomes.  Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms within telemedicine platforms enhances diagnostic accuracy and predictive capabilities, potentially optimizing resource allocation and improving the efficiency of clinical workflows.  However, challenges persist, including concerns regarding data security, regulatory frameworks, and the digital literacy of both patients and providers. Future research should focus on addressing these limitations to fully realize telemedicine's transformative potential and ensure equitable access to high-quality healthcare for all.
