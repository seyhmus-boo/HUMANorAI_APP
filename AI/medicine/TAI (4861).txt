Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This paper explores the evolutionary trajectory of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in its remarkable progress.  Early MIS techniques, exemplified by laparoscopy, relied heavily on advancements in optics and instrumentation, demanding close cooperation between surgeons and engineers. However, the field has subsequently expanded dramatically, incorporating expertise from diverse fields to overcome persistent limitations.  This evolution encompasses not only advancements in imaging technologies, such as enhanced visualization and three-dimensional imaging, but also significant contributions from robotics, materials science (e.g., suture materials, biocompatible polymers), and data analytics for procedural optimization.  Furthermore,  the development of novel energy sources for tissue dissection and hemostasis, alongside advancements in anesthesia and pain management, underscore the inherently interdisciplinary nature of MIS innovation.  This paper will analyze these key interdisciplinary links, showcasing how their synergistic integration has propelled the sophistication and breadth of MIS techniques, ultimately improving patient outcomes and expanding the scope of surgical possibilities.
