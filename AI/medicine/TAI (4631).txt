Adolescents experience a disproportionately high burden of mental health disorders, with significant implications for their development and future well-being. This presentation examines emerging trends in the prevalence and presentation of common adolescent mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  We will analyze recent epidemiological data highlighting potential contributing factors such as increased social media usage, academic pressure, and socioeconomic disparities.  Furthermore, we will review the efficacy of current treatment modalities, emphasizing evidence-based approaches such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacology.  A particular focus will be given to the integration of technology-assisted interventions, including telehealth and mobile apps, to improve access to care and personalize treatment plans.  Finally, we will discuss practical applications for clinicians, educators, and parents in identifying early warning signs, fostering supportive environments, and facilitating appropriate referrals to specialized mental health services.  The presentation aims to equip attendees with actionable strategies for promoting adolescent mental health and wellbeing within their respective contexts.
