Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice.  However, a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physics governing the interaction between surgical instruments and biological tissues within the confined spaces of MIS remains elusive. This research explores the evolution of surgical techniques in MIS through a novel lens: quantum mechanics. While the macroscopic effects of surgical tools are well-documented, the microscopic interactions at the tissue-instrument interface are governed by quantum phenomena, influencing factors such as cutting efficiency, tissue damage, and healing. This paper argues that a deeper appreciation of quantum mechanical principles, particularly regarding molecular interactions and energy transfer during surgical maneuvers, is crucial for further advancements in MIS.  We will analyze how the development of new materials, laser technology, and robotic assistance, key drivers in MIS evolution, are implicitly reliant on quantum mechanical effects.  Specifically, we investigate the role of quantum electrodynamics in laser ablation, the quantum nature of material strength influencing instrument design, and the implications of quantum entanglement in advanced robotic control systems.  By bridging the gap between macroscopic surgical techniques and the underlying microscopic quantum reality, we aim to illuminate pathways for future innovations in minimally invasive surgical methodologies and instrument development.
