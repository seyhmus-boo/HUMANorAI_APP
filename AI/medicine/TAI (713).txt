Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain complex and multifaceted, demanding ongoing critical analysis. This presentation examines key ethical dilemmas arising throughout the transplantation process, from donor consent and procurement to allocation and post-transplant care.  We will explore the tension between maximizing the number of successful transplants and upholding the principles of autonomy, beneficence, and justice.  The challenges of defining death, particularly brain death, and the potential for coercion in live donation will be critically discussed.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the inherent inequalities in access to transplantation, focusing on disparities based on socioeconomic status, race, and geographic location.  We will analyze the role of allocation systems in mitigating these inequalities and consider the ethical implications of various allocation criteria, including medical urgency and waiting time. Finally, we will briefly consider emerging technologies, such as xenotransplantation and 3D-printed organs, and their associated ethical implications.  The presentation aims to stimulate discussion and highlight the need for ongoing ethical reflection in this vital area of medicine.
