Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain complex and multifaceted, demanding ongoing critical analysis.  This paper explores key ethical dilemmas inherent in the process, focusing on three primary areas. Firstly, the allocation of scarce organs necessitates a just and equitable system, transcending issues of socioeconomic status, race, and influence.  The challenge lies in balancing utilitarian principles of maximizing benefit with deontological concerns for individual rights and fairness. Secondly, informed consent, a cornerstone of medical ethics, presents unique challenges in the context of organ donation, particularly with regard to living donors and the potential for coercion or undue influence.  The balance between altruism and potential self-harm requires careful ethical navigation.  Finally, the potential for commodification of organs raises serious concerns, potentially exacerbating existing health inequities and undermining the intrinsic value of human life.  This paper argues for a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating philosophical, legal, and sociological perspectives, to develop robust ethical frameworks for navigating the complexities of organ transplantation.
