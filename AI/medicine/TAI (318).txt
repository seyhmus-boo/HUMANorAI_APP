The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Early research, focusing on identifying individual oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes like *p53*, provided foundational knowledge.  However, the complexity of cancer, with its heterogeneous nature and multitude of driver mutations, necessitated a more comprehensive approach.  The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), has dramatically accelerated progress.  NGS allows for comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, identifying specific mutations driving individual cancers and informing targeted therapies.

This has led to significant advancements in personalized medicine, enabling the selection of patients most likely to benefit from specific therapies based on their tumor's genetic profile.  Examples include the use of EGFR inhibitors in lung cancers with specific EGFR mutations and BRAF inhibitors in melanoma with BRAF V600E mutations.  However, challenges remain.  The cost and accessibility of NGS, the interpretation of complex genomic data, and the emergence of drug resistance highlight ongoing limitations.  Future research should focus on developing more cost-effective and accessible technologies, refining predictive biomarkers, and understanding the interplay between tumor genetics and the host immune system to further optimize personalized cancer treatment.
