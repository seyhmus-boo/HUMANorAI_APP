Adolescents experience a significant rise in mental health disorders, presenting unique challenges for research and treatment. This presentation will explore current trends in adolescent mental health, focusing on the increasing prevalence of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviours, and highlighting the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors.  We will then discuss the experimental difficulties inherent in researching and treating these disorders in this population.  Ethical considerations, including informed consent and the vulnerability of young participants, pose significant barriers to robust experimental designs.  Furthermore, the rapidly evolving developmental landscape during adolescence complicates the interpretation of longitudinal studies and the generalizability of findings across age groups. The inherent heterogeneity of symptoms and comorbidities further exacerbates the challenge of establishing effective treatment protocols.  Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss promising avenues for overcoming these limitations, such as innovative research designs incorporating mixed-methods approaches, the development of age-appropriate assessment tools, and the integration of technological advancements in data collection and analysis.
