Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges inherent in leveraging the genetic basis of cancer for personalized medicine advancements.  While genomic sequencing offers unprecedented insights into tumour heterogeneity and driver mutations, translating this knowledge into effective targeted therapies presents significant hurdles.  Firstly, identifying truly actionable mutations amidst the background of passenger mutations remains a considerable challenge.  Secondly, the dynamic nature of cancer, with its propensity for clonal evolution and the emergence of drug resistance, necessitates longitudinal monitoring and adaptive therapeutic strategies, requiring sophisticated experimental designs and bioinformatic analysis.  Furthermore, the complexity of tumour microenvironments and their interplay with the immune system complicates preclinical modelling and prediction of clinical responses.  Finally, the development of robust, cost-effective, and accessible assays for routine genetic profiling across diverse patient populations remains a critical technological bottleneck.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is essential for realizing the full potential of personalized oncology.
