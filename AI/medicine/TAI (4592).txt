Adolescence, a period of significant physical and psychological transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and development of mental health disorders.  This paper examines current trends in adolescent mental health, focusing on the prevalence and changing nature of common disorders such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse. While advancements in diagnostic tools and therapeutic approaches have been made, significant experimental challenges hinder effective research and treatment implementation.  These challenges include the inherent difficulties in accurately assessing subjective experiences in young people, the complexity of disentangling developmental factors from environmental influences, and the ethical considerations surrounding interventions in a vulnerable population. Furthermore, the heterogeneity of disorders and the comorbidity frequently observed complicate both diagnostic classification and treatment response.  This review will explore these challenges, examining the limitations of existing research methodologies and highlighting the need for innovative approaches, such as longitudinal studies incorporating diverse assessment measures and sophisticated statistical modelling techniques, to better understand and address the burgeoning mental health crisis among adolescents.
