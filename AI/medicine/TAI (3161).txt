Adolescents experience a significant rise in mental health disorders, exhibiting complex trends influenced by societal factors and developmental vulnerabilities.  Prevalence rates for conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders have demonstrably increased in recent decades, with significant disparities observed across socioeconomic strata and demographic groups.  These trends are likely multifactorial, encompassing increased academic pressures, social media influences, and evolving family structures.  Treatment approaches are increasingly emphasizing evidence-based practices, with a shift towards integrated care models that address the biopsychosocial dimensions of adolescent mental health.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) remain prominent therapeutic modalities, alongside pharmacological interventions, carefully considered and monitored due to potential long-term effects on developing brains.  Furthermore, there's a growing emphasis on early intervention and prevention programs aimed at fostering resilience and promoting mental wellness in youth through school-based initiatives and community resources.  Future research should focus on understanding the complex interplay of risk factors and refining treatment approaches tailored to the specific needs and developmental stage of individual adolescents.
