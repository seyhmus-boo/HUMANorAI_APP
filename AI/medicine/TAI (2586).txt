Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant global health concern, exhibiting evolving trends and requiring ongoing refinement of treatment strategies. Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with diagnoses and interventions lagging behind those for adults.  However, increased recognition in recent decades has spurred epidemiological research revealing rising rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm, particularly among girls.  These trends are likely multifactorial, influenced by societal changes, increased academic pressure, and readily available social media impacting self-esteem and body image.  Treatment approaches have evolved from primarily psychodynamic therapies to encompass a wider range of evidence-based interventions. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and other psychotherapies are now widely recommended, often integrated with pharmacological treatments, particularly for severe conditions.  However, access to appropriate care remains a critical barrier, particularly in low-resource settings.  Future research needs to focus on early detection and preventative strategies, addressing societal determinants of mental health, and developing culturally sensitive and accessible treatments tailored to the specific developmental needs of adolescents, considering the impact of digital technology and social media.
