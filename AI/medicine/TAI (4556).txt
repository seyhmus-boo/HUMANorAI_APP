Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, transitioning from rudimentary approaches to sophisticated techniques leveraging advanced technology. This presentation traces the evolution of MIS, highlighting key milestones and technological advancements that have driven this transformation.  Early laparoscopic cholecystectomies, pioneered in the late 1980s, marked a significant departure from open surgery, demonstrating the feasibility of performing complex procedures through small incisions.  The initial limitations of laparoscopy, such as restricted visualization and dexterity, spurred the development of enhanced instrumentation, including improved laparoscopes, energy devices, and robotic systems.

The advent of robotic surgery, with its enhanced precision and ergonomics, has further refined MIS capabilities, allowing for complex procedures previously deemed impossible through minimally invasive approaches.  Concurrent advances in imaging technology, such as 3D visualization and fluorescence imaging, have further improved surgical accuracy and safety.  This presentation will explore the iterative process of innovation in instrumentation, imaging, and surgical training, analyzing the impact of each advancement on patient outcomes and the expansion of MIS applications across diverse surgical specialties.  Finally, we will briefly consider future directions, including the potential of artificial intelligence and augmented reality in shaping the next generation of minimally invasive surgical techniques.
