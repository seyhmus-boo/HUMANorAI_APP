Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the concerning trends in adolescent mental health disorders and available treatments.  We've witnessed a significant rise in anxiety and depression diagnoses amongst this demographic, often linked to societal pressures, academic stress, and increased social media usage.  Furthermore,  eating disorders and substance abuse are prevalent, frequently co-occurring with primary diagnoses.  These trends necessitate a multi-faceted approach to treatment.

Therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) have proven highly effective in managing anxiety, depression, and emotional dysregulation.  Pharmacological interventions, while controversial, can be crucial adjuncts to therapy, particularly in severe cases.  Early intervention is paramount; recognising warning signs and seeking professional help promptly is vital.  Practical application involves educating adolescents, parents, and educators on identifying symptoms, fostering resilience, and promoting open communication about mental health.  The development of supportive school environments and readily accessible mental health services are equally crucial to mitigating these pressing trends and improving adolescent well-being.
