Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery times, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This paper examines the significant evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, tracing its development from initial laparoscopic approaches to the sophisticated robotic and enhanced-vision techniques employed today.  Early limitations, such as restricted dexterity and limited visualization, spurred significant technological advancements. This paper will analyze the key milestones in this progression, focusing on innovations in instrumentation, imaging technology, and surgical workflow.  Practical applications have been transformative across numerous surgical specialties.  From cholecystectomies and appendectomies to complex procedures like cardiac surgery and neurosurgery, MIS has demonstrably improved patient outcomes, reducing complications like infection and postoperative pain.  The increased precision and control offered by advanced techniques, coupled with smaller incisions, lead to decreased hospital stays, improved cosmetic results, and enhanced patient quality of life. This study will explore the impact of these evolving techniques on patient care and future directions in the field of MIS.
