Vaccination constitutes a cornerstone of public health, demonstrably preventing and controlling infectious diseases worldwide.  This lecture explores the mechanism by which vaccines confer immunity.  Through the introduction of attenuated or inactivated pathogens, or their antigenic components, vaccines stimulate the adaptive immune system.  This elicits the production of memory B and T cells, providing long-term protection against subsequent exposure to the target pathogen.  The resultant immunological memory allows for a rapid and robust response, preventing disease progression or significantly mitigating its severity.  Historically, vaccination campaigns have eradicated smallpox and drastically reduced the incidence of diseases such as polio, measles, and rubella.  However, vaccine hesitancy and incomplete global vaccination coverage remain significant challenges, necessitating continuous public health efforts to promote vaccine uptake and ensure optimal herd immunity.  Further research focuses on developing safer and more effective vaccines, including mRNA and novel vector-based platforms, to address emerging and re-emerging infectious threats.
