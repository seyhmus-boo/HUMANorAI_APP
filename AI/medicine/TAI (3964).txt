Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery times, has revolutionized surgical practice. This paper explores the significant evolution of surgical techniques within the MIS field, tracing its trajectory from initial pioneering efforts to the sophisticated approaches prevalent today.  Early MIS, largely driven by advancements in endoscopy, focused on laparoscopic techniques, primarily employing rigid instruments and limited maneuverability. However, subsequent decades have witnessed a dramatic acceleration in innovation, fueled by technological advancements and a deeper understanding of surgical anatomy and physiology.  Recent developments include the rise of robotic surgery, offering enhanced dexterity and precision via articulated instruments controlled remotely, and single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), aiming to further minimize invasiveness through reduced port numbers or utilizing natural body orifices.  Furthermore, advancements in imaging technologies, such as augmented reality and intraoperative 3D imaging, are enhancing surgical precision and facilitating complex procedures.  This review will analyze these key technological and procedural advancements, focusing on their impact on surgical outcomes, patient recovery, and the future trajectory of MIS.
