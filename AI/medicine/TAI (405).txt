Mental health disorders in adolescents are a growing global concern, exhibiting complex trends influenced by sociocultural factors, technological advancements, and biological vulnerabilities.  This abstract summarizes recent research highlighting escalating rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm among adolescents, particularly in the context of increased social media usage and academic pressures.  Treatment approaches are evolving, shifting from predominantly pharmacological interventions to a greater emphasis on integrated care models combining psychotherapy, particularly Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), with family-based interventions and peer support.  Early identification through school-based screening programs and readily accessible mental health services are crucial for improving outcomes.  This necessitates further research into culturally sensitive and digitally-delivered interventions to bridge accessibility gaps.  Practical applications include implementing universal mental health education in schools, training teachers to identify early warning signs, and expanding access to evidence-based therapies through telehealth platforms.  Such proactive strategies are essential to mitigate the long-term impact of adolescent mental health disorders and promote overall well-being.
