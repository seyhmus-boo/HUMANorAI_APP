Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma and faster recovery.  This presentation explores the evolutionary trajectory of MIS techniques, highlighting the persistent experimental challenges encountered in achieving optimal outcomes.  Early developments, largely focused on laparoscopy, faced significant hurdles in dexterity, visualization, and instrument limitations.  The introduction of robotic surgery addressed some of these, but presented new challenges related to cost, system complexity, and the development of intuitive interfaces.  Ongoing research is addressing these limitations through advancements in image-guided surgery, flexible endoscopy, and novel surgical tools.  This includes the development of advanced haptic feedback systems to improve dexterity and the integration of artificial intelligence for real-time assistance and improved surgical planning.  However, experimental validation remains crucial, requiring robust preclinical models, rigorous comparative studies, and long-term follow-up to assess the efficacy and safety of new techniques.  The presentation will conclude by discussing the future directions of MIS, emphasizing the critical role of continued experimental innovation in refining techniques and maximizing patient benefits.
