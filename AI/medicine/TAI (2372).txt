Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, jeopardizing the effectiveness of treatments for bacterial infections.  This presentation addresses the critical experimental challenges hindering our understanding and combatting AR.  The complex interplay of bacterial genetics, evolutionary pressures, and environmental factors necessitates sophisticated experimental designs.  We will discuss the limitations of current *in vitro* models, which often fail to recapitulate the complexities of *in vivo* environments, leading to inaccurate predictions of resistance development and transmission.  Furthermore, the challenge of studying AR in diverse microbial communities, including the human microbiome, requires innovative high-throughput approaches capable of resolving complex interactions.  The ethical considerations surrounding human-based studies further complicate the acquisition of robust data. Finally, we will explore the need for standardized experimental protocols and data sharing initiatives to facilitate comparative analyses and accelerate the development of effective countermeasures.  Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial to developing novel strategies for combating AR and ensuring global health security.
