Mental health disorders in adolescents are a growing concern, exhibiting significant upward trends globally.  Anxiety disorders, depression, and substance abuse are particularly prevalent, often co-occurring and impacting academic performance, social relationships, and overall well-being.  These trends are attributed to a complex interplay of factors including genetic predisposition, societal pressures (academic competition, social media influence), and environmental stressors (family dysfunction, trauma).  Treatment approaches are increasingly multifaceted and evidence-based, incorporating psychotherapy and, where necessary, psychopharmacology.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are frequently utilized to address maladaptive thought patterns and coping mechanisms.  Pharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression and anxiety, are employed judiciously under the guidance of a psychiatrist, often in conjunction with therapy.  Practical applications include the implementation of school-based mental health programs offering early intervention and screening, the promotion of mental health literacy among parents and educators to facilitate early identification and support-seeking, and the development of community resources providing accessible and affordable mental healthcare services tailored to adolescent needs.  Furthermore, research focusing on preventative strategies and personalized treatment approaches is crucial for mitigating the rising prevalence of these disorders.
