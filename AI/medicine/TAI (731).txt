Adolescents experience a disproportionately high burden of mental health disorders (MHDs), with significant implications for their developmental trajectory and long-term well-being.  This abstract examines recent trends and treatment approaches for common MHDs in this population.  Data consistently reveals rising prevalence rates for anxiety disorders, depression, and self-harm behaviours, potentially influenced by societal factors like increased social media usage and academic pressures.  Treatment access remains a critical challenge, with significant disparities based on socioeconomic status, geographic location, and cultural background.  While evidence-based treatments such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are effective for many, their implementation faces obstacles, including limited availability of trained professionals and stigma surrounding mental healthcare.  Emerging trends emphasize early intervention strategies, digital mental health platforms, and family-based therapies.  Future research should focus on improving access to culturally sensitive and affordable interventions, developing effective preventative measures, and addressing systemic barriers to care to mitigate the growing impact of MHDs on adolescent populations.  A multi-pronged approach encompassing individual, family, community, and societal levels is crucial for effectively addressing this critical public health concern.
