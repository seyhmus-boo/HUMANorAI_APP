Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant threat to global health, demanding urgent action.  This presentation will address the considerable experimental challenges in tackling this complex issue.  Current *in vitro* susceptibility testing, while standard, often fails to fully recapitulate the *in vivo* environment, leading to inaccurate predictions of clinical efficacy.  The heterogeneity of bacterial populations and the dynamic interplay of multiple resistance mechanisms further complicate experimental design.  Furthermore, the development of novel antibiotics is hampered by lengthy and expensive drug discovery pipelines, often yielding limited efficacy against resistant strains.  Studying AR in complex microbial communities, such as the gut microbiome, presents additional hurdles, requiring sophisticated high-throughput technologies and complex modelling approaches to disentangle the intricate interactions between resistant and susceptible bacteria.  This presentation will highlight these experimental limitations, emphasizing the need for innovative methodologies, such as advanced imaging techniques, microfluidic devices, and sophisticated mathematical modelling, to accurately assess AR, facilitate drug discovery, and ultimately inform effective global strategies to combat this escalating crisis.  Specifically, the discussion will focus on the challenges of accurately measuring resistance transfer, predicting the emergence of resistance, and testing the effectiveness of novel intervention strategies.
