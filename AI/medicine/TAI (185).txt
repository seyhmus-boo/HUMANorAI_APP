Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, with disorders often misattributed to typical teenage turmoil.  However, recent decades have witnessed a significant shift, revealing a concerning rise in prevalence rates for conditions like anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders among adolescents.  This increase is multifaceted, influenced by societal factors such as increased academic pressure, social media's impact on self-esteem and body image, and exposure to traumatic events.  Further complicating the picture is the diagnostic challenge, with symptoms often overlapping and presenting differently in young people compared to adults.

Treatment approaches have evolved alongside a greater understanding of adolescent neurodevelopment.  While psychopharmacology remains a key element, particularly for severe disorders, the emphasis is increasingly placed on integrated care models. These models incorporate evidence-based psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), alongside family therapy and peer support groups.  A crucial consideration is the promotion of early intervention and preventative strategies focusing on resilience-building and fostering supportive environments within schools and communities.  Future research must refine diagnostic criteria specific to adolescents and explore innovative digital therapeutic interventions to improve accessibility and outcomes.
