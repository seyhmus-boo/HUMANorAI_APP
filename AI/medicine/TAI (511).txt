Cancer is a complex disease driven by the accumulation of somatic mutations affecting diverse cellular pathways.  Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic landscape of cancer, revealing a remarkable heterogeneity across tumor types and even within individual tumors. This has fueled the development of personalized medicine approaches, aiming to tailor cancer treatment to the specific genetic profile of each patient.  This review summarizes recent breakthroughs in identifying driver mutations, characterizing genomic instability, and understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment in cancer development.  The application of these insights is exemplified by the success of targeted therapies, such as kinase inhibitors, that specifically target oncogenic mutations.  Furthermore, immunotherapy strategies, including checkpoint inhibitors and CAR T-cell therapy, are increasingly leveraging our knowledge of tumor mutational burden and neoantigen expression to improve patient outcomes.  Challenges remain, however, including the identification of effective therapeutic targets for many cancers, the development of resistance mechanisms, and the need for cost-effective and accessible genomic testing.  Future research should focus on integrating multi-omics data, refining predictive biomarkers, and developing novel therapeutic strategies to fully realize the potential of personalized cancer medicine.
