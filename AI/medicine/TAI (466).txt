Climate change poses a significant and evolving threat to global public health.  Historically, fluctuations in climate have influenced disease prevalence; for example, warmer temperatures and increased rainfall have facilitated the spread of vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever.  The current anthropogenic climate crisis exacerbates these existing vulnerabilities.  Rising temperatures contribute to heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns intensify the risk of waterborne diseases and malnutrition through impacts on agricultural yields.  Extreme weather events, increasingly frequent and intense due to climate change, cause direct injuries, displacement, and disruption of healthcare infrastructure, leading to secondary health impacts.  Furthermore, climate change contributes to air pollution, exacerbating respiratory illnesses.  While the impacts are globally distributed, vulnerable populations in low- and middle-income countries bear a disproportionate burden.  Addressing climate change through mitigation and adaptation strategies is crucial for protecting public health.  This necessitates interdisciplinary research integrating climate science, epidemiology, and public health policy to develop effective interventions and build resilient healthcare systems.
