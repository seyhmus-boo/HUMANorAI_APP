Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, necessitating an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding and effective mitigation.  This abstract highlights the complex interplay between climate change impacts and human health outcomes, emphasizing crucial interdisciplinary links.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly affecting vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns influence the distribution and prevalence of vector-borne diseases, requiring expertise from epidemiology, entomology, and climatology to predict and manage outbreaks.  Extreme weather events, including floods and droughts, displace populations, disrupt healthcare systems, and increase the risk of waterborne diseases and malnutrition, demanding contributions from public health, disaster management, and social sciences.  Further, air pollution exacerbated by climate change contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses, necessitating collaboration between atmospheric science and respiratory medicine.  Understanding these interlinked impacts requires integrating data from diverse fields to accurately assess risk, develop effective adaptation strategies, and advocate for robust climate policies that prioritize public health.  A truly interdisciplinary approach, involving natural scientists, social scientists, public health professionals, and policymakers, is crucial for addressing this critical global challenge.
