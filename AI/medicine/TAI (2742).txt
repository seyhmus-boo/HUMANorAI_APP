Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has evolved significantly from its rudimentary beginnings.  Early forms, dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, primarily involved the transmission of static images for diagnostic purposes.  However, the advent of digital technologies in the latter half of the 20th century, including the development of high-speed internet and sophisticated medical imaging systems, revolutionized the field.  Today, telemedicine encompasses a broad spectrum of services, ranging from simple virtual consultations and remote patient monitoring to complex procedures guided remotely by specialists. This expanded scope has significantly impacted modern healthcare delivery, improving access to care in geographically isolated areas and underserved populations. Furthermore, it enhances the efficiency of healthcare systems by facilitating quicker diagnoses, reducing hospital readmissions, and enabling proactive management of chronic conditions.  Despite its considerable advantages, the successful integration of telemedicine requires careful consideration of regulatory frameworks, cybersecurity measures, and the establishment of standardized protocols to ensure both patient safety and data privacy.
