Adolescent mental health disorders, encompassing conditions like depression, anxiety, and substance abuse, exhibit rising prevalence globally, influenced by complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors.  Trends indicate increased diagnoses, potentially reflecting improved recognition and screening, but also reflecting genuine increases stemming from societal stressors such as cyberbullying and social media pressures.  Effective treatment necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on expertise from psychiatry, psychology, and social work. Psychiatrists provide medication management, while psychologists employ evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to address underlying cognitive and emotional patterns.  Social workers contribute by addressing socio-environmental factors, connecting families with support systems, and navigating the complexities of school and community resources.  This collaborative model acknowledges the holistic nature of mental health, recognizing that biological vulnerabilities are exacerbated by psychosocial stressors and require multifaceted interventions for optimal outcomes.  Further research is crucial to refine early detection strategies and personalize treatment plans across diverse adolescent populations.
