Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIST) have undergone a dramatic evolution since their inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical skills.  This review summarizes key milestones in this progression. Early laparoscopic approaches, initially limited by two-dimensional visualization and bulky instrumentation, have been significantly enhanced by the advent of robotic surgery.  Robotic systems offer superior dexterity, three-dimensional vision, and enhanced precision, resulting in reduced trauma and improved patient outcomes.  Furthermore, advancements in energy sources, such as advanced bipolar and ultrasonic technologies, have refined tissue dissection and hemostasis.  Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) represents a further evolution, minimizing external incisions altogether, though its widespread adoption remains limited by technical challenges.  Concurrent improvements in imaging modalities, including 3D laparoscopy and intraoperative fluorescence imaging, significantly augment surgical precision and real-time assessment.  Despite these advancements, challenges remain, including the learning curve associated with advanced techniques, cost considerations, and the need for further research to optimize surgical outcomes and expand the applicability of MIST across diverse surgical specialties.  Future directions likely involve artificial intelligence integration for improved surgical planning and execution, furthering the potential of MIST to revolutionize surgical care.
