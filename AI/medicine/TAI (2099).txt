Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to mitigation.  This presentation explores the multifaceted nature of AR, highlighting the critical interconnectedness of various disciplines in addressing this complex challenge.  We will examine the ecological drivers of AR, focusing on the role of agricultural practices, wastewater management, and environmental contamination in the dissemination of resistant genes.  Furthermore, we will discuss the crucial role of  clinical microbiology and infectious disease epidemiology in surveillance, early detection, and the development of novel treatment strategies.  Crucially, we will analyze the societal dimensions of AR, including the economic burden of resistant infections, the ethical implications of antibiotic stewardship programs, and the impact on global health security.  The presentation concludes by advocating for strengthened interdisciplinary collaboration between scientists, clinicians, policymakers, and the public to foster effective strategies for combating AR and preserving the efficacy of existing antibiotics, emphasizing the urgent need for a One Health approach.  This integrated perspective is essential for developing sustainable and globally impactful solutions to this increasingly pressing global health crisis.
