Cancer, a complex group of diseases, has long challenged medical understanding.  Early research focused on broad classifications and treatment strategies, offering limited efficacy due to inherent inter-patient variability.  However, the advent of genomics revolutionized our perspective, revealing the intricate genetic landscape underlying cancer development.  This presentation will explore the significant advances in understanding the genetic basis of cancer, tracing its historical journey from chromosomal abnormalities identified through karyotyping to the current era of high-throughput sequencing technologies.  We will discuss the identification of key driver mutations, oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes, and their roles in cancer initiation and progression.  This detailed genetic characterization forms the cornerstone of personalized medicine, enabling the precise stratification of patients based on their tumor's genomic profile.  We will examine the impact of this progress on targeted therapies, immunotherapy approaches, and the development of predictive biomarkers for treatment response and prognosis.  Finally, we will discuss ongoing challenges and future directions, including the integration of multi-omics data and the development of sophisticated computational models to further refine personalized cancer treatment strategies.
