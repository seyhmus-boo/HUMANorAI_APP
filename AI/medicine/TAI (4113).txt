Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, significantly improving patient outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting key advancements from its nascent stages to contemporary practices.  Early laparoscopic approaches, pioneered in the late 20th century, represented a paradigm shift from traditional open surgery, employing small incisions and specialized instrumentation.  However, initial limitations included restricted dexterity and visualization challenges.  Subsequent innovations, including the development of advanced imaging technologies such as high-definition cameras and improved lighting, significantly enhanced surgical precision.  The introduction of robotic-assisted surgery marked another pivotal moment, offering enhanced dexterity, tremor filtration, and 3D visualization, leading to improved accuracy and reduced invasiveness.  Further advancements encompass single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), pushing the boundaries towards scarless procedures.  This presentation will analyze the historical context of these developments, assess their impact on surgical outcomes, and discuss the future trajectory of MIS, including the potential role of artificial intelligence and augmented reality in shaping next-generation minimally invasive surgical techniques.
