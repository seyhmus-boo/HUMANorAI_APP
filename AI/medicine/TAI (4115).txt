This presentation examines recent trends and treatment developments concerning mental health disorders in adolescents.  The prevalence of anxiety, depression, and self-harm is escalating globally, demanding urgent attention.  We will explore contributing factors, including increased social media use, academic pressure, and societal changes, highlighting the complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social determinants.

Recent research emphasizes the efficacy of early intervention and personalized treatment approaches. We will review emerging evidence on the effectiveness of digital therapeutics, such as mobile apps and online cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), in providing accessible and scalable mental health support.  Furthermore, advancements in neuroscience are informing the development of novel pharmacotherapies, while integrated care models are gaining traction, promoting collaboration between mental health professionals and primary care providers.  

The presentation will conclude by discussing the critical need for improved access to mental health services, reduced stigma surrounding mental illness, and investment in preventative strategies targeting adolescents at risk. We will underscore the importance of tailored interventions that consider the unique developmental needs and vulnerabilities of this age group.
