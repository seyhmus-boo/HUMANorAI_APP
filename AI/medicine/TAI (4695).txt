This presentation explores the burgeoning intersection of climate change and public health through a novel lens: quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate, the connection lies in the intricate, non-linear systems governing both domains. Climate change, driven by complex interactions of atmospheric components, demonstrates emergent behavior analogous to quantum many-body systems.  Similarly, human health is a complex quantum-like system influenced by a vast array of interconnected factors, from genetics to environmental exposures. We argue that a quantum-inspired framework, employing concepts like entanglement and superposition to model system interactions, offers a more comprehensive understanding of climate-related health impacts than classical approaches.  Specifically, we discuss how a quantum-like modeling approach can better capture the cascading effects of climate change on infectious disease spread, heat stress vulnerability, and mental health outcomes.  The presentation will briefly explore the application of quantum computing algorithms to analyze large datasets on climate variables and health indicators, potentially leading to improved predictive capabilities and more effective public health interventions. We conclude by highlighting the potential for this interdisciplinary approach to drive innovative solutions in mitigating climate change's detrimental impact on global health.
