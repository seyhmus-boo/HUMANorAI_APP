Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical techniques.  Early MIS relied heavily on laparoscopy, utilizing rigid endoscopes and limited instrument articulation, resulting in procedural limitations.  Subsequent innovations, including the development of flexible endoscopes and robotic-assisted surgery (RAS), significantly expanded surgical capabilities.  RAS systems offer enhanced dexterity, precision, and 3D visualization, overcoming the limitations of traditional laparoscopy.  Concurrent improvements in energy sources, such as bipolar coagulation and ultrasonic shears, have refined tissue dissection and hemostasis, minimizing collateral damage.  Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) represents a further evolution, pursuing completely scarless approaches, though its widespread adoption remains limited by technological and logistical challenges.  Ongoing research focuses on refining existing techniques, exploring novel imaging modalities like augmented reality, and developing advanced robotic platforms, promising further minimization of surgical trauma and improved patient outcomes.
