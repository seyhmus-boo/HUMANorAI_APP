Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice, significantly improving patient outcomes.  This paper examines the evolutionary trajectory of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving its progress.  From the early adoption of laparoscopy in the mid-20th century to the sophisticated robotic-assisted and image-guided procedures of today, the field has witnessed rapid technological advancements.  This evolution has not been solely driven by surgical innovation, but rather by a complex interplay between engineering, imaging sciences, materials science, and computer science.  This interdisciplinary synergy has facilitated the development of smaller and more dexterous instruments, advanced imaging modalities for precise visualization, and sophisticated software for surgical planning and simulation.  We will explore the key milestones in the evolution of MIS techniques, analyzing the specific contributions of each discipline and investigating how their collaborative efforts have shaped current surgical practice.  Furthermore, we will discuss the ongoing challenges and future directions of MIS, emphasizing the continued need for interdisciplinary research to optimize patient safety and expand the scope of minimally invasive approaches.
