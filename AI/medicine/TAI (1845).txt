Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This paper examines the complex and evolving relationship between a changing climate and its impacts on human health outcomes.  We explore the direct and indirect pathways through which climate change exerts its influence, encompassing both acute and chronic health effects.  Direct impacts include increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the spread of vector-borne diseases, and exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to worsening air quality.  Indirect effects are equally important and encompass disruptions to food security, water scarcity, displacement and migration patterns, and the potential for increased mental health issues stemming from climate-related trauma and anxieties.  This research synthesizes existing literature to assess the current understanding of these diverse health impacts, highlighting regional variations and vulnerable populations disproportionately affected.  Furthermore, we analyze the challenges in accurately quantifying these effects and propose strategies for strengthening surveillance systems and implementing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies to safeguard public health in the face of a changing climate.  The paper concludes with a discussion of future research needs and policy implications to foster climate-resilient health systems.
