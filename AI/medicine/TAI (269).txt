Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health globally.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations. Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to increased risks of waterborne diseases and vector-borne infections like malaria and dengue fever.  Extreme weather events, such as floods and hurricanes, cause direct injuries and fatalities, displace populations, and disrupt essential health services, leading to secondary health impacts.  Further, climate change impacts food security and nutrition, increasing malnutrition and related health problems.  These impacts disproportionately affect low-income communities and developing nations with limited adaptive capacity.  Practical applications of this understanding include developing early warning systems for heat waves and infectious disease outbreaks, improving infrastructure resilience to extreme weather, enhancing surveillance systems for climate-sensitive diseases, and promoting public health interventions targeting vulnerable populations.  Furthermore, integrating climate change considerations into health policy and planning, including resource allocation and mitigation strategies, is crucial for safeguarding public health in a changing climate.  Robust research and international collaboration are essential to effectively address the complex interplay between climate change and public health.
