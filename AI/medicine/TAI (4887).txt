Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are typically framed within classical bioethics.  However, a quantum mechanical perspective offers a novel lens through which to examine these complex issues.  This presentation explores the potential implications of quantum entanglement and superposition for the ethical discourse surrounding organ donation and transplantation.  We argue that the inherent interconnectedness suggested by quantum mechanics, particularly in biological systems, challenges the traditional notion of the individual as a discrete entity.  This has ramifications for consent, particularly in cases of deceased donation where the precise moment of death remains ambiguous in light of quantum indeterminacy. Furthermore, the probabilistic nature of quantum events raises questions about the predictability and efficacy of transplantation outcomes, thus influencing the allocation of scarce resources.  We will discuss the ethical implications of incorporating a quantum understanding of biological systems into the decision-making processes surrounding organ transplantation, suggesting that a move beyond purely classical frameworks is necessary to account for the inherent uncertainty and interconnectedness at the fundamental level of reality.  This interdisciplinary approach could foster a more nuanced and holistic ethical framework for this crucial field.
