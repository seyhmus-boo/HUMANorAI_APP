Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times. This presentation explores the significant evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, tracing its progression from early laparoscopic approaches to the sophisticated robotic and enhanced visualization techniques available today.  We will examine key advancements, including the development of smaller instruments, improved energy sources (e.g., ultrasonic dissection), and the integration of advanced imaging modalities such as 3D laparoscopy and fluorescence imaging.  The impact of robotic surgery, with its enhanced dexterity and precision, will be discussed, alongside emerging techniques like single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).  Practical applications will be highlighted, focusing on improvements in specific surgical specialties. Examples include enhanced precision in colorectal resections, less invasive approaches to bariatric surgery, and improved outcomes in complex gynecological procedures. Finally, we will briefly address current challenges and future directions in MIS, including the development of artificial intelligence-assisted surgery and the expansion of applications to previously inaccessible surgical sites.
