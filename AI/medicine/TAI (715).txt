This presentation examines the evolving landscape of mental health disorders in adolescents, tracing historical trends and contemporary treatment approaches.  Historically, adolescent mental health issues were often overlooked or misattributed, with limited diagnostic frameworks and intervention strategies.  The 20th century witnessed a gradual shift, culminating in the development of the DSM and ICD classifications, albeit with ongoing debates regarding diagnostic criteria and the impact of societal factors.  Recent decades have shown a concerning rise in the prevalence of anxiety and depression among young people, potentially linked to increased academic pressure, social media usage, and societal upheaval.

This presentation will explore these trends, examining epidemiological data on prevalent disorders such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.  Furthermore, it will discuss the efficacy of contemporary treatments, including evidence-based psychotherapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), alongside the role of psychopharmacology in managing severe symptoms. The limitations of current approaches and emerging therapeutic strategies, such as digital interventions and integrated care models, will also be considered.  Finally, we will discuss the crucial need for early identification, comprehensive support systems, and a multidisciplinary approach to effectively address the growing mental health crisis among adolescents.
