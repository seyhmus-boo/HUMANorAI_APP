Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma and faster recovery.  However, the continued evolution of MIS techniques presents significant experimental challenges. This presentation explores the hurdles in translating innovative approaches from bench to bedside.  We will focus on three key areas:  first, the development of novel instrumentation, including robotic platforms and advanced energy sources, necessitates rigorous biocompatibility and performance testing under realistic simulated conditions.  Second, the translation of image-guided techniques, such as augmented reality and intraoperative imaging, demands robust validation studies to assess accuracy and impact on surgical precision and safety.  Finally, the advancement of surgical simulation and training methodologies requires the development of high-fidelity models that accurately mimic the complex biomechanical properties of tissues and organs.  Addressing these experimental challenges is critical to ensuring the safe and effective implementation of new MIS technologies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and expanding the scope of minimally invasive surgical applications.  This presentation will discuss ongoing research efforts and identify future directions for overcoming these limitations.
