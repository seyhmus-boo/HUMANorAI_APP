Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, driven by technological advancements and a pursuit of enhanced patient outcomes.  Early MIS techniques, primarily employing laparoscopy, were limited by two-dimensional visualization and cumbersome instrumentation.  The introduction of robotic-assisted surgery revolutionized the field, offering improved dexterity, three-dimensional visualization, and enhanced precision, particularly in complex procedures.  Simultaneously, advancements in imaging technologies, such as augmented reality and intraoperative ultrasound, have further enhanced surgical accuracy and reduced invasiveness.  Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) emerged as a radical approach, aiming for complete scarlessness, although its widespread adoption has been hindered by technical challenges.  Currently, research focuses on refining existing techniques, including single-port and suture-less approaches, and exploring novel technologies such as artificial intelligence and nanotechnology for improved tissue manipulation, hemostasis, and targeted drug delivery.  This continuous evolution promises further minimization of surgical trauma, reduced postoperative complications, faster recovery times, and ultimately, improved patient safety and quality of life.
