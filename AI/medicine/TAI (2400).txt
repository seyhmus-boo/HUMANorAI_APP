Antibiotic resistance, a growing global crisis, poses a significant threat to human health and global security.  This presentation will explore the historical trajectory of this challenge, from the initial discovery of penicillin and the subsequent "golden age" of antibiotics, to the present-day prevalence of resistant pathogens.  We will trace the evolution of resistance mechanisms, highlighting the role of selective pressure exerted by widespread antibiotic use in agriculture, healthcare, and human consumption.  The consequences of unchecked resistance are far-reaching, encompassing increased morbidity and mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, higher healthcare costs, and the potential resurgence of previously controllable infectious diseases.  The abstract will analyze the global implications of this crisis, including its disproportionate impact on low- and middle-income countries with limited access to diagnostic tools and effective treatment options.  Furthermore, we will briefly discuss current strategies aimed at combating resistance, focusing on the urgent need for responsible antibiotic stewardship, innovative drug development, and improved infection prevention and control practices.  The presentation will conclude by emphasizing the necessity for a multi-sectoral, global collaborative approach to mitigate this critical public health threat.
