Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, extending far beyond the traditionally recognized impacts.  Recent developments underscore the urgency of understanding and addressing this complex relationship.  This paper explores the evolving connections between a changing climate and human health outcomes, moving beyond established understandings of heat-related mortality and infectious disease spread.  We examine emerging evidence highlighting the amplified influence of climate change on air quality, resulting in increased respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular diseases.  Further, we consider the impact on mental health, with studies increasingly demonstrating correlations between extreme weather events and psychological distress.  Furthermore, the paper investigates the indirect consequences, such as food insecurity and displacement due to climate-related disasters, which exacerbate existing health inequalities and vulnerabilities.  Finally, we analyze recent advancements in modelling and prediction techniques aimed at quantifying the future burden of climate change on public health and informing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This research contributes to the growing body of literature urging proactive, interdisciplinary approaches to safeguard global health in the face of a rapidly changing climate.
