Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and mitigating its impacts. This presentation explores the complex relationship between climate change and public health outcomes, highlighting crucial interdisciplinary links. We will examine how changing climatic conditions – including rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and altered disease vector distributions – directly affect morbidity and mortality rates.  Key areas of investigation will encompass epidemiological studies demonstrating the correlation between climate-related stressors and the incidence of heatstroke, respiratory illnesses, and infectious diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.  Further, we will discuss the indirect impacts, such as food insecurity, water scarcity, and displacement, contributing to malnutrition, mental health issues, and social unrest.  The presentation will emphasize the critical need for collaborations between climatologists, epidemiologists, public health officials, social scientists, and policymakers. This interdisciplinary lens is essential for developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, ensuring equitable access to healthcare resources, and ultimately building climate-resilient health systems.  The goal is to underscore the urgency of collaborative research and policy action to protect public health in the face of a changing climate.
