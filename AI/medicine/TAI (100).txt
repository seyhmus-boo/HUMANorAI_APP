Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  The scarcity of donor organs necessitates difficult allocation decisions, akin to distributing a limited supply of life rafts amidst a shipwreck.  Utilitarian approaches, prioritizing the greatest good for the greatest number, might favour those with the highest chance of survival and societal contribution, resembling a triage system in a disaster zone. However, this risks overlooking factors like age, social status, or pre-existing conditions, potentially mirroring discriminatory resource allocation.

Deontological ethics, emphasizing inherent rights and duties, argues for equitable distribution regardless of societal value. This analogy might be a fair lottery system, where all equally deserving individuals have an equal chance, regardless of background.  Yet, determining "deservingness" itself poses a significant challenge.  Furthermore, the process of obtaining consent, especially from living donors, raises questions about coercion and the potential exploitation of vulnerable individuals, comparable to the ethical concerns surrounding blood donation from prisoners.  Navigating these ethical complexities requires a nuanced approach, balancing utilitarian efficiency with deontological fairness and protecting individual autonomy.
