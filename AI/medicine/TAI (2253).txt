Ethical considerations in organ transplantation have evolved alongside technological advancements, creating ongoing challenges for medical professionals and policymakers.  Historically, transplantation's early successes were overshadowed by practices lacking robust ethical frameworks, including the exploitation of vulnerable populations and a lack of informed consent.  The infamous "God Committee" in the 1960s, tasked with selecting recipients for limited resources, highlighted the societal anxieties and inherent biases in resource allocation.

Contemporary ethical dilemmas persist, centered around issues of donor consent (living versus deceased), equitable organ allocation, and the potential for commodification.  The prioritization of certain patient groups based on factors like age or lifestyle choices raises concerns about justice and fairness.  Furthermore, the increasing demand for organs juxtaposed against limited supply necessitates ongoing scrutiny of procurement practices and the prevention of coercion or exploitation.  This presentation will explore these key ethical dimensions, examining the historical context to better understand current debates around informed consent, equitable access, and the responsible governance of organ transplantation systems.  Finally, it will briefly discuss the potential implications of emerging technologies like xenotransplantation on existing ethical frameworks.
