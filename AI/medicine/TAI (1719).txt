Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding careful scrutiny.  This review examines key ethical challenges, focusing on issues of justice, autonomy, and beneficence.  Allocation of scarce organs often prioritizes factors like medical urgency and likelihood of success, raising questions of fairness and potential discrimination against certain patient populations.  The informed consent process, crucial for respecting donor autonomy, necessitates nuanced communication, particularly in cases involving living donors, who may face undue pressure or coercion.  Furthermore, the global disparity in organ availability highlights the ethical implications of organ tourism and the exploitation of vulnerable populations in source countries.  This review also touches upon the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation, raising further concerns regarding animal welfare and potential risks of zoonotic disease transmission.  Ultimately, navigating these ethical dilemmas necessitates a robust, transparent, and equitable framework that prioritizes patient well-being, respects human dignity, and promotes just resource allocation in organ transplantation.  Further research is needed to address ongoing challenges and develop ethically sound practices for the future of transplantation medicine.
