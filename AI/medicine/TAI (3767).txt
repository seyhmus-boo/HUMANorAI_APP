Cancer's genetic basis, historically understood through broad classifications like carcinogens and tumor suppressor genes, has revolutionized personalized medicine.  Early research focused on identifying single gene mutations driving specific cancers, leading to targeted therapies like imatinib for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). However, this approach proved insufficient for many cancers displaying heterogeneous genetic profiles.

Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have dramatically expanded our understanding, revealing the complexity of cancer genomes.  NGS allows for comprehensive profiling of somatic mutations, copy number variations, and gene fusions within individual tumors. This wealth of genomic data fuels the development of personalized therapies.  

Consequently, personalized oncology utilizes genomic profiling to identify actionable mutations guiding targeted therapy selection.  Furthermore, it enables predictive biomarker identification, informing treatment efficacy and toxicity predictions.  Challenges remain, including the cost and complexity of NGS, the need for robust bioinformatics tools for data analysis, and the potential for treatment resistance due to evolving tumor genotypes.  Nonetheless, the genetic basis of cancer, coupled with NGS technology, underpins the continuing progress in personalized medicine, paving the way for more effective and tailored cancer treatments.
