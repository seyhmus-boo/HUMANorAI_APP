Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, demanding urgent attention and innovative solutions. This presentation will address critical experimental challenges hindering the effective combatting of AR.  Current methodologies for detecting and characterizing resistant strains often lack speed, sensitivity, and high-throughput capacity, limiting our ability to track the spread of resistance genes and inform public health interventions.  Furthermore, the complex interplay between bacterial genetics, host immunity, and environmental factors complicates the development of robust in vitro and in vivo models that accurately reflect the complexities of infection dynamics.  The heterogeneity within bacterial populations and the emergence of novel resistance mechanisms further challenge the efficacy of conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing and the design of effective therapies.  We will discuss the limitations of current experimental approaches, including the challenges associated with phenotypic screening, genomic analysis, and the development of animal models for AR research. Finally, we will propose potential avenues for improvement, highlighting the need for innovative technologies, such as advanced genomic sequencing and AI-powered diagnostics, coupled with the development of more sophisticated, physiologically relevant experimental models to propel research and ultimately curb the global spread of AR.
