Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, demanding urgent attention. This review summarizes the current state of knowledge regarding AR's multifaceted implications.  The widespread overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, have driven the selection and propagation of resistant pathogens.  This has led to a dramatic increase in treatment failures for common bacterial infections, impacting healthcare systems worldwide.  The economic burden is substantial, encompassing increased healthcare costs, lost productivity, and potential disruptions to global trade.  Moreover, AR exacerbates mortality rates, particularly impacting vulnerable populations.  While the development of new antibiotics is crucial, the review emphasizes the critical need for a multi-pronged approach. This includes strengthening stewardship programs, improving infection prevention and control measures, promoting hygiene practices, accelerating research into alternative therapeutic strategies (e.g., phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides), and investing in surveillance systems to monitor resistance patterns.  Addressing this global challenge requires concerted international collaboration, policy interventions, and a fundamental shift towards responsible antibiotic use.
