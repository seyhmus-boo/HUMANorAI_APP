Cancer, a complex group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, remains a significant global health challenge.  While traditional cancer treatments have shown efficacy, their effectiveness is often limited by inter-patient heterogeneity and adverse side effects.  Recent advancements in understanding the genetic basis of cancer have revolutionized the field, paving the way for the development of personalized medicine approaches. This review explores the significant strides made in elucidating the intricate genetic landscape of various cancers, focusing on the identification of driver mutations, oncogenic pathways, and tumor microenvironment interactions.  Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling, allowing for the precise identification of somatic mutations, copy number variations, and gene fusions specific to individual tumors. This wealth of genomic data has facilitated the development of targeted therapies, immunotherapy strategies tailored to specific tumor mutational burdens, and improved prognostic and diagnostic tools.  Furthermore, we will discuss the emerging roles of liquid biopsies and circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in monitoring treatment response and detecting minimal residual disease, highlighting the potential for earlier intervention and improved patient outcomes in the era of personalized cancer medicine.
