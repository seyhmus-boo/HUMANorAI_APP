Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, demanding urgent attention. This presentation will explore the multifaceted implications of AR, focusing on recent developments in its epidemiology, mechanisms, and mitigation strategies.  The rise of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly in healthcare settings and within specific bacterial species like *Acinetobacter baumannii* and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, will be highlighted, emphasizing the associated increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  Recent advancements in genomic surveillance, enabling rapid identification and tracking of resistant strains, will be discussed, along with the development of novel diagnostic tools facilitating early detection and informed treatment decisions.  Furthermore, the presentation will address promising avenues for novel antibiotic development, including the repurposing of existing drugs and the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies like phage therapy and antimicrobial peptides.  Finally, it will emphasize the crucial role of global collaboration, strengthened stewardship programs, and public health initiatives in combating the global spread of AR and safeguarding the effectiveness of existing antibiotics.
