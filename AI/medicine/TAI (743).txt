Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health globally.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns increase the risk of waterborne diseases and vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever.  Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, lead to injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences.  Further, disruptions to food security and agricultural systems contribute to malnutrition and increased disease susceptibility.  This complex interplay underscores the urgent need for integrated strategies addressing both climate mitigation and adaptation to safeguard public health.  Practical applications include developing early warning systems for extreme weather events, implementing heat action plans in urban areas, improving vector control measures, and strengthening public health infrastructure resilience.  Investing in climate-resilient food systems and promoting sustainable urban planning are crucial for mitigating climate change's impact on public health.  Interdisciplinary research and robust policy interventions are essential to effectively address this critical global challenge and safeguard human well-being in the face of a changing climate.
