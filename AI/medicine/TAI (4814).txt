Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting normal cellular processes like proliferation and apoptosis.  The genetic basis of cancer is highly heterogeneous, with different cancers exhibiting unique mutational profiles. This understanding underpins the burgeoning field of personalized medicine, aiming to tailor cancer treatment to individual genetic makeup.

Recent advances leverage next-generation sequencing (NGS) to comprehensively profile tumor genomes, identifying driver mutations crucial for cancer development and progression. This allows for the identification of specific therapeutic targets and the prediction of treatment response.  Immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors, has revolutionized cancer treatment by harnessing the patient's own immune system, with success largely determined by tumor mutational burden (TMB).  Furthermore, liquid biopsies, analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), offer minimally invasive methods for monitoring disease progression, detecting recurrence, and guiding treatment adjustments in real-time.  Ongoing research focuses on integrating genomic data with other omics information (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) to further refine personalized treatment strategies and develop novel therapeutic approaches, including targeted therapies and gene editing techniques.
