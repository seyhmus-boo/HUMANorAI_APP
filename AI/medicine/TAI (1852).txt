Organ transplantation, while offering a life-saving intervention, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  Central to these is the allocation of scarce organs, necessitating a just and equitable distribution system.  Utilitarian approaches prioritize maximizing overall benefit, potentially favoring younger recipients with higher life expectancy, raising concerns about ageism and discrimination against older individuals.  Conversely, deontological perspectives emphasize individual rights and fairness, suggesting a lottery system or prioritization based on medical urgency.  

Further ethical complexities arise around informed consent, particularly concerning deceased donors and the potential for coercion of living donors.  Ensuring genuine autonomy and avoiding undue influence from family members or healthcare providers is paramount.  Furthermore, the definition of death itself remains a debated topic, impacting the availability of organs.  The commercialization of organs, though largely illegal, presents a significant ethical concern, potentially exploiting vulnerable populations.  Practical applications of ethical frameworks involve transparent allocation policies, robust informed consent procedures, and rigorous oversight to prevent exploitation and ensure equitable access to life-saving transplantation.
