Climate change, driven primarily by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, presents a profound and multifaceted threat to global public health.  While the immediate consequences of extreme weather events – heatwaves, floods, and droughts – are readily apparent, the long-term impacts are more insidious and far-reaching. Historically, the relationship between environmental factors and health has been understood since antiquity, with Hippocrates noting the influence of climate on disease prevalence. However, the scale and speed of contemporary climate change necessitate a reassessment of this relationship.  The 20th and early 21st centuries have witnessed a dramatic acceleration in greenhouse gas accumulation, leading to observable shifts in global temperature and precipitation patterns.  This paper examines the complex interplay between climate change and public health, moving beyond the well-documented effects of extreme weather to explore the less visible but equally significant consequences. We will analyze the expanding influence on vector-borne diseases, respiratory illnesses exacerbated by air pollution, the impact on mental health through displacement and trauma, and the implications for food security and nutrition.  Ultimately, this research aims to highlight the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to mitigate climate change and build resilient health systems capable of addressing its escalating public health ramifications.
