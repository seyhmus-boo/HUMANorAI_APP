Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, often dismissed as "typical teenage angst."  However,  recent decades have witnessed a significant shift, with a growing recognition of the prevalence and severity of mental health disorders in this population.  Trends indicate a concerning rise in anxiety and depression, particularly among girls, potentially linked to increased societal pressures and social media usage.  Eating disorders, substance abuse, and self-harm also remain significant concerns.  

Treatment approaches have evolved alongside this increased awareness.  Traditional psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), remain cornerstones, effectively targeting maladaptive thought patterns and behaviours.  Pharmacological interventions, while used judiciously, are increasingly employed in conjunction with therapy, particularly for severe cases.  Early intervention and family-based approaches are gaining traction, acknowledging the crucial role of familial support systems in adolescent mental health outcomes.  Further research focusing on preventative strategies and culturally sensitive interventions is urgently needed to address the escalating challenges.
