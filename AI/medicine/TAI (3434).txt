This presentation explores the multifaceted role of vaccination in preventing infectious diseases, highlighting key interdisciplinary linkages crucial for successful implementation and impact.  We move beyond a purely biomedical perspective, emphasizing the social, economic, and ethical dimensions interwoven with vaccination programs.  The success of vaccination hinges not only on the efficacy of vaccines themselves, but also on robust public health infrastructure, effective communication strategies to address vaccine hesitancy (drawing on psychology and communication science), and equitable access informed by social determinants of health research.  Economic analyses are vital in assessing cost-effectiveness and resource allocation, while ethical considerations surrounding mandatory vaccination and informed consent require careful philosophical and legal deliberation.  This interdisciplinary approach underscores the need for collaborative efforts between biomedical researchers, public health professionals, social scientists, economists, ethicists, and policymakers to optimize vaccination strategies and achieve global health goals.  We will discuss specific case studies illustrating the impact of these interdisciplinary collaborations on improving vaccination coverage and reducing the burden of preventable diseases worldwide.
