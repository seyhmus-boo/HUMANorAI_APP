This presentation explores the burgeoning field of applying quantum-inspired computational models to understand and treat mental health disorders in adolescents.  Traditional approaches often struggle with the complex, interconnected nature of adolescent mental health, characterized by fluctuating symptom presentations and intricate interactions between biological, psychological, and social factors.  We propose that quantum-like features, such as superposition and entanglement, can offer novel frameworks for modelling these intricate dynamics.  Specifically, we will examine how quantum algorithms, such as quantum annealing and variational quantum eigensolvers, may enhance the predictive power of existing machine learning models used in early detection and personalized treatment planning.  We will discuss the potential for developing quantum-enhanced therapies, focusing on the ability of quantum-inspired methods to optimize existing psychological interventions, such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), by tailoring them to individual patient profiles. While acknowledging the current limitations of quantum computing hardware, we will highlight the theoretical potential and ongoing research that could revolutionize our understanding and treatment of adolescent mental health disorders in the future.  This research contributes to a paradigm shift, moving beyond classical computational approaches towards a more nuanced and potentially more effective understanding of adolescent mental health.
