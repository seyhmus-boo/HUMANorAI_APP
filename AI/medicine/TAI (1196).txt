The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance represent a significant global health threat, jeopardizing the effectiveness of treatments for bacterial infections.  The historical trajectory of this crisis is inextricably linked to the widespread use of antibiotics following their discovery in the mid-20th century.  Initially hailed as miracle drugs, antibiotics dramatically reduced mortality from infectious diseases, leading to their extensive application in both human and veterinary medicine, as well as agriculture.  However, this widespread use inadvertently accelerated the selection pressure favouring the survival and proliferation of resistant bacterial strains.  Mechanisms of resistance include enzymatic inactivation of antibiotics, alteration of antibiotic targets, and decreased permeability of the bacterial cell wall. The global implications are profound, with increased morbidity and mortality associated with untreatable infections.  This is particularly concerning in low- and middle-income countries lacking robust healthcare infrastructure and surveillance systems. Furthermore, the economic burden associated with managing resistant infections, including prolonged hospital stays and the development of novel therapeutics, is substantial, placing significant strain on healthcare systems worldwide.  Consequently, the development and implementation of effective strategies to combat antibiotic resistance are crucial for preserving public health globally.
