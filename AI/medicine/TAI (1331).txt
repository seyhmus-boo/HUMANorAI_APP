Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have undergone a dramatic evolution since their inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical skill.  Early MIS relied heavily on laparoscopy, employing rigid endoscopes and limited dexterity.  This constrained the scope of feasible procedures. Subsequent innovation introduced flexible endoscopes, enhancing visualization and maneuverability within the body cavity.  The development of robotic-assisted surgery marked a significant leap forward, offering surgeons enhanced precision, dexterity, and ergonomic control, leading to improved surgical outcomes in complex procedures.  Concurrent progress in energy sources, such as ultrasonic and laser technologies, facilitated more precise tissue dissection and hemostasis.  Advances in three-dimensional imaging, including high-definition laparoscopy and augmented reality systems, further refined surgical visualization.  These iterative improvements have expanded the applicability of MIS to a wider array of surgical specialties, resulting in reduced patient trauma, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times.  Ongoing research focuses on refining robotic platforms, developing novel imaging modalities, and exploring artificial intelligence applications for improved surgical planning and execution, promising further evolution in the field.
