Organ transplantation, a medical marvel capable of extending and improving lives, is inextricably intertwined with complex ethical dilemmas.  Its history, marked by early experimental procedures and a scarcity of donor organs, has consistently raised profound moral questions.  The initial decades witnessed a struggle to define death, leading to controversies surrounding the procurement of organs and the potential for exploitation.  The subsequent development of sophisticated immunosuppressants and surgical techniques, while enhancing success rates, amplified ethical concerns surrounding allocation fairness, informed consent, and the potential for coercion.  This paper examines the multifaceted ethical landscape of organ transplantation, exploring key issues arising from the historical trajectory of the field.  Specifically, we will analyze the ethical challenges related to donor consent (including living donation and presumed consent models), equitable organ allocation amidst persistent disparities in access, the commercialization of organs and its inherent risks, and the crucial role of transparency and public trust in maintaining the integrity of transplantation systems.  Ultimately, we aim to contribute to ongoing discussions on developing robust and ethically sound frameworks for organ procurement and distribution, ensuring equitable access to this life-saving technology.
