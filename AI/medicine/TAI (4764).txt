Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant and growing public health concern, exhibiting evolving trends influenced by societal shifts and improved diagnostic capabilities. Historically, adolescent mental illness was often overlooked or misattributed to typical teenage angst, leading to delayed or inadequate treatment.  However, increased awareness and research since the latter half of the 20th century have revealed a complex landscape of conditions, including anxiety disorders, depression, substance abuse, and eating disorders, with notable increases in prevalence reported globally.  These trends are linked to factors such as increased academic pressure, social media influence, and broader societal stressors.  Treatment approaches have also undergone significant evolution. While institutionalization was once common, contemporary interventions emphasize evidence-based practices such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacology, tailored to the developmental stage and specific needs of the adolescent.  Early identification and intervention are crucial, with a focus on integrating family-based approaches and promoting resilience-building skills to facilitate long-term mental well-being.  Future research must continue exploring the intersection of biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to these trends and refining treatment modalities for optimal efficacy.
