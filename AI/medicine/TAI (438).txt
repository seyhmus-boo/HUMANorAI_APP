Adolescents experience a heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders, with rising prevalence rates observed globally across various diagnoses.  Anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder, and depressive disorders, encompassing major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder, consistently rank among the most common presentations.  Recent trends indicate a concerning increase in self-harm and suicidal ideation, particularly amongst marginalized youth populations.  Contributing factors are complex and multifaceted, encompassing biological predispositions, environmental stressors (e.g., academic pressure, social media influence, trauma), and societal factors (e.g., access to mental healthcare). Treatment approaches are increasingly incorporating evidence-based modalities, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  However, significant disparities exist in access to care, particularly for underserved communities, highlighting a critical need for improved early intervention strategies, increased mental health literacy within schools and families, and the expansion of accessible and culturally sensitive treatment services.  Future research should focus on understanding the interplay of risk and protective factors, optimizing treatment efficacy across diverse adolescent populations, and addressing systemic barriers to care.
