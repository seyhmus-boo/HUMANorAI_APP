While a purely quantum mechanical description of the relationship between climate change and public health isn't currently feasible, we can explore the conceptual link.  Climate change, driven by increased greenhouse gas concentrations, fundamentally alters macroscopic systems.  From a quantum perspective, these changes represent shifts in the ensemble average of molecular vibrational and rotational energy states within the Earth's atmosphere and oceans.  This alters radiative transfer, impacting temperature distributions at a macroscopic level.

These altered temperature profiles directly influence the proliferation and geographical distribution of disease vectors,  such as mosquitos, impacting the incidence of vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever.  Further, extreme weather events, themselves emergent properties from complex quantum interactions, exacerbate existing health vulnerabilities, causing displacement, injuries, and mental health challenges.  The enhanced energetic states of the atmosphere also influence the severity and frequency of heat waves, posing direct threats to human health, particularly amongst vulnerable populations. Thus, while not directly governed by quantum mechanics, the macroscopic consequences of climate change are ultimately rooted in fundamental shifts in energy distribution at the molecular level.
