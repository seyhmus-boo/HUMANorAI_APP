Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant global public health concern, exhibiting increasing prevalence in recent years.  Trends indicate a rise in anxiety and depression diagnoses, particularly amongst girls, potentially influenced by societal pressures, social media usage, and climate anxiety.  Eating disorders, substance abuse, and self-harm behaviours also remain prevalent, often co-occurring with other conditions.  These trends necessitate a shift in treatment approaches beyond traditional models.

Recent developments emphasize integrated care, incorporating a biopsychosocial approach that considers biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to mental illness.  Digital therapeutics, such as mindfulness apps and online cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), offer accessible and scalable interventions, particularly valuable in addressing barriers to traditional care access.  Pharmacological interventions continue to evolve, with a focus on personalized medicine tailored to individual genetic predispositions and symptom profiles.  Furthermore, research emphasizes the importance of early intervention, promoting proactive screening and preventative strategies in schools and communities to mitigate long-term consequences.  However, persistent challenges include stigma reduction, improved mental health literacy, and equitable access to evidence-based treatments for all adolescents, regardless of socioeconomic background or geographical location.
