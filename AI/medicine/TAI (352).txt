Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant threat to global health security, jeopardizing the effective treatment of bacterial infections.  Driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and environmental contamination, AR has led to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.  This phenomenon exhibits a complex interplay of ecological, social, and economic factors, with consequences extending beyond healthcare systems.  The global implications include increased morbidity and mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, escalating healthcare costs, and diminished effectiveness of medical interventions, particularly in vulnerable populations.  Effective strategies to mitigate AR necessitate a multi-faceted approach. This includes promoting antibiotic stewardship, improving hygiene and sanitation practices, developing rapid diagnostic tools, accelerating the discovery and development of novel antibiotics and alternative therapeutic strategies, and strengthening global surveillance networks for better data collection and epidemiological analysis.  A One Health approach, emphasizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, is crucial to combatting the rise of AR and ensuring the long-term sustainability of antimicrobial therapies.
