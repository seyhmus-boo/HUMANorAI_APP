The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Early research, focusing on chromosomal abnormalities and oncogenes like *ras*, laid the groundwork for identifying specific genetic mutations driving tumorigenesis. This foundational knowledge, however, was limited by technological constraints.  The advent of high-throughput sequencing technologies, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS), has dramatically accelerated the field.  NGS allows for comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, revealing intricate mutational landscapes and informing targeted therapies.

This has led to a paradigm shift from generalized chemotherapy to personalized approaches.  Specific mutations, such as EGFR mutations in lung cancer or BRAF mutations in melanoma, are now routinely targeted with tailored therapies, dramatically improving outcomes for a subset of patients.  However, challenges remain.  Tumour heterogeneity, the presence of multiple subclones with varying genetic profiles within a single tumor, complicates treatment strategies.  Furthermore, the cost and accessibility of comprehensive genomic testing remain significant barriers to widespread implementation of personalized oncology.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations to ensure equitable access to this life-saving technology.
