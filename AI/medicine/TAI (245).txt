Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health.  This abstract explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human well-being.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased morbidity and mortality through heatstroke and exacerbation of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases.  Changes in precipitation patterns, including more frequent and intense extreme weather events (floods, droughts, wildfires), disrupt food security, water sanitation, and infrastructure, leading to malnutrition, infectious disease outbreaks, and displacement, all with significant health consequences.  Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, are projected to expand their geographic range as suitable habitats shift.  Air pollution, worsened by climate change-related events, further contributes to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease.  Indirect effects include mental health impacts from climate-related trauma and displacement, alongside socioeconomic disruptions impacting access to healthcare.  Addressing climate change is therefore not only an environmental imperative but a crucial public health strategy requiring integrated mitigation and adaptation measures.  Future research should prioritize quantifying the specific health burdens attributable to climate change and evaluating the effectiveness of various public health interventions.
