This review examines current trends and treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents, a population experiencing a concerning rise in prevalence.  Anxiety and depression remain the most commonly diagnosed conditions, with increasing rates of self-harm and suicide attempts.  Contributing factors include societal pressures, increased screen time, and the impact of social media on body image and self-esteem.  Treatment approaches are evolving, with a shift towards integrated care models incorporating evidence-based therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).  Pharmacological interventions, while sometimes necessary, are often used in conjunction with psychotherapy, emphasizing a holistic approach.  However, access to timely and appropriate care remains a significant barrier, particularly for marginalized youth.  Future research should focus on early intervention strategies, preventative measures targeting risk factors, and culturally sensitive treatments tailored to diverse adolescent populations.  Addressing the systemic issues contributing to the mental health crisis in adolescents is crucial for improving outcomes and reducing the considerable burden on individuals, families, and healthcare systems.
