Organ transplantation, while offering life-saving benefits, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  Central to these is the allocation of scarce organs, necessitating just and equitable distribution systems.  Utilitarian approaches prioritize maximizing overall benefit, potentially overlooking individual needs or creating disparities based on factors unrelated to medical urgency.  Deontological perspectives emphasize moral duties, such as respecting autonomy by prioritizing patient choice, yet this can conflict with the need for efficient allocation.  

Furthermore, the definition of death, particularly brain death, remains contentious, raising concerns about the precise moment organ retrieval becomes permissible.  Informed consent, crucial for both donors and recipients, can be complex in cases of living donation or when dealing with incapacitated individuals.  The potential for exploitation, coercion, and the commodification of organs necessitates robust regulatory frameworks and oversight.  Practical applications include prioritizing criteria based on medical urgency and need, implementing equitable waiting lists, and employing robust consent procedures.  Addressing these ethical challenges ensures the ethical integrity of this life-saving procedure.
