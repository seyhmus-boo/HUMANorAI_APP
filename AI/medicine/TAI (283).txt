Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and mitigating its impacts.  This presentation explores the complex interplay between environmental shifts and human health outcomes, highlighting the crucial need for collaboration across disciplines.  We examine established links between rising temperatures and increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the expansion of vector-borne diseases due to altered ecological niches, and the impact of extreme weather events on physical and mental well-being.  Furthermore, we address the less-direct, yet equally significant, consequences of climate change, such as food insecurity, water scarcity, and mass displacement, all of which contribute to substantial public health challenges.  By drawing on evidence from epidemiology, environmental science, sociology, and economics, the presentation argues for the integration of climate considerations into public health policy and practice.  It emphasizes the crucial role of interdisciplinary research in developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, fostering resilience, and promoting equitable health outcomes in a changing climate. Finally,  future research directions focusing on vulnerable populations and the development of innovative, interdisciplinary solutions will be discussed.
