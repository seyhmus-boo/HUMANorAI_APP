The evolution of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques reflects a paradigm shift driven by interdisciplinary collaboration.  Early MIS, exemplified by laparoscopy, relied heavily on advancements in optics and instrumentation engineering, enabling visualization and manipulation within confined spaces.  However, the true progress towards sophisticated procedures necessitates contributions from various fields.  Computer science fostered the development of robotic surgery, leveraging advanced image processing and haptic feedback systems for enhanced precision and dexterity.  Materials science provided biocompatible polymers for improved suture materials and degradable implants, minimizing tissue trauma and foreign body reactions.  Medical imaging, through advancements like MRI and CT, revolutionized pre-operative planning and intraoperative guidance, allowing surgeons to navigate complex anatomical structures with greater accuracy.  Furthermore, collaborations with anaesthesiologists refined pain management and patient monitoring, enabling shorter recovery times.  This interdisciplinary approach, encompassing engineering, computer science, materials science, and anesthesiology, continues to drive innovation in MIS, leading to less invasive, safer, and more efficient surgical practices.
