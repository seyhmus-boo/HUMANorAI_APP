Cancer is a complex disease driven by somatic mutations accumulating within cells, leading to uncontrolled proliferation and metastasis.  Recent advances in genomic technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, paving the way for personalized medicine approaches.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows for comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, identifying driver mutations, fusion genes, and copy number alterations, which are crucial for diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection.  This has led to the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors, tailored to specific genetic aberrations.  Furthermore, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis offers minimally invasive monitoring of disease progression and response to therapy.  While challenges remain, including inter- and intratumor heterogeneity and the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive genomic profiling, ongoing research focuses on improving the accuracy and accessibility of NGS, developing novel biomarkers, and integrating multi-omics data to refine personalized cancer treatment strategies.  This includes the exploration of artificial intelligence for predicting treatment response and identifying novel therapeutic targets, ultimately aiming to improve patient outcomes and enhance the precision of cancer care.
