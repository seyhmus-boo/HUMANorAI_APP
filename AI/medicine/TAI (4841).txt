Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, prioritizing smaller incisions and reduced trauma.  This abstract reviews the evolution of MIS techniques, highlighting recent advancements driving improved patient outcomes.  Early laparoscopic procedures, initially limited by two-dimensional visualization and dexterity challenges, have been significantly enhanced by the introduction of robotic surgery.  Robotic platforms offer enhanced precision, dexterity, and three-dimensional visualization, facilitating complex procedures previously considered impossible via traditional MIS.  Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) represents a further evolution, aiming for scarless surgery through natural orifices.  While still facing challenges regarding access and instrument limitations, NOTES showcases ongoing efforts to minimize invasiveness.  Recent developments also encompass advanced imaging techniques, including fluorescence imaging and augmented reality, which improve surgical precision and real-time tissue identification.  Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning offers the potential for personalized surgical planning and intraoperative guidance. These technological advancements continue to refine MIS, promising safer, less invasive, and more effective surgical interventions across a wider range of surgical specialties.  Future research should focus on addressing current limitations and optimizing the integration of these innovative technologies.
