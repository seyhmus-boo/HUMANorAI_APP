While a purely quantum mechanical description of the macroscopic effects of climate change on public health is currently beyond our capabilities, a conceptual framework can be constructed.  Climate change, driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, acts as a perturbation on the complex, coupled system encompassing Earth's climate and human populations.  This perturbation can be viewed through the lens of quantum field theory, where variations in temperature, precipitation, and sea levels represent fluctuating fields influencing the "wave function" of public health outcomes.  Extreme weather events, arising from altered climate patterns, can be considered analogous to high-energy quantum fluctuations, impacting the system's stability and leading to discrete, observable changes like increased mortality rates from heat stroke or displacement due to flooding.  Moreover, the spread of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, can be modeled using probabilistic approaches informed by quantum mechanical principles, accounting for the stochastic nature of pathogen transmission and the dynamic influence of environmental factors like temperature and humidity on vector populations.  Although a precise quantum mechanical calculation of these effects is impractical, the conceptual application of quantum frameworks allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complex, probabilistic interactions governing the relationship between a changing climate and human health. Further research into the application of quantum computational methods may provide advanced tools for modeling and predicting future health risks.
