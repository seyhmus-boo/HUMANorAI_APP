This presentation examines the evolving landscape of adolescent mental health disorders, highlighting significant trends and the inherent challenges in developing and evaluating effective treatments.  We will explore the rising prevalence of anxiety and depression, alongside the increasing complexity of co-occurring disorders, such as substance abuse and eating disorders.  These trends necessitate innovative approaches to treatment, yet rigorous experimental investigation is hampered by several factors.  Ethical considerations surrounding interventions in vulnerable populations, coupled with the difficulties in recruiting and retaining participants in longitudinal studies, present significant obstacles.  Furthermore, the heterogeneity of adolescent presentations, the influence of developmental factors, and the limitations of current diagnostic tools complicate the design of controlled trials and the interpretation of findings.  The presentation will discuss these experimental challenges, specifically focusing on the limitations of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this context and explore alternative methodologies such as pragmatic trials and qualitative research designs that may offer more nuanced understanding of treatment efficacy and patient experience.  Finally, we will suggest avenues for future research to address these methodological hurdles and improve the lives of adolescents struggling with mental health challenges.
