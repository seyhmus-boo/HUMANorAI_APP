This presentation explores the nascent field of applying quantum mechanical principles to understand the complex interplay between climate change and public health. While seemingly disparate, both domains exhibit intricate, interconnected systems amenable to quantum-inspired modelling.  Climate change, with its chaotic weather patterns and ecosystem shifts, can be considered a macroscopic manifestation of underlying quantum-level interactions influencing molecular dynamics and atmospheric chemistry.  Similarly, human health, especially at the cellular and biomolecular level, is profoundly influenced by quantum processes.  We propose that a quantum-mechanical perspective offers novel avenues for investigating the relationship between climate change-induced stressors (e.g., extreme heat, air pollution, infectious disease vectors) and their impact on human health outcomes. This includes exploring quantum entanglement in biological systems as a potential factor in disease susceptibility and resilience to environmental change, and employing quantum computing algorithms to analyze large-scale climate-health datasets and predict future scenarios with increased accuracy.  We will discuss preliminary findings on the application of quantum algorithms to modelling disease transmission patterns exacerbated by climate change and the potential for developing quantum-enhanced diagnostic tools. This novel approach holds significant promise for advancing our understanding and mitigation strategies related to this increasingly critical global challenge.
