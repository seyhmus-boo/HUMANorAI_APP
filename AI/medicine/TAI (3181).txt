Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and development of mental health disorders.  This paper investigates contemporary trends in adolescent mental health, highlighting the escalating prevalence of conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  While advancements in pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments exist, the complexity of these disorders necessitates a multifaceted approach that transcends disciplinary boundaries.  This research emphasizes the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing the multifaceted nature of adolescent mental health challenges. We will explore the synergistic potential of integrating perspectives from psychiatry, psychology, neuroscience, sociology, and education to achieve more effective prevention, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes.  Specifically, we examine the interplay between biological vulnerabilities, environmental stressors, and social determinants of health in shaping adolescent mental well-being.  Furthermore, we analyze the effectiveness of integrated care models that leverage the unique strengths of each discipline to provide comprehensive and holistic support for young people experiencing mental health difficulties.
