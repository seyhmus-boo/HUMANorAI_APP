The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical area of study. Historically, the understanding of this link has evolved from anecdotal observations of extreme weather events impacting health to sophisticated modelling of multifaceted interactions.  Early research primarily focused on direct impacts, such as heat-related mortality and the spread of vector-borne diseases following extreme weather.  However, the field has broadened considerably, acknowledging indirect effects such as malnutrition stemming from agricultural disruptions, mental health consequences of displacement and trauma from climate-related disasters, and exacerbation of pre-existing health inequalities.

Recent research highlights the complex interplay of various climate-change-induced stressors, including air pollution, water scarcity, and food insecurity, all contributing to a growing global burden of disease. This necessitates a transdisciplinary approach incorporating epidemiological studies, climate science, and social sciences to fully comprehend the multifaceted nature of this challenge. While significant progress has been made, further research is crucial to refine predictive models, develop effective mitigation and adaptation strategies, and inform public health policies designed to protect vulnerable populations and ensure climate resilience.  A critical next step involves quantifying the economic burden of climate-related health impacts to drive policy changes at both national and international levels.
