This presentation examines the evolving landscape of mental health disorders in adolescents, tracing historical trends and highlighting contemporary treatment approaches.  Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, often conflated with typical developmental challenges. However, increasing recognition of the prevalence and debilitating impact of conditions like depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders has spurred significant research and intervention development.  We will analyze epidemiological data revealing shifts in the incidence and presentation of these disorders over recent decades, including the potential influence of societal factors such as increased screen time and social media usage.  This analysis will consider both the limitations of existing diagnostic frameworks and the inherent complexities of adolescent development in understanding these trends.  Furthermore, the presentation will explore advancements in treatment modalities, encompassing evidence-based approaches like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and pharmacotherapy.  Finally, we will discuss the critical need for improved access to timely, comprehensive, and culturally sensitive care for adolescents struggling with mental health challenges, emphasizing the crucial role of early intervention and integrated service delivery.
