Organ transplantation represents a significant advancement in modern medicine, offering life-saving and life-enhancing opportunities for patients with end-stage organ failure.  However, the inherent scarcity of organs necessitates complex ethical decision-making processes that extend beyond purely medical considerations. This paper explores the multifaceted ethical challenges embedded within organ transplantation, focusing on three key areas:  the allocation of scarce organs, informed consent and the vulnerabilities of potential donors, and the potential for exploitation and coercion within both living and deceased donation systems.  We analyze existing ethical frameworks and guidelines, examining their strengths and limitations in navigating the complex interplay between individual rights, societal needs, and the equitable distribution of a limited resource.  Furthermore, we investigate emerging technologies, such as 3D-printed organs and xenotransplantation, and their potential impact on the existing ethical landscape.  Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the ethical dilemmas inherent in organ transplantation and to propose avenues for enhancing equitable and ethically sound practices in this crucial area of healthcare.
