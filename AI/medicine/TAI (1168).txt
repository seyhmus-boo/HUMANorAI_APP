Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, undermining modern medicine's capacity to treat bacterial infections. This presentation will explore the multifaceted nature of AR, encompassing its underlying mechanisms, drivers, and far-reaching consequences.  We will discuss the role of selective pressure exerted by antibiotic overuse and misuse in both human and veterinary settings, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices in facilitating the emergence and spread of resistant strains. The global implications of AR are substantial, impacting healthcare systems, economic productivity, and food security.  Increased morbidity and mortality rates associated with untreatable infections represent a major challenge, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with limited healthcare infrastructure. This presentation will also briefly review current strategies to combat AR, highlighting the urgent need for a multi-pronged approach involving stewardship programs, development of novel antimicrobials, accelerated diagnostics, and investment in research and surveillance.  Finally, we will underscore the importance of global collaboration and policy interventions for mitigating the devastating consequences of this critical public health crisis.
