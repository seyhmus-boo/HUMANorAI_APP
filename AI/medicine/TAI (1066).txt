Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, demanding urgent research and innovative solutions. This presentation addresses the considerable experimental challenges hindering effective AR research and mitigation strategies.  Current *in vitro* models often fail to accurately reflect the complex *in vivo* environment, including host immune responses and the intricate interplay between bacterial populations and their microenvironment.  This disconnect limits the translational potential of findings, hampering the development of new antibiotics and therapies.  Furthermore, accurately characterizing the diverse mechanisms of resistance, particularly those involving horizontal gene transfer and biofilm formation, necessitates sophisticated experimental techniques, often unavailable in resource-limited settings.  The ethical considerations surrounding human challenge studies further complicate investigations into the efficacy of novel interventions. Finally, the need for robust, standardized methodologies for monitoring AR prevalence and tracking resistance gene dissemination across diverse geographical locations and clinical settings presents a significant logistical hurdle. Overcoming these experimental challenges requires collaborative efforts focused on developing advanced *in vivo* models, high-throughput screening platforms, and standardized data collection protocols, enabling more accurate predictions and effective global strategies to combat AR.
