Telemedicine has rapidly evolved, transforming modern healthcare delivery and presenting significant opportunities to improve access, efficiency, and patient outcomes.  This presentation explores the pivotal role of interdisciplinary collaboration in maximizing the potential of telemedicine. We will examine how effective implementation necessitates seamless integration across diverse healthcare professions, including physicians, nurses, technicians, pharmacists, and allied health professionals.  The abstract will highlight specific examples of interprofessional teamwork in telemedicine, such as remote patient monitoring involving nurses and technicians, virtual consultations coordinated by physicians and allied health specialists, and pharmacist-led medication reconciliation via telehealth platforms.  Further, we will discuss the crucial role of informaticians and engineers in developing robust and secure telemedicine infrastructure and applications.  Challenges inherent in interprofessional collaboration within telemedicine, including communication barriers, differing professional scopes of practice, and regulatory hurdles, will also be addressed. Finally, we will posit future directions for enhancing interdisciplinary synergy in telemedicine to optimize its impact on patient care and healthcare system sustainability.
