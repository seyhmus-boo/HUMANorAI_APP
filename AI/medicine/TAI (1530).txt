Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the concerning rise in mental health disorders amongst adolescents. Recent epidemiological studies reveal escalating rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm, particularly amongst girls.  Contributing factors are complex and multifaceted, encompassing social media pressures, academic stress, and broader societal changes.  

Treatment approaches are evolving beyond traditional methods.  Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) remain cornerstones, but we are seeing increased integration of mindfulness techniques and digital interventions.  These digital platforms offer accessibility and anonymity, crucial for engaging reluctant young people.  Furthermore, research into the neurobiological underpinnings of these disorders is informing the development of more targeted pharmacological treatments, though caution is warranted regarding long-term effects and potential side effects in developing brains.  Ultimately, a holistic approach encompassing individual therapy, family involvement, and school-based support remains paramount for effective adolescent mental healthcare.
