The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a significant global challenge.  Historically, the impact of climate on health was understood primarily through localized events like heatwaves and infectious disease outbreaks linked to specific weather patterns.  However, anthropogenic climate change introduces a new scale and complexity.  Rising global temperatures exacerbate existing health risks, creating cascading effects across multiple domains.

Direct impacts include increased morbidity and mortality from heat stress, respiratory illnesses aggravated by air pollution exacerbated by wildfires and changing allergen seasons.  Indirect effects are equally substantial, encompassing shifts in vector-borne disease distribution (e.g., malaria, dengue fever), malnutrition due to agricultural disruptions, and mental health consequences from displacement and trauma related to extreme weather events.  Furthermore, climate change undermines access to clean water and sanitation, increasing the risk of waterborne diseases.

The disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations, particularly those in low-income countries and marginalized communities, highlights the strong social determinants of health intertwined with climate vulnerability.  Future research should prioritize the integration of climate change considerations into public health planning,  developing early warning systems for climate-sensitive health risks, and advocating for policy interventions that mitigate both climate change and its health consequences.
