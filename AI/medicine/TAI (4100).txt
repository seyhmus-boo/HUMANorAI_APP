Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat to public health, jeopardizing the effective treatment of bacterial infections. The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture has driven the selection and proliferation of resistant bacterial strains. This phenomenon transcends geographical boundaries, facilitated by the global movement of people, animals, and goods.  The consequences of AR are multifaceted, encompassing increased morbidity and mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, higher healthcare costs, and reduced effectiveness of surgical procedures.  The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens, particularly in Gram-negative bacteria, presents a particularly grave challenge, limiting treatment options and potentially rendering previously treatable infections lethal.  This necessitates a multi-pronged approach involving stringent antimicrobial stewardship programs, the development and deployment of novel antibiotics and alternative therapeutic strategies, improved infection prevention and control measures, and enhanced global surveillance systems to track the spread of resistant organisms.  Failure to address AR effectively will result in a return to a pre-antibiotic era, with devastating implications for global health security and sustainable development.
