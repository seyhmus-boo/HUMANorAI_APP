Antibiotic resistance (AR) presents a significant global challenge demanding an interdisciplinary approach.  Its emergence stems from the evolutionary pressure exerted by widespread antibiotic use in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture.  Microbiology provides the foundational understanding of resistance mechanisms, including mutations, gene transfer, and enzymatic inactivation.  Epidemiology tracks the spread of resistant pathogens across geographical boundaries and within healthcare settings, revealing complex transmission dynamics.  One Health initiatives highlight the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, emphasizing the need for integrated surveillance and control strategies across these sectors.  Furthermore, social sciences play a crucial role in understanding antibiotic usage patterns, influencing public health interventions through education and policy changes.  Economic analyses are vital for assessing the cost-effectiveness of different AR control measures and the societal burden of untreatable infections.  Addressing AR effectively thus requires collaboration between microbiologists, epidemiologists, veterinarians, social scientists, economists, and policymakers, necessitating a holistic and globally coordinated effort.
