Antibiotic resistance (AR), a critical global health threat, arises from the evolution of pathogens exhibiting reduced susceptibility to antimicrobial agents.  Driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, agriculture, and aquaculture, AR undermines the efficacy of existing treatments, leading to prolonged illnesses, increased mortality, and substantial healthcare costs.  The global implications are far-reaching, impacting diverse populations disproportionately and exacerbating existing health inequalities.  The rise of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly concerning in nosocomial settings, poses a significant challenge to healthcare systems worldwide, hindering effective infection control and increasing the burden on intensive care units.  Further complications arise from the limited pipeline of novel antibiotics coupled with the high cost of development, threatening a return to the pre-antibiotic era.  Effective strategies require a multi-pronged approach including stewardship programs to optimize antibiotic use, enhanced surveillance systems to monitor resistance patterns, accelerated research and development of novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapies, and the implementation of stringent infection control measures.  International collaboration and policy interventions are crucial to mitigate the escalating global crisis of antibiotic resistance.
