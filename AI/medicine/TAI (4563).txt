Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the critical issue of antibiotic resistance and the considerable experimental hurdles hindering its mitigation.  The global spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a profound threat to public health, challenging our ability to treat even common infections.  A key experimental challenge lies in identifying novel antibiotic targets. Bacteria evolve rapidly, rendering existing antibiotics ineffective, necessitating the discovery of new mechanisms to disrupt bacterial viability.  High-throughput screening, while promising, suffers from limitations in identifying compounds with suitable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties.  Furthermore, developing effective delivery systems for antibiotics that can penetrate biofilms, where bacteria reside in a protected state, remains a significant obstacle.  The complex interplay of bacterial genetics, environmental factors, and host immunity adds further layers of complexity, making the development of effective countermeasures a multi-faceted challenge requiring innovative experimental approaches and interdisciplinary collaboration.  Ultimately, overcoming these challenges is crucial to preventing a return to a pre-antibiotic era of high mortality from infectious diseases.
