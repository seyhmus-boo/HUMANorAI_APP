Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health.  This lecture explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human wellbeing.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases, with vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever expanding their geographic range and intensity.  Extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, displace populations, disrupt healthcare infrastructure, and increase the risk of malnutrition and waterborne diseases.  Furthermore, air pollution, exacerbated by climate change, contributes to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease.  Indirect effects include mental health impacts arising from displacement, economic hardship, and the psychological stress associated with experiencing climate-related disasters.  Addressing climate change is therefore crucial not only for environmental protection but also for safeguarding global public health and ensuring health equity.  Mitigation and adaptation strategies are essential to minimize these risks and build climate-resilient healthcare systems.
