Cancer's genetic basis underpins the burgeoning field of personalized medicine, aiming to tailor treatments to individual tumor profiles.  Advances in next-generation sequencing have revealed the complex interplay of somatic mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic alterations driving tumorigenesis.  This wealth of genomic data allows for the identification of driver mutations, informing targeted therapies and predictive biomarkers. However, experimental challenges remain significant.  Accurately identifying driver mutations amidst the background of passenger mutations is computationally complex and requires sophisticated bioinformatic analyses.  Furthermore,  intra-tumor heterogeneity presents a substantial obstacle;  a single tumor may harbor multiple clonal populations with diverse genetic profiles, rendering personalized therapies less effective against all subpopulations.  Finally, the development of robust and reliable preclinical models that accurately reflect the complex genomic landscape and microenvironment of human tumors is crucial for translating genomic findings into successful clinical applications. Overcoming these challenges is essential for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer medicine.
