Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding continuous scrutiny and debate. This presentation explores key ethical dilemmas inherent in the process, from donor consent and allocation policies to the potential for exploitation and coercion.  We will examine the tension between the utilitarian principle of maximizing benefit and the deontological emphasis on respecting individual autonomy, particularly concerning living donors.  The presentation critically analyzes current practices regarding informed consent, focusing on the vulnerability of potential donors and the potential for undue influence.  Furthermore, it addresses the persistent disparities in access to transplantation based on socioeconomic status and geographic location, highlighting the need for equitable allocation systems.  Finally, we will discuss emerging ethical challenges presented by novel technologies such as xenotransplantation and 3D-printed organs, emphasizing the importance of proactive ethical frameworks to guide future innovations in this crucial area of healthcare.  The aim is to stimulate discussion and promote thoughtful consideration of ethical principles in the pursuit of equitable and just organ transplantation practices.
