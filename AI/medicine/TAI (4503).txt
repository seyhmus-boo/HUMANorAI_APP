Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window of vulnerability for the onset of mental health disorders.  Historically, the understanding and treatment of adolescent mental illness lagged behind that of adult populations, often dismissed as transient phases of development or attributed to familial issues.  Early approaches were limited, primarily relying on institutionalization or rudimentary therapeutic interventions with little consideration for the developmental nuances of this age group.  However, advancements in neuroscience, developmental psychology, and epidemiological research have revolutionized our comprehension of adolescent mental health.  This paper examines emerging trends in the prevalence and presentation of common adolescent mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  We will explore the evolving landscape of evidence-based treatments, encompassing pharmacological interventions, psychotherapeutic approaches such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and the growing emphasis on integrated care models. Finally, we analyze persistent challenges and gaps in access to appropriate and timely care, highlighting future research directions to improve the mental well-being of adolescents.
