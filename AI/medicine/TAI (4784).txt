Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has undergone a significant evolution since its nascent stages in the 1960s, initially focusing on transmitting medical images for consultation.  Early applications were limited by technological constraints and bandwidth limitations, hindering widespread adoption.  However, advancements in internet infrastructure, mobile technologies, and digital health platforms have spurred a dramatic expansion of telemedicine's scope and accessibility.  Contemporary telemedicine encompasses a wide range of services, including remote monitoring, virtual consultations, telehealth education, and remote diagnostics, significantly impacting healthcare delivery.  This expansion has broadened access to care for geographically isolated populations and individuals with mobility challenges.  While improving patient convenience and reducing healthcare costs, telemedicine also presents challenges related to data security, regulatory frameworks, reimbursement models, and the need for standardized protocols to ensure quality and equitable access.  Future research should focus on addressing these challenges to optimize telemedicine's integration into modern healthcare systems and maximize its potential to enhance global health outcomes.
