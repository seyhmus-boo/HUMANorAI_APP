This presentation explores the intersection of telemedicine and quantum mechanics, not through direct application of quantum technologies to telemedicine itself (which remains nascent), but through a conceptual lens.  While classical computation underpins current telemedicine infrastructure, the inherent limitations of classical information processing, particularly concerning the secure transmission and processing of sensitive patient data, warrant a quantum perspective.  We argue that the security vulnerabilities inherent in classical cryptographic methods used in telemedicine, such as the potential for eavesdropping and data breaches, highlight the need for future-proofing the system against increasingly sophisticated cyberattacks.  The presentation will discuss how the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum-resistant cryptography, offer a potential solution for enhanced security in telemedicine data transmission and storage.  Further, we will briefly explore the potential of quantum computing to enhance diagnostic capabilities and accelerate drug discovery, indirectly impacting the efficacy and efficiency of telemedicine interventions.  By adopting a quantum-informed perspective, we can anticipate and address the evolving challenges of securing and optimizing telemedicine within the broader context of modern healthcare delivery.
