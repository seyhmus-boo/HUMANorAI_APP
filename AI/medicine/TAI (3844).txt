Organ transplantation represents a remarkable advancement in modern medicine, offering life-saving interventions for individuals with end-stage organ failure. However, the inherent scarcity of donor organs necessitates careful ethical consideration across the entire transplantation process. This paper examines the multifaceted ethical challenges embedded within organ procurement, allocation, and transplantation.  We analyze the tension between the utilitarian imperative to maximize organ utilization and the deontological principles of respect for autonomy and bodily integrity, focusing on issues surrounding informed consent from donors (both deceased and living), the equitable distribution of scarce resources amongst deserving recipients, and the potential for coercion or exploitation within donor recruitment strategies.  Furthermore, we explore the ethical implications of emerging technologies, such as xenotransplantation and 3D bioprinting, and their impact on established ethical frameworks.  Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding of the complex ethical landscape of organ transplantation, highlighting critical areas requiring ongoing ethical reflection and policy development to ensure fairness, justice, and the preservation of human dignity within this vital medical field.
