Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding continuous scrutiny in light of technological advancements and societal shifts. This presentation will examine key ethical challenges, focusing on recent developments impacting the allocation and procurement of organs.  We will explore the ongoing debate surrounding equitable access, considering factors such as socioeconomic disparities and geographical limitations in access to transplantation services.  The ethical implications of expanding donor pools, including the use of organs from deceased donors after circulatory determination of death (DCDD), will be critically analysed, addressing concerns around potential coercion and the precise definition of death.  Furthermore, we will address the ethical dilemmas surrounding organ allocation algorithms, particularly regarding the balance between maximizing utilitarian outcomes and upholding principles of justice and fairness.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the emerging ethical considerations surrounding xenotransplantation and the potential for organ manufacturing, highlighting the need for robust ethical frameworks to guide these innovative, yet ethically fraught, advancements.  The aim is to stimulate discussion and promote a deeper understanding of the persistent ethical challenges facing the field of organ transplantation.
