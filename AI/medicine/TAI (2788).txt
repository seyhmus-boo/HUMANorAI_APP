Antibiotic resistance, the ability of microorganisms to withstand antimicrobial agents, poses a significant global threat.  Historically, the discovery of penicillin in the 1920s ushered in an era of effective bacterial infection control. However, the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics since then has driven the selection and evolution of resistant strains. This evolutionary pressure favours bacteria possessing inherent or acquired mechanisms to inactivate, modify, or bypass the action of antibiotics, including enzymatic degradation, efflux pumps, and target site modifications.

The global implications are profound.  Increased resistance translates to higher morbidity and mortality rates, longer hospital stays, and escalated healthcare costs.  The efficacy of treatments for common infections is compromised, potentially rendering previously treatable diseases lethal. This disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries with limited access to new antibiotics and robust infection control measures. The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, capable of resisting multiple antibiotics simultaneously, further exacerbates this challenge, potentially jeopardizing the effectiveness of even last-resort therapies.  Combating antibiotic resistance requires a multi-pronged approach involving responsible antibiotic stewardship, investment in research and development of novel antimicrobials, and enhanced public health initiatives promoting hygiene and infection prevention.
