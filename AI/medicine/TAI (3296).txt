Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting key advancements and their impact on surgical efficacy.  We will explore the transition from early laparoscopic approaches, often limited by two-dimensional visualization and dexterity challenges, to the current era of robotic-assisted surgery and advanced imaging modalities.  The development of smaller instruments, improved energy sources (e.g., ultrasonic shears, bipolar coagulation), and enhanced visualization techniques like 3D laparoscopy and fluorescence imaging will be discussed.  Furthermore, we will examine the practical applications of these advancements across diverse surgical specialties, including general surgery, urology, and gynecology.  Specific examples will include the impact of robotic surgery on complex procedures such as radical prostatectomy and the use of single-port access for enhanced cosmetic results.  The presentation will conclude by considering future trends, such as the potential of artificial intelligence and augmented reality in further refining MIS techniques and broadening their application.
