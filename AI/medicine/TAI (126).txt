Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding ongoing scrutiny. This presentation will explore key ethical challenges inherent in the process, focusing on three primary areas: donor consent and autonomy, equitable allocation of scarce resources, and the potential for exploitation and coercion.  We will examine the nuances of informed consent in the context of living donation, considering the vulnerabilities of potential donors and the need for robust safeguards to protect their autonomy.  Further, we will address the persistent disparities in organ allocation, analysing the impact of socioeconomic factors and geographical location on access to transplantation.  Finally, the presentation will discuss the ethical dilemmas surrounding organ procurement in vulnerable populations, highlighting the risks of commodification and the imperative for equitable and just practices.  By examining these interconnected challenges, we aim to stimulate discussion and promote a more ethically sound approach to organ transplantation, ensuring equitable access and respecting the dignity of both donors and recipients.
