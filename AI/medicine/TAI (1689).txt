Adolescents experience a disproportionately high burden of mental health disorders, with significant implications for their development and future well-being. This presentation will explore recent trends in the prevalence and presentation of common adolescent mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders. We will examine contributing factors such as societal pressures, technological advancements, and biological vulnerabilities, drawing upon epidemiological data and relevant literature.  Furthermore, the presentation will critically analyze current treatment approaches, highlighting both evidence-based interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medication management, and family-based therapies, as well as emerging therapeutic modalities like mindfulness-based interventions and digital mental health platforms.  The efficacy and limitations of these approaches will be discussed, emphasizing the need for integrated, multi-faceted care models that address the unique challenges faced by adolescents.  Finally, the presentation will address gaps in current research and future directions for improving early identification, access to effective care, and ultimately, the mental health outcomes of adolescents.
