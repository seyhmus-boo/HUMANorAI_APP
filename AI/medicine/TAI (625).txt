Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, demanding urgent attention.  This review summarizes the current state of AR, focusing on its multifaceted implications.  The widespread overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, alongside inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, have driven the selection and dissemination of resistant bacteria, compromising treatment efficacy for a range of infections.  This has resulted in increased morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and amplified healthcare costs globally.  The economic burden extends beyond direct healthcare expenditures, impacting productivity and economic development, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.  Furthermore, the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens presents a critical challenge to modern medicine, jeopardizing the treatment of previously treatable infections.  Addressing AR necessitates a multi-pronged approach, encompassing responsible antibiotic stewardship, strengthened infection control measures, development and deployment of novel antimicrobials and diagnostics, and enhanced global surveillance systems.  Continued research into alternative therapeutic strategies, including phage therapy and immunomodulation, is crucial to mitigating this escalating crisis.  Ultimately, a concerted global effort is required to curb AR and safeguard public health.
