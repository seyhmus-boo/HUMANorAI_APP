Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services via information and communication technologies, has significantly reshaped modern healthcare delivery.  Its historical roots trace back to early experiments with radio and television in the mid-20th century, primarily facilitating consultations and transferring medical images.  However, the true proliferation of telemedicine has occurred in recent decades, driven by advancements in internet technology, broadband access, and mobile devices.

This evolution has facilitated a broader range of services, encompassing not only remote consultations and monitoring but also the transmission of medical data, remote diagnostics, and even robotic surgery.  While offering enhanced access to care, particularly for geographically isolated or underserved populations, telemedicine also presents challenges.  Concerns regarding data security, regulatory frameworks, reimbursement models, and the potential for unequal access based on technological literacy remain significant.  Nevertheless,  the increasing integration of telemedicine into mainstream healthcare underscores its transformative potential.  Future research must address the ethical and practical limitations to fully realize its benefits and ensure equitable access for all.
