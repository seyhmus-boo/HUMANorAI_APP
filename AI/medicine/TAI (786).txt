Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using technology, has rapidly evolved from its rudimentary beginnings in the 1960s, initially focused on transmitting medical images.  This presentation examines the transformative role telemedicine plays in contemporary healthcare delivery.  Early applications, hampered by technological limitations and regulatory hurdles, primarily addressed geographic barriers to specialist consultations.  However, advancements in broadband internet, mobile technology, and secure data transfer protocols have dramatically expanded its capabilities.  Now, telemedicine encompasses a wide range of services including remote monitoring, virtual consultations, and telehealth interventions for chronic disease management.  This increased accessibility improves patient outcomes, particularly for underserved populations, and enhances efficiency within healthcare systems by reducing travel time and hospital admissions.  The presentation will analyze the current landscape of telemedicine implementation, highlighting both its successes and challenges.  It will also discuss the ethical and regulatory considerations crucial for its responsible integration into modern healthcare frameworks, emphasizing the need for robust cybersecurity and data privacy measures to ensure patient safety and confidence.  Finally, the abstract will briefly touch upon future directions and potential for artificial intelligence integration within telemedicine platforms.
