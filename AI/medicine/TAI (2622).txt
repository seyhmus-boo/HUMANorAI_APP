Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of bacteria to withstand antimicrobial drugs, poses a significant and escalating global threat.  The rise of AR is driven by factors including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, agricultural practices promoting antibiotic use in livestock, and inadequate infection control measures.  Recent developments highlight the urgency of the situation.  The emergence of extensively drug-resistant (XDR) and pan-drug resistant (PDR) bacteria, capable of resisting multiple classes of antibiotics, is increasingly documented globally, rendering many infections untreatable. This has profound implications for healthcare systems, particularly impacting vulnerable populations and those requiring complex surgical procedures or immunosuppressive therapies.  Furthermore, recent research underscores the contribution of the environment to the dissemination of resistance genes, via horizontal gene transfer mechanisms, highlighting the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health.  Consequently, international collaborations are crucial in developing and implementing strategies encompassing surveillance, responsible antibiotic stewardship, the development of novel antimicrobials, and the exploration of alternative therapies, such as phage therapy and innovative vaccine technologies, to effectively combat the growing challenge of AR.
