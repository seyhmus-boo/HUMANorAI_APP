Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of MIS techniques, highlighting key advancements from early laparoscopic approaches to the sophisticated robotic and image-guided procedures prevalent today.  Early limitations, such as restricted dexterity and limited visual fields, have been progressively overcome through technological innovations.  

Recent developments have focused on enhancing precision and control.  Robotic surgery, with its enhanced articulation and tremor filtration, has significantly expanded the scope of MIS, enabling complex procedures previously relegated to open surgery.  Simultaneously, advancements in 3D imaging, augmented reality, and artificial intelligence are transforming surgical planning and intraoperative decision-making.  These technologies offer real-time anatomical visualization, improved depth perception, and the potential for automated surgical assistance, further minimizing invasiveness and maximizing precision.  The presentation will also briefly address emerging fields such as single-port access and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), exploring their potential and limitations within the evolving landscape of minimally invasive surgical techniques. Finally, ongoing challenges and future directions for MIS will be discussed.
