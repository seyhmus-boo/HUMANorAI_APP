Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma compared to traditional open surgery, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This paper examines the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in its remarkable progress.  From the early adoption of laparoscopy in the mid-20th century to the current proliferation of robotic-assisted and image-guided procedures, advancements have been driven by synergistic interactions between surgical specialties, engineering, materials science, and computer science.  This interdisciplinary approach is evident in the development of sophisticated instrumentation, including smaller, more dexterous instruments and advanced imaging modalities like 3D laparoscopy and fluorescence imaging.  Further, the integration of robotics and artificial intelligence promises to enhance precision, dexterity, and surgical outcomes.  This research will analyze the historical trajectory of MIS, focusing on key technological breakthroughs and their impact on surgical practice.  Furthermore, it will explore the ongoing collaborative efforts across disciplines that are shaping the future of minimally invasive surgery and its potential to address increasingly complex surgical challenges.
