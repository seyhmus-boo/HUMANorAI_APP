Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant and growing global health concern. This presentation will explore historical trends in the prevalence and presentation of these disorders, tracing the evolution of diagnostic criteria and understanding from earlier categorical approaches to contemporary dimensional models.  We will examine shifting societal factors, including increased screen time, social media influence, and academic pressures, which may contribute to rising rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviours.

Further, the presentation will discuss advancements in treatment approaches for adolescent mental health.  While traditional therapies like cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and pharmacotherapy remain cornerstones of care, we will highlight emerging interventions, such as mindfulness-based approaches and digital therapeutics.  The complexities of access to mental healthcare services, particularly for marginalized youth, will also be addressed.  Finally, the presentation will briefly consider the ethical implications of novel treatments and the urgent need for continued research into effective prevention and early intervention strategies to mitigate the long-term impact of adolescent mental health disorders.
