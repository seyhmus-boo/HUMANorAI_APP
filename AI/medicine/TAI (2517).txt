Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a critical area of ongoing debate.  This presentation will explore the complex moral dilemmas inherent in this life-saving procedure, focusing on three key areas:  allocation of scarce resources, informed consent, and the potential for exploitation and coercion.  We will examine the current allocation systems, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in achieving equitable distribution, considering factors such as urgency, need, and waiting time.  The importance of truly informed consent, encompassing cultural sensitivity and the capacity for decision-making, will be emphasized, particularly in scenarios involving vulnerable populations.  Further, we will analyze the ethical implications of organ procurement from living donors, discussing the potential for undue influence and financial incentives.  Practical applications discussed will include strategies for improving transparency in allocation processes, enhancing patient autonomy through improved communication strategies, and implementing robust safeguards to prevent exploitation within living donation frameworks. The ultimate aim is to promote just and ethically sound practices within organ transplantation, ensuring equitable access and safeguarding patient rights.
