Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents a significant challenge to personalized medicine. While genomic sequencing identifies driver mutations informing targeted therapies, translating this knowledge into effective treatments remains problematic.  Challenges lie in accurately identifying clinically actionable mutations amidst passenger variations, particularly in heterogeneous tumour populations exhibiting intratumoral heterogeneity.  Furthermore, the dynamic nature of cancer genomes, including the emergence of resistance mutations during therapy, necessitates longitudinal monitoring and adaptive treatment strategies.  Experimental limitations include the difficulty in establishing robust in vitro and in vivo models that accurately recapitulate the complexity of the human tumour microenvironment and its interactions with the immune system.  Developing patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) or organoids, while offering improved preclinical modelling, remains costly and time-consuming.  Finally, translating promising preclinical findings to clinical trials faces challenges in patient recruitment, trial design, and the interpretation of complex genomic data to ensure patient stratification and outcome prediction accurately reflect therapeutic response.  Overcoming these hurdles is crucial for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer medicine.
