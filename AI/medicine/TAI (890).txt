Research on adolescent mental health disorders highlights escalating prevalence rates across various conditions, including anxiety, depression, and substance abuse.  This necessitates an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and addressing these complex issues.  Effective treatment strategies increasingly recognize the limitations of single-discipline interventions.  Studies emphasize the crucial role of integrating psychological therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), with psychiatric medication management.  Furthermore,  social work's contribution in addressing systemic factors – including family dynamics, peer relationships, and school environments – is vital for holistic care.  Neurobiological research sheds light on underlying mechanisms, informing both pharmacological and psychological interventions.  However, the literature also points to significant gaps in access to care, particularly for marginalized populations.  Future research should prioritize the development of culturally sensitive, integrated models that leverage the strengths of various disciplines to improve early detection, effective treatment, and ultimately, long-term outcomes for adolescents struggling with mental health challenges.  A truly collaborative, interdisciplinary framework is key to maximizing positive impacts.
