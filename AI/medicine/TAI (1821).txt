The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical global challenge.  Historically,  the impacts of climate variability on human health have been observed for centuries, manifest in disease outbreaks linked to fluctuating temperatures and rainfall patterns.  However, anthropogenic climate change, driven primarily by greenhouse gas emissions since the Industrial Revolution, has amplified these effects significantly.  Rising global temperatures contribute to more frequent and intense heatwaves, directly causing heatstroke and exacerbating pre-existing cardiovascular and respiratory conditions.  Changes in precipitation patterns influence the distribution and abundance of disease vectors, such as mosquitoes, leading to increased incidence of vector-borne illnesses like malaria, dengue fever, and Zika virus.  Furthermore, altered weather patterns contribute to more severe natural disasters, including floods and storms, resulting in injuries, displacement, and subsequent mental health challenges.  Climate change also impacts food security and water resources, indirectly affecting nutritional deficiencies and the spread of waterborne diseases.  Understanding this complex interplay necessitates a holistic approach, integrating climate science, epidemiology, and public health interventions to mitigate risks and build resilient communities capable of adapting to a changing climate.
