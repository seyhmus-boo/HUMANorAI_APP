Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant threat to global public health, demanding innovative approaches beyond traditional pharmacological strategies.  While the epidemiological and clinical aspects of AR are extensively studied, a deeper understanding at the molecular level is crucial for developing novel countermeasures. This research explores the potential of quantum mechanics (QM) to provide such insights into the mechanisms driving AR and to inform the design of new antibiotics.  Conventional approaches often rely on classical force fields, insufficiently capturing the intricacies of electron transfer and molecular interactions crucial for antibiotic efficacy and bacterial resistance mechanisms.  This paper argues that QM methods, including density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT), offer superior precision in characterizing the binding affinities of antibiotics to their target proteins, elucidating the subtle structural changes associated with resistance mutations, and predicting the effectiveness of novel antibiotic candidates.  By examining the electronic structure and dynamics of antibiotic-protein complexes at the atomic level, this research aims to illuminate pathways for overcoming AR, thereby contributing to the development of effective strategies to combat this escalating global health crisis.
