Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly antibiotic resistance, poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health, economic stability, and sustainable development.  This review examines the multifaceted nature of antibiotic resistance, exploring its underlying mechanisms, driving factors, and far-reaching consequences.  The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate infection control practices and sanitation, has fueled the selection and proliferation of resistant pathogens. This has led to a marked increase in treatment failures, prolonged hospitalizations, and increased mortality rates globally, particularly impacting low- and middle-income countries with limited healthcare resources.  Beyond direct health implications, AMR threatens to undermine advancements in modern medicine, such as organ transplantation and cancer chemotherapy, while incurring substantial economic burdens on healthcare systems worldwide. This paper will analyze current epidemiological data, explore the complex interplay between environmental factors and AMR emergence, and discuss strategies aimed at mitigating the global crisis, focusing on innovative therapeutic approaches, stewardship initiatives, and the crucial role of international collaborations.
