Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the escalating global crisis of antibiotic resistance and the significant experimental challenges hindering its mitigation.  The development of new antibiotics has stagnated, while resistance mechanisms evolve rapidly, rendering existing treatments ineffective.  This poses a formidable threat to global health, with projections indicating a surge in untreatable infections.

Experimentally, identifying novel antibiotic targets within resistant pathogens presents a major hurdle.  Bacteria exhibit remarkable adaptability, rapidly mutating or acquiring resistance genes through horizontal transfer.  High-throughput screening, while promising, struggles to identify compounds with both potent activity and minimal toxicity.  Furthermore, pre-clinical testing faces complexities in accurately mimicking the in vivo environment, leading to discrepancies between promising in vitro results and disappointing clinical trials.  Finally, the economic realities of antibiotic development, coupled with the long lead times and high failure rates, deter pharmaceutical investment, compounding the experimental challenges and impeding progress towards solutions.  Addressing these issues requires a multi-pronged approach, involving innovative screening methodologies, advanced pre-clinical models, and significant policy changes.
