This presentation explores the nascent field of applying quantum mechanical principles to understand the complex interplay between climate change and public health. While seemingly disparate, the two are intrinsically linked through intricate, emergent systems.  We argue that a quantum-inspired approach, focusing on the inherent uncertainties and non-linearity of climate impacts, offers a novel framework for improved predictive modeling and intervention strategies. Traditional epidemiological models often struggle to capture the cascading effects of climate-related stressors – such as extreme weather events, infectious disease outbreaks, and air pollution – on population health.  By employing concepts like quantum entanglement (representing interconnected environmental and health systems) and quantum superposition (capturing the probabilistic nature of disease emergence), we propose a more nuanced understanding of vulnerability and resilience.  This framework could enhance our ability to anticipate and mitigate the health consequences of climate change, especially in the context of vulnerable populations. We will present preliminary conceptual models and discuss the potential for future research utilizing quantum computing techniques to simulate complex interactions and optimize resource allocation for climate change adaptation and public health preparedness. This interdisciplinary approach bridges the gap between fundamental physics and crucial public health challenges, potentially revolutionizing our understanding and response to the climate crisis.
