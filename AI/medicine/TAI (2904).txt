Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  Central to these is the allocation of scarce organs, demanding just and equitable distribution systems.  First-come, first-served models are demonstrably unfair, potentially disadvantaging individuals based on socioeconomic status or geographic location.  Therefore, many systems prioritize medical urgency and likelihood of post-transplant survival, often employing scoring systems to objectively assess these factors.  However,  this raises questions regarding the value of life, with potential biases against older patients or those with pre-existing conditions.

Further ethical complexities arise regarding informed consent, particularly in cases of deceased donation.  Ensuring families understand the process and genuinely consent without coercion is crucial.  Living donation adds another layer, necessitating stringent safeguards against undue influence and exploitation, emphasizing the autonomy of the potential donor.  The potential for organ trafficking and commercialization further underlines the need for robust regulatory frameworks and international cooperation to uphold ethical standards in organ transplantation practice.
