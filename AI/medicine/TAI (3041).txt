This presentation examines the evolving understanding of nutrition's role in chronic disease prevention.  Historically, nutritional interventions focused primarily on addressing overt deficiencies, such as scurvy and rickets. However, the 20th and 21st centuries have witnessed a paradigm shift, with a growing recognition of the intricate relationship between dietary patterns and the development of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers.  Early epidemiological studies laid the groundwork, highlighting correlations between dietary factors and disease prevalence.  Subsequently, mechanistic research has elucidated the pathways through which macronutrients, micronutrients, and bioactive food components influence inflammation, oxidative stress, and cellular processes implicated in disease pathogenesis.  This presentation will review key historical milestones in nutritional epidemiology and mechanistic research.  Furthermore, it will explore current dietary guidelines and their effectiveness in translating research findings into population-level strategies for chronic disease prevention.  Finally, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities in fostering sustainable dietary changes to mitigate the global burden of chronic disease, including the complexities of social determinants of health and individual dietary preferences.
