Antibiotic resistance, a global health crisis of escalating urgency, threatens the efficacy of life-saving treatments across the spectrum of infectious diseases.  This presentation will trace the historical trajectory of antibiotic resistance, from the initial optimism surrounding the introduction of penicillin in the mid-20th century to the current predicament of widespread microbial resistance.  We will explore the key drivers of resistance, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, inadequate infection control practices, and the dissemination of resistance genes through horizontal gene transfer.  The presentation will further highlight the devastating global implications of this phenomenon, encompassing increased morbidity and mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, and the escalating costs associated with managing resistant infections.  A crucial focus will be on the impact on vulnerable populations, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with limited healthcare resources.  Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss current strategies aimed at combating antibiotic resistance, emphasizing the need for a multi-pronged approach encompassing stewardship programs, research into novel therapeutics, and the development of rapid diagnostic tools.
