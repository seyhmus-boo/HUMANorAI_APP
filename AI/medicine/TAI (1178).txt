Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social change, is marked by a heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders.  This paper examines emerging trends in the prevalence and presentation of mental health disorders among adolescents, focusing on conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  While diagnostic criteria remain relatively consistent, recent research suggests shifts in the manifestation of these disorders, including increased comorbidity and novel presentations linked to technology and social media usage.  Furthermore, this review analyzes the efficacy of current treatment modalities, encompassing both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions.  We explore the limitations of existing approaches, highlighting the need for further research into evidence-based practices tailored to the specific needs of adolescents.  Particular attention is given to the accessibility and affordability of mental healthcare for this vulnerable population, considering disparities based on socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and geographic location.  Ultimately, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of adolescent mental health, informing future research and clinical practice.
