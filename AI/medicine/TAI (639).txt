Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting crucial regulatory pathways controlling cell growth and apoptosis.  The genetic basis of cancer is highly heterogeneous, with diverse driver mutations contributing to tumorigenesis across different cancer types and even within individual tumors.  Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized our understanding of this heterogeneity, enabling comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors. This has facilitated the development of personalized medicine, tailoring treatment strategies based on an individual's unique tumor genetic profile.

Recent advancements include the identification of novel oncogenic drivers and actionable mutations, paving the way for targeted therapies.  Liquid biopsies, utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), offer minimally invasive methods for monitoring disease progression and treatment response.  Furthermore, the integration of genomic data with other omics data, such as transcriptomics and proteomics, allows for a more comprehensive understanding of tumor biology, leading to the development of more effective therapeutic strategies.  Immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors, has also been significantly enhanced by the identification of tumor-specific neoantigens through genomic analysis. These combined approaches are transforming cancer care towards a more precise and individualized approach.
