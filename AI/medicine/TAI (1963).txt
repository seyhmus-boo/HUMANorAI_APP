This presentation explores the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on medical diagnostics, charting its evolution from rudimentary expert systems to sophisticated deep learning models.  Historically, diagnostic accuracy relied heavily on physician expertise and limited technological support. Early attempts at AI integration, such as rule-based systems in the 1970s and 80s, faced limitations due to data scarcity and computational power. However, recent advancements in machine learning, particularly deep learning algorithms applied to large medical datasets (e.g., radiological images, genomic data), have revolutionized the field.  AI algorithms now demonstrate comparable or superior accuracy to human clinicians in detecting various pathologies, including cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and ophthalmological conditions.  This presentation will discuss the specific applications of AI in different diagnostic domains, highlighting both the potential benefits – improved accuracy, speed, and accessibility – and the challenges – algorithmic bias, data privacy concerns, and the need for clinician oversight. We will conclude by examining the ethical and regulatory considerations necessary for the responsible integration of AI into clinical practice and its future trajectory in reshaping healthcare diagnostics.
