Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), prioritizing smaller incisions and reduced trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice.  Early attempts, dating back to the late 19th century with the development of endoscopes, were limited by poor visualization and instrument dexterity.  The 20th century witnessed incremental advancements, including the introduction of laparoscopy in the 1980s, initially for diagnostic purposes but rapidly adopted for therapeutic applications. This period saw the evolution of specialized instrumentation, including articulated endoscopes and energy devices (e.g., lasers, ultrasonic shears), enhancing precision and control.  The subsequent development of robotic-assisted surgery significantly expanded the capabilities of MIS, enabling complex procedures with enhanced dexterity, three-dimensional visualization, and tremor filtration.  Contemporary research focuses on refining existing techniques, such as single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), aiming to further minimize invasiveness.  Future directions include advancements in augmented reality, artificial intelligence-driven surgical planning, and improved materials science to create more biocompatible and durable instruments, ultimately promising safer, less traumatic, and more effective surgical interventions.
