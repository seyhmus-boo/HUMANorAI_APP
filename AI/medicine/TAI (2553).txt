Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have undergone a dramatic evolution since their inception, driven by advancements in instrumentation, imaging, and surgical understanding.  Early MIS procedures, relying primarily on rigid endoscopes and basic instruments, were limited in dexterity and visualization.  The development of flexible endoscopes significantly enhanced access to complex anatomical sites.  Concurrent progress in laparoscopic instrumentation, including the introduction of articulating instruments and energy devices (e.g., bipolar forceps, ultrasonic shears), facilitated more precise and controlled surgical maneuvers.  Advances in 3D and high-definition imaging systems, alongside robotic-assisted surgery, have further improved precision, dexterity, and surgeon ergonomics.  The integration of augmented reality and artificial intelligence holds promise for future advancements, potentially enabling image-guided interventions and personalized surgical planning. This continuous evolution of MIS techniques has resulted in reduced patient trauma, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and improved aesthetic outcomes, establishing MIS as the gold standard for numerous surgical specialties.  Further research will focus on refining existing technologies and exploring novel approaches to expand the scope of MIS.
