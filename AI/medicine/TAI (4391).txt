Adolescents experience a significant rise in mental health disorders, a trend exacerbated by societal factors including increased academic pressure, social media influence, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Anxiety disorders, depression, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) represent prevalent diagnoses, often co-occurring and impacting academic performance, social relationships, and overall well-being.  Treatment approaches are multifaceted and tailored to individual needs.  Evidence-based interventions include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which addresses maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors; medication, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression and anxiety; and family-based therapy, promoting improved communication and support systems.  Early intervention is crucial, emphasizing the importance of accessible and age-appropriate mental healthcare services.  Future research should focus on preventative strategies, particularly addressing the root causes of escalating mental health challenges in this vulnerable population, and on refining treatment protocols for improved efficacy and accessibility.  Further longitudinal studies are needed to monitor long-term effects of interventions and emerging trends in adolescent mental health.
