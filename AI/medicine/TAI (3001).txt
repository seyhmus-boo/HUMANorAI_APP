Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant global health concern, with rising prevalence rates and substantial societal impact. This presentation will examine recent trends in adolescent mental health, focusing on the increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviours.  We will explore contributing factors, such as societal pressures, technological advancements, and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, drawing upon epidemiological data and longitudinal studies.  Furthermore, the presentation will critically evaluate current treatment modalities, including pharmacotherapy and various psychotherapeutic approaches such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT).  A particular emphasis will be placed on the efficacy of integrated care models and the importance of early intervention strategies.  Finally, we will discuss the challenges and future directions in adolescent mental health care, including the need for improved access to services, reduced stigma, and the development of innovative, evidence-based interventions tailored to the specific needs of this vulnerable population.  The presentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of adolescent mental health, highlighting both challenges and promising avenues for future research and practice.
