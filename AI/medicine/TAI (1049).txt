Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, significantly improving patient outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting key advancements and their impact.  Early laparoscopic procedures, pioneered in the late 20th century with the advent of the laparoscope and specialized instruments, were initially limited by technical challenges and a steep learning curve.  The initial focus on cholecystectomy and appendectomy gradually expanded to encompass a wider range of surgical specialties.

This presentation will explore the subsequent development of robotic-assisted surgery, offering enhanced dexterity, precision, and 3D visualization.  We will analyze the transition from 2D laparoscopy to 3D and now potentially 4K imaging, impacting surgical accuracy and training.  Furthermore, advancements in energy sources, such as ultrasonic and bipolar devices, have refined tissue dissection and hemostasis, reducing complications.  The emergence of single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) represents a further push towards minimizing invasiveness.  Finally, we discuss the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning in surgical planning and execution, paving the way for potentially personalized and more effective MIS techniques. The presentation will conclude by briefly considering the future trajectory of MIS, emphasizing the ongoing quest for less invasive approaches and improved patient care.
