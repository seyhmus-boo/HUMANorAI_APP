Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine and public health infrastructure. This presentation will examine the multifaceted nature of AR, highlighting recent developments in its epidemiology, mechanisms, and mitigation strategies.  We will explore the alarming rise of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly in healthcare settings and low- and middle-income countries, where access to effective antibiotics and infection control measures is limited.  Recent genomic sequencing studies have illuminated the complex interplay between environmental contamination, horizontal gene transfer, and the evolution of resistance determinants, providing crucial insights into resistance spread.  The presentation will also discuss advancements in novel antibiotic discovery, including phage therapy, antimicrobial peptides, and the repurposing of existing drugs.  Finally, we will address the urgent need for coordinated global action, emphasizing the importance of stewardship programs, improved diagnostics, strengthened surveillance systems, and innovative public health interventions to curb the trajectory of AR and safeguard human health.  The ultimate goal is to underscore the imperative for interdisciplinary collaboration and resource allocation to effectively combat this global crisis.
