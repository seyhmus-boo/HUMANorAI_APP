Cancer, a complex disease, arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting its normal regulatory processes.  Advances in genomics have revolutionized our understanding of this genetic basis, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies now allow for comprehensive profiling of tumour genomes, identifying driver mutations, fusion genes, and copy number variations unique to individual cancers.  This detailed genetic landscape informs targeted therapies, shifting from broad-spectrum chemotherapy to precisely tailored treatments.

Recent developments include the incorporation of liquid biopsies, utilizing circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) for minimally invasive monitoring of disease progression and treatment response.  Furthermore, immunotherapies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are increasingly being guided by genomic data, predicting which patients are most likely to benefit.  While challenges remain in interpreting complex genomic data and managing treatment-related toxicities, the integration of genomic information promises a future of significantly improved cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment, ultimately leading to more effective and less toxic personalized cancer care.
