Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the concerning trends and evolving treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents.  Recent epidemiological studies reveal a significant rise in anxiety and depression diagnoses, particularly amongst girls.  Contributing factors include increased academic pressure, social media usage, and societal changes.  Furthermore,  eating disorders and self-harm behaviours continue to pose significant challenges.

Treatment approaches are increasingly integrating evidence-based therapies, moving beyond traditional medication-focused models.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) demonstrate efficacy in managing anxiety, depression, and emotional dysregulation.  Mindfulness-based interventions are also gaining traction, particularly for stress reduction.  Technological advancements are further shaping the landscape, with telehealth platforms offering accessible and convenient care, especially crucial for adolescents facing stigma or geographical barriers.  However,  early identification and access to comprehensive, age-appropriate care remain critical challenges requiring ongoing societal investment and research.
