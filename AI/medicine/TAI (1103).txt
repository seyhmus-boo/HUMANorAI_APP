Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, with rising prevalence rates observed across several diagnostic categories, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  Identifying precise causal factors remains challenging, with complex interplay between genetic predispositions, environmental stressors (e.g., social media, academic pressure), and developmental vulnerabilities contributing to heterogeneous presentations.  This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for experimental research, making it difficult to establish robust biomarkers or predict individual treatment response.  Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard, are often hampered by high attrition rates, small sample sizes due to recruitment difficulties, and ethical considerations surrounding interventions in vulnerable populations.  Furthermore,  the dynamic nature of adolescent brain development complicates the assessment of long-term treatment effects and necessitates longitudinal studies, which are costly and time-consuming.  Developing and validating reliable and valid assessment tools specifically tailored to adolescent populations remains crucial to overcome these hurdles. Finally, the translation of promising findings from pre-clinical models to effective clinical interventions continues to pose a considerable translational research challenge. Addressing these experimental limitations is critical for improving early identification, effective treatment, and ultimately, enhancing the mental well-being of adolescents.
