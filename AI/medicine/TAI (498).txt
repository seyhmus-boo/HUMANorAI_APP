Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare diagnostics, demonstrating significant potential to improve accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility.  This review highlights the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in realizing AI's full potential.  Successful AI diagnostic tools necessitate expertise from diverse fields, including medicine, computer science, engineering, and data science.  Medical professionals provide crucial clinical knowledge for data annotation, algorithm validation, and interpretation of AI-generated results, ensuring clinical relevance and mitigating biases.  Computer scientists and engineers develop and refine the AI algorithms, leveraging machine learning techniques for image analysis, natural language processing, and predictive modelling.  Data scientists are essential for data management, cleaning, and feature engineering, addressing challenges of data heterogeneity and ensuring data privacy and security.  The interdisciplinary nature of AI development fosters robust and ethically sound diagnostic systems, mitigating risks associated with algorithmic bias and ensuring responsible AI implementation.  However, challenges remain, including the need for standardized data formats, robust validation studies, and addressing ethical concerns around data privacy and algorithmic transparency.  Further interdisciplinary research is crucial to overcome these hurdles and fully harness the transformative power of AI in healthcare diagnostics.
