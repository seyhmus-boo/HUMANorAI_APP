Organ transplantation, a cornerstone of modern medicine, has dramatically improved patient survival and quality of life for numerous debilitating conditions.  However, its rapid advancement has consistently outpaced the ethical framework governing its practice, leading to persistent and complex dilemmas. Historically, early attempts at transplantation, largely driven by experimental urgency, lacked the robust ethical oversight now considered essential.  The infamous cases of unethical practices, including the exploitation of vulnerable populations and a lack of informed consent, underscore the crucial need for continuous ethical reflection.  This paper examines the multifaceted ethical considerations inherent in organ transplantation, drawing on a historical review to contextualize contemporary challenges. We will explore key issues such as equitable allocation of scarce organs, the definition of death, the potential for coercion and exploitation of donors and their families, and the psychological and social impacts on recipients.  Finally, we will analyze the evolving role of legislation and professional guidelines in attempting to navigate these complexities and propose avenues for strengthening ethical frameworks within the field of organ transplantation.
