Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma and faster recovery.  This presentation explores the evolutionary trajectory of MIS techniques, highlighting the persistent experimental challenges encountered throughout its development.  Early laparoscopic approaches, while groundbreaking, faced limitations in dexterity and visualization, driving innovations in instrumentation and imaging technologies such as robotic surgery and 3D endoscopy.  These advancements, while improving precision and access, introduced new challenges:  the need for sophisticated training programs to master complex robotic systems and the increased cost associated with advanced equipment.  Furthermore, the transition to MIS has spurred research into novel materials for sutures, adhesives, and implants, addressing biocompatibility and long-term efficacy.  The presentation will focus on key experimental hurdles, including the development of bio-inspired tools to enhance dexterity, the investigation of haptic feedback systems to improve tactile sensation during remote surgery, and the evaluation of novel energy sources to minimize collateral tissue damage.  Ultimately, ongoing experimental research is crucial for pushing the boundaries of MIS, enabling safer, more effective, and widely accessible surgical interventions.
