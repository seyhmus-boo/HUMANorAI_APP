While the direct application of quantum mechanics to cancer treatment remains largely theoretical,  understanding cancer at a genetic level profoundly benefits from advances informed by quantum principles.  Specifically,  the immense complexity of gene regulation, involving intricate interactions among numerous molecules and pathways, necessitates computational modelling grounded in quantum chemistry principles.  Accurate modelling of protein structures and their interactions, crucial for drug design, relies on quantum mechanical calculations of electron distributions and molecular orbitals.  

Personalized medicine leverages this understanding by characterizing individual patient tumor genomes through next-generation sequencing. This high-throughput data, encompassing mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic modifications,  is then analysed computationally – algorithms often incorporating quantum-inspired optimization techniques – to identify  patient-specific therapeutic targets and predict treatment responses.  Ultimately, while not directly employing quantum phenomena in treatment itself, the field of personalized oncology relies heavily on computational methods fundamentally rooted in quantum mechanical principles to unravel the intricate genetic basis of cancer and tailor therapies accordingly.
