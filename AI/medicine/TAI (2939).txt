Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding careful scrutiny. This review summarizes key ethical challenges, focusing on issues of justice, autonomy, and beneficence.  Allocation of scarce organs necessitates robust and transparent systems, grappling with competing claims based on medical urgency, waiting time, and societal contribution.  Debate persists regarding the optimal balance between maximizing overall benefit and prioritizing individual need, with concerns raised about disparities in access based on socioeconomic factors and geographical location.  Informed consent, a cornerstone of ethical practice, faces challenges in securing truly voluntary decisions from potential donors and recipients, particularly in scenarios involving vulnerable populations or families facing bereavement.  Furthermore, the commercialization of organs, although largely prohibited, continues to pose a significant ethical threat, exacerbating existing inequalities and undermining the principle of altruistic donation.  Future research should focus on developing more equitable allocation systems, enhancing informed consent processes, and addressing the systemic vulnerabilities that contribute to ethical dilemmas in organ transplantation.  A multidisciplinary approach involving clinicians, ethicists, and policymakers is crucial for navigating this complex landscape and ensuring a just and equitable system.
