Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding urgent attention and innovative solutions. This presentation addresses the critical experimental challenges hindering effective research and development in combating AR.  The inherent complexity of bacterial physiology and the diverse mechanisms underlying resistance create substantial hurdles in identifying novel targets and developing effective countermeasures.  Traditional high-throughput screening methods often fall short due to the intricate interplay between resistance mechanisms and bacterial fitness.  Moreover, the challenge of accurately predicting *in vivo* efficacy from *in vitro* studies remains a significant obstacle.  This necessitates the development of sophisticated experimental models that more realistically reflect the complex host-pathogen interactions, including the impact of the microbiome and the host immune response.  We will discuss the limitations of current experimental approaches, such as the reliance on single-species cultures and the underrepresentation of clinically relevant bacterial strains.  Finally, the presentation will highlight emerging methodologies, including advanced imaging techniques, omics technologies, and sophisticated animal models, that offer potential for overcoming these challenges and driving progress in the fight against AR.
