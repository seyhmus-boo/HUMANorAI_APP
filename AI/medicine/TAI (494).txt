Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  However, the evolution of MIS techniques presents significant experimental challenges. This presentation examines the historical trajectory of MIS, from early laparoscopic approaches to the current landscape of robotic and single-port surgery.  We will highlight the experimental difficulties encountered at each stage, focusing on three key areas:  (1)  Developing and validating new instrumentation, including the challenges of miniaturizing tools while maintaining dexterity and precision; (2)  Improving visualization techniques, addressing limitations imposed by restricted access and the need for enhanced image quality and three-dimensional rendering; and (3)  Establishing robust and reliable simulation models to train surgeons and test novel procedures before clinical implementation.  Specific examples will include the experimental validation of robotic surgical systems and the development of haptic feedback technologies.  The presentation will conclude by discussing future directions and the ongoing need for rigorous experimental approaches to ensure the continued safety and efficacy advancements in MIS.
