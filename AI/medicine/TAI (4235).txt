The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical global challenge.  Historically, the impact of environmental factors on health has been understood since antiquity, with early observations linking water quality to disease outbreaks. However, the scale and complexity of climate change's influence only began receiving focused attention in recent decades.  

The scientific literature now demonstrates a clear causal link, with climate change exacerbating existing health threats and creating new ones.  Rising temperatures contribute to increased heat-related mortality and morbidity, while altered precipitation patterns influence the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever.  Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, result in injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences.  Furthermore, changes in air quality, food security, and water availability all have significant implications for public health outcomes.

While mitigating climate change through emissions reduction is paramount, adaptation strategies are also crucial to protect vulnerable populations. These include strengthening public health infrastructure, improving early warning systems for extreme weather events, and implementing effective vector control measures.  Further research is needed to quantify the full impact of climate change on health and inform effective policy interventions to safeguard human wellbeing in the face of a changing climate.
