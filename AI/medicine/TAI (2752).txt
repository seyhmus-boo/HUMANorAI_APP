Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and multifaceted field demanding ongoing scrutiny.  This lecture addresses key ethical dilemmas inherent in the process, focusing on three critical areas. First, the allocation of scarce organs necessitates a just and equitable system, navigating competing claims based on medical urgency, prognosis, and societal contribution.  Algorithmic approaches, while aiming for objectivity, risk perpetuating existing health inequalities.  Second, the acquisition of organs raises profound questions surrounding informed consent, particularly in cases of living donation, where potential coercion and undue influence must be carefully considered.  Protecting vulnerable populations from exploitation is paramount.  Finally, the commercialization of organs presents significant ethical challenges, fostering organ trafficking and undermining the altruistic principles underlying transplantation.  Addressing these ethical quandaries requires a multidisciplinary approach involving clinicians, ethicists, legal professionals, and policymakers to establish transparent and just frameworks for organ procurement and allocation.
