The genetic basis of cancer is increasingly central to advancements in personalized medicine.  Malignancies arise from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting crucial pathways governing cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.  Identifying these driver mutations, whether in oncogenes (e.g., *KRAS*, *EGFR*) or tumor suppressor genes (e.g., *TP53*, *RB1*), is critical for tailoring treatment.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized this process, enabling comprehensive genomic profiling of tumor samples to pinpoint specific genetic alterations.  This information allows oncologists to select targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for EGFR-mutated lung cancer, maximizing efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity.  Furthermore, understanding the tumor's mutational landscape allows for the prediction of potential responses to immunotherapy, specifically checkpoint inhibitors.  For example, high tumor mutational burden (TMB) is associated with improved response to immune checkpoint blockade.  While challenges remain, including cost, accessibility, and the interpretation of complex genomic data, the integration of genomic information into clinical practice is driving the paradigm shift towards personalized oncology, ultimately improving patient outcomes and quality of life through more precise and effective cancer treatments.
