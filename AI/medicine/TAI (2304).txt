Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and multifaceted global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  This complex issue transcends purely medical boundaries, necessitating collaboration between microbiologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, social scientists, economists, and policymakers.  The review of literature reveals a critical need for improved surveillance systems, encompassing both clinical and environmental monitoring, to track the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens.  Furthermore, the economic implications, particularly concerning healthcare costs and productivity losses, underscore the urgent need for investment in research and development of novel antimicrobials and alternative therapeutic strategies.  Social scientists are crucial in understanding the drivers of AR, including antibiotic usage patterns in both human and veterinary medicine, as well as the influence of socio-economic factors.  Effective policy interventions require integration of scientific evidence with considerations of public health infrastructure, ethical implications, and global equitable access to effective treatment.  Ultimately, a holistic, interdisciplinary strategy is paramount to effectively combat the growing crisis of AR and prevent its devastating global impact.
