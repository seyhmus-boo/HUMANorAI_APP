Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This presentation traces the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting key technological advancements and their impact on surgical approaches.  We will examine the progression from early laparoscopic procedures, characterized by limited dexterity and visualization challenges, to the current era of advanced robotic-assisted surgery and single-port access. The transition to smaller instruments, enhanced imaging modalities (e.g., 3D laparoscopy, fluorescence imaging), and sophisticated energy sources will be discussed.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the evolving role of simulation and virtual reality training in improving surgeon proficiency and patient safety.  We will conclude by exploring future directions in MIS, including the potential of artificial intelligence-guided surgery, augmented reality interfaces, and the continued miniaturization of surgical instruments, emphasizing the ongoing quest for improved precision, safety, and efficacy in minimally invasive surgical interventions.  The impact of these advancements on surgical training paradigms will also be briefly considered.
