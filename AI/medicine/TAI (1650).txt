The escalating global climate crisis presents a multifaceted threat to human well-being, with its impact on public health increasingly recognized as a critical concern.  While traditional epidemiological and sociological approaches dominate the literature, this paper proposes a novel framework for understanding the climate-health nexus through the lens of quantum mechanics.  Although seemingly disparate, the inherent uncertainties and complex interactions characteristic of climate change, mirroring the probabilistic nature of quantum systems, suggest potential benefits from a quantum-informed perspective.  We argue that the intricate web of feedback loops influencing climate-related health outcomes—from extreme weather events impacting infectious disease spread to the cascading effects of air pollution on respiratory health—can be more effectively modeled using quantum computational tools capable of handling high-dimensional, non-linear systems.  Specifically, this research explores the application of quantum algorithms to predict disease outbreaks under varying climate scenarios, analyze the complex interplay between environmental stressors and human susceptibility, and evaluate the effectiveness of public health interventions in a rapidly changing climate.  Our approach ultimately seeks to advance the precision and predictive capacity of climate change risk assessments impacting public health strategies globally.
