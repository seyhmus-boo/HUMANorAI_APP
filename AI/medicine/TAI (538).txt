For decades, cancer treatment relied on broadly targeted therapies.  However, the advent of genomics revolutionized our understanding, revealing the crucial role of genetic mutations in oncogenesis.  Early research identified oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, laying the groundwork for understanding the diverse genetic landscapes of various cancers.  This understanding fueled the development of personalized medicine, a paradigm shift away from "one-size-fits-all" approaches.

Advances in next-generation sequencing now allow for comprehensive genomic profiling of individual tumors, identifying specific mutations driving tumor growth.  This information informs treatment selection, enabling the use of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, specifically designed to counteract these mutations.  Furthermore, immunotherapy, leveraging the patient's own immune system, is increasingly personalized based on the tumor's unique genetic profile and expression of neoantigens. While challenges remain, particularly regarding cost and access, personalized medicine represents a significant advancement in cancer treatment, offering the potential for improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to traditional methods.
