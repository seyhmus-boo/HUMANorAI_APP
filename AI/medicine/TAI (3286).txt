Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, driven by advancements in technology and a growing emphasis on patient-centered care.  Early laparoscopic techniques, pioneered in the late 20th century, were limited by instrumentation and visualization challenges, resulting in longer operative times and a steeper learning curve.  Subsequent innovation focused on improving endoscopic visualization via high-definition cameras and enhanced lighting, alongside the development of smaller, more dexterous instruments.  The introduction of robotic-assisted surgery significantly broadened the scope of MIS, offering surgeons improved dexterity, precision, and three-dimensional visualization.  Further refinements include the integration of advanced imaging modalities, such as intraoperative ultrasound and fluorescence imaging, enabling improved target identification and real-time assessment of tissue viability.  Contemporary trends are focused on single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), aiming to further minimize invasiveness and improve cosmetic outcomes.  However, ongoing challenges include the need for specialized training, the potential for technical difficulties, and the assessment of long-term comparative efficacy against open surgery.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations and expanding the application of MIS across diverse surgical specialties.
