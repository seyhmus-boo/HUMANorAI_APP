Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding a multi-faceted approach, including advancements in drug discovery informed by quantum mechanical (QM) principles.  A review of the field reveals that while classical approaches remain vital, QM simulations offer unique advantages in understanding AR mechanisms at a fundamental level.  QM calculations can elucidate subtle structural changes in bacterial proteins crucial for antibiotic binding, predicting resistance mutations before they emerge clinically.  Density functional theory (DFT) and other QM methods provide insights into the energetics of drug-target interactions, aiding in the design of novel antibiotics with enhanced binding affinities and reduced susceptibility to resistance mechanisms.  However, the computational cost associated with QM methods, particularly for large biomolecular systems, remains a challenge.  Approaches such as QM/MM (quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics) hybrid methods are mitigating this, offering a balance between accuracy and computational feasibility.  Despite these advancements, the complexity of AR necessitates a broader perspective.  QM insights must be integrated with experimental data and epidemiological studies for a holistic understanding and effective combatting of this global health crisis. Further development and application of advanced QM techniques hold immense promise for accelerating the discovery of novel antibiotics and strategies to overcome AR.
