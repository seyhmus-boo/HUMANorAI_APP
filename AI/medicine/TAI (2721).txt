Climate change significantly impacts public health, manifesting through multifaceted and increasingly complex pathways.  Recent research highlights a strengthening link between extreme weather events – intensified by climate change – and heightened morbidity and mortality. Heatwaves, for instance, are causing a surge in heatstroke and cardiovascular illnesses, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to waterborne disease outbreaks and food insecurity, while rising sea levels exacerbate displacement and mental health challenges.  Vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever are expanding their geographic ranges due to altered temperatures and precipitation, posing significant threats to global health security.

Recent developments emphasize the synergistic effects of climate change with pre-existing health inequalities.  Disadvantaged communities often bear a disproportionate burden of climate-related health impacts due to limited access to healthcare and resources.  Furthermore, air pollution exacerbated by fossil fuel combustion contributes to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular disease, highlighting the interwoven nature of climate change and air quality.  Interdisciplinary research is increasingly focusing on the development of climate-resilient health systems and the integration of climate change considerations into public health policy, underscoring the urgent need for proactive and comprehensive mitigation and adaptation strategies.
