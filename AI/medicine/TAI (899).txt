Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, yet their evolution from open surgery remains largely described through a classical mechanical lens. This abstract proposes a novel perspective, framing the evolution of MIS through the principles of quantum mechanics.  While not directly applicable to macroscopic surgical instruments, quantum concepts provide a framework for understanding the underlying principles of information processing and control crucial to MIS advancements. The transition from open surgery's deterministic, macroscopic approach to MIS's probabilistic, microscopic manipulation mirrors the shift from classical to quantum mechanics.  Miniaturization of instruments, analogous to quantum confinement, necessitates sophisticated control systems leveraging feedback mechanisms and predictive modelingâ€”a quantum-like information processing strategy.  The increasing reliance on image-guided navigation and robotic assistance demonstrates the need for accurate and near real-time information transfer, akin to entanglement in quantum systems.  Furthermore, the development of advanced energy sources for minimally invasive procedures, such as laser ablation, reflects the utilization of finely controlled energy packets reminiscent of photon manipulation in quantum optics.  Future research should explore applying quantum-inspired algorithms for optimizing surgical planning and execution, potentially leading to improved precision, reduced invasiveness, and enhanced patient outcomes.  This quantum-informed approach promises new insights into the ongoing evolution of MIS techniques.
