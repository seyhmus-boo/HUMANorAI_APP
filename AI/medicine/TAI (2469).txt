Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting normal cellular processes and ultimately leading to uncontrolled proliferation and metastasis.  Advances in genomics have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, revealing diverse driver mutations across different cancer types. This knowledge underpins the burgeoning field of personalized medicine, which aims to tailor cancer treatment based on an individual's unique tumor genome.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allow comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, identifying specific mutations, copy number variations, and fusion genes driving tumorigenesis. This information facilitates the selection of targeted therapies, such as kinase inhibitors or immunotherapy, maximizing efficacy while minimizing adverse effects. Furthermore,  analysis of germline mutations identifies individuals at increased cancer risk, enabling preventive strategies.  Ongoing research focuses on integrating multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) to build comprehensive molecular profiles predicting treatment response and prognosis, ultimately refining personalized cancer care and improving patient outcomes. However, challenges remain in interpreting complex genomic data, developing cost-effective strategies for widespread implementation, and addressing the ethical considerations surrounding personalized cancer care.
