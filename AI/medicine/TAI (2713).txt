Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting fundamental cellular processes such as growth control and apoptosis.  Advances in genomics have unveiled the complex genetic landscape underlying diverse cancers, revealing driver mutations, passenger mutations, and the intricate interplay of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. This understanding forms the cornerstone of personalized medicine in oncology.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies facilitate comprehensive genomic profiling, identifying unique mutational signatures within individual tumors.  This enables the selection of targeted therapies, tailored to the specific genetic aberrations driving a patient's cancer.  Furthermore,  liquid biopsies, utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), offer minimally invasive methods for monitoring disease progression and treatment response, facilitating real-time adjustments to therapeutic strategies. While challenges remain, including the identification of optimal biomarkers and managing treatment-related toxicities, the integration of genomic information into clinical practice promises to significantly improve cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment efficacy, paving the way for truly personalized cancer care.
