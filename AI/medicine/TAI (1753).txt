Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This research paper examines the complex and evolving relationship between climate change and a range of health outcomes, moving beyond a simplistic cause-and-effect model to explore nuanced interactions and cascading impacts. We analyze the direct effects of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, on morbidity and mortality, alongside indirect consequences including the altered distribution of infectious diseases, malnutrition, and mental health impacts.  The paper further considers the mediating role of social determinants of health, emphasizing the disproportionate burden faced by vulnerable populations.  Our analysis incorporates existing epidemiological studies, climate projections, and social vulnerability indices to assess the current and projected health impacts across various geographical contexts.  Ultimately, we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the climate-health nexus, highlighting critical knowledge gaps and informing the development of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect public health in the face of a changing climate.
