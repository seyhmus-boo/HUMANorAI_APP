Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health. This research paper examines the complex and evolving relationship between a changing climate and human health outcomes.  We analyze the diverse pathways through which climate change impacts health, encompassing direct effects such as heat-related mortality and the increased incidence of vector-borne diseases, and indirect effects including malnutrition, mental health issues arising from displacement and trauma, and the exacerbation of existing health inequalities.  The paper reviews existing literature on the projected impacts of climate change across different regions and populations, highlighting disparities in vulnerability and adaptive capacity.  Furthermore, we explore the effectiveness of current public health interventions designed to mitigate climate change-related health risks, considering both preventative strategies and adaptation measures.  Finally, we discuss the need for integrated, multi-sectoral approaches that address the underlying drivers of climate change while simultaneously strengthening health systems' resilience to its impacts.  This analysis underscores the urgency of proactive and comprehensive strategies to safeguard public health in the face of a rapidly changing climate.
