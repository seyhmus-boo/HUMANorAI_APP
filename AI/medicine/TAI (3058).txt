The genetic underpinnings of cancer are increasingly understood, fueling significant advances in personalized medicine.  Next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized cancer diagnostics, enabling comprehensive genomic profiling of tumor samples.  This allows for the identification of driver mutations, specific genetic alterations responsible for initiating and driving tumor growth.  This information is crucial in selecting targeted therapies, matching patients to drugs that specifically inhibit the activity of the identified oncogenic proteins.  Recent developments in immunotherapy, particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors, are also highly dependent on genomic information.  Understanding the tumor's mutational landscape, including neoantigen presentation, allows clinicians to predict a patient's response to immunotherapy.  Furthermore, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis offers a minimally invasive approach for monitoring disease progression, detecting residual disease, and assessing treatment response in real-time.  While challenges remain, including the complexity of interpreting diverse genomic data and the potential for drug resistance, the integration of genomic information into clinical practice marks a paradigm shift towards more precise, effective, and individualized cancer treatment.  Ongoing research focuses on refining predictive biomarkers, developing novel therapies targeting specific genomic alterations, and improving the accessibility of genomic testing.
