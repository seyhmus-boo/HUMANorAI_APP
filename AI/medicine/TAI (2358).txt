Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, jeopardizing the effective treatment of bacterial infections.  The widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture has driven the selection and dissemination of resistant genes, leading to the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens.  This phenomenon impacts healthcare systems globally, increasing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  The economic burden encompasses direct costs associated with prolonged hospital stays, intensive care, and novel therapeutic development, as well as indirect costs from lost productivity and reduced economic output.  The impact extends beyond human health, affecting animal health and food security.  Strategies to combat AR require a multifaceted approach encompassing stewardship initiatives to optimize antibiotic use, development of novel antimicrobials and alternative therapies (e.g., phage therapy), improved diagnostics, and enhanced surveillance systems.  International collaboration and policy changes are crucial to implementing effective global strategies to mitigate the growing threat of AR and preserve the efficacy of existing antibiotics.  Failure to address this crisis will have profound and irreversible consequences on global health and societal well-being.
