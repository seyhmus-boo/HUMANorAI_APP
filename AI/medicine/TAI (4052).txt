Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, necessitating an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.  This abstract highlights the complex interplay between environmental shifts and human health outcomes, drawing on evidence from climatology, epidemiology, sociology, and economics.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Altered precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, while extreme weather events increase the risk of injuries, displacement, and mental health issues.  Furthermore, changes in air quality and food security, driven by climate change, exacerbate respiratory diseases and malnutrition.  Effective responses require integrating climate modeling with epidemiological surveillance to predict and manage health risks.  Socioeconomic factors, including access to healthcare and resources, significantly mediate the impact of climate change on health disparities.  A robust, interdisciplinary framework encompassing these factors is essential for developing effective policies and interventions to protect public health in the face of a changing climate.  Future research should prioritize collaborative efforts to better understand and address the complex, interconnected challenges presented by this global crisis.
