Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  The scarcity of organs necessitates a system for allocation, raising questions of distributive justice akin to the allocation of limited resources like vaccines or affordable housing.  Prioritizing patients based on medical urgency versus societal contribution resembles the trolley problem, forcing difficult choices between saving many lives with a single organ or maximizing the life-years gained.

The concept of informed consent becomes complex, particularly with living donors, who may face pressure from family or feel obligated due to kinship. This resembles a coercive bargaining scenario, where genuine autonomy may be compromised.  Furthermore, the potential for exploitation, particularly in vulnerable populations, is a significant concern, analogous to the historical exploitation of marginalized groups in medical research.  Finally, the definition of death itself – brain death versus circulatory death – remains a contested area with profound implications for organ procurement, mirroring the ongoing debates surrounding the definition of personhood. These complexities underscore the need for rigorous ethical frameworks to guide organ allocation and donor protection.
