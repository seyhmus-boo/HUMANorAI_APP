Adolescents experience a heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders, with trends indicating a concerning increase in prevalence across various conditions.  Anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder, remain highly prevalent, exacerbated by factors such as academic pressure and social media use.  Similarly, depressive disorders are showing a persistent upward trajectory, with a notable rise in diagnoses of major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder.  Recent research highlights the increasing recognition and diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorders such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in adolescence, potentially reflecting improved diagnostic tools and awareness.  Treatment approaches are evolving, moving beyond traditional methods.  Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) remains a cornerstone, but newer techniques like mindfulness-based interventions and digital therapeutics are gaining traction, offering accessible and potentially more engaging modalities, particularly for digitally native adolescents.  Furthermore, integrated care models, encompassing mental health services within broader healthcare settings, are emerging as a promising strategy for improved early intervention and comprehensive support, addressing the complex interplay between physical and mental well-being during this critical developmental period.  However, persistent challenges include disparities in access to quality mental healthcare, particularly for underserved populations.
