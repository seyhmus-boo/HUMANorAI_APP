Adolescents experience a disproportionately high prevalence of mental health disorders (MHDs), including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, with significant implications for their well-being and future development.  Recent trends reveal a concerning increase in MHD prevalence, potentially linked to societal factors like increased screen time, social media pressures, and the impact of global events.  Effective treatment requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating expertise from psychiatry, psychology, social work, and neuroscience.  Biological interventions such as pharmacotherapy often necessitate concurrent psychological therapies, like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) or dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), which address underlying cognitive distortions and behavioral patterns.  Social work plays a crucial role in navigating social determinants of health, including family dynamics and access to resources.  Neuroscientific advancements are enhancing our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of MHDs in adolescents, informing the development of more targeted and effective interventions.  Future research should focus on strengthening interdisciplinary collaboration, improving early identification and intervention strategies, and addressing health inequities to improve mental health outcomes for adolescents.
