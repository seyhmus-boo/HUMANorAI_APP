The genetic basis of cancer has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  However, translating genomic discoveries into effective, targeted therapies remains challenging.  Identifying driver mutations amidst the vast landscape of passenger mutations in individual tumors is a significant hurdle.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, while powerful, present bioinformatic challenges in data analysis and interpretation, particularly concerning low-frequency mutations and heterogeneous tumor populations.  Furthermore,  the functional validation of candidate driver mutations necessitates complex in vitro and in vivo models accurately reflecting the tumor microenvironment and its intercellular interactions, often proving difficult to replicate.  Predicting therapeutic response based solely on genomic profiling also faces limitations; the complexity of signaling pathways and the presence of compensatory mechanisms confound simple genotype-phenotype correlations.  Finally, the high cost and accessibility limitations of comprehensive genomic profiling restrict the widespread implementation of personalized cancer medicine, particularly in resource-constrained settings.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is crucial to fully realizing the promise of personalized cancer treatment.
