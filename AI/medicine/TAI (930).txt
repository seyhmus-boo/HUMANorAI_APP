Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, but its evolution presents significant experimental challenges. Early MIS techniques, primarily laparoscopy, faced limitations in dexterity and visualization, hindering complex procedures.  Experimental studies focused on improving instrumentation, such as articulating endoscopes and robotic systems,  faced hurdles in replicating the complex biomechanical interactions of tissue during surgery.  Validation of novel instruments and techniques requires robust preclinical models that accurately mimic human tissue properties and surgical environments, a challenge exacerbated by the need for ex vivo and in vivo studies. Assessing the long-term effects of MIS, including scarring and adhesion formation, necessitates sophisticated imaging techniques and prolonged follow-up, imposing logistical and resource constraints. Furthermore,  standardizing evaluation metrics for comparing different MIS techniques remains problematic, hindering objective comparisons across studies.  Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for accelerating the development of safer, more effective, and widely accessible MIS techniques, requiring a multidisciplinary approach integrating engineering, surgical expertise, and advanced imaging modalities.  Future research should prioritize the development of standardized experimental protocols and improved preclinical models to accelerate translation of MIS innovations into clinical practice.
