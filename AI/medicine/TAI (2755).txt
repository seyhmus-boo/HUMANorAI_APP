This review examines recent trends in mental health disorders among adolescents, highlighting the escalating prevalence of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviours.  Data consistently demonstrate a concerning rise in these conditions, influenced by factors including social media usage, academic pressures, and societal changes.  Treatment approaches remain diverse, encompassing pharmacological interventions such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).  However, access to evidence-based care remains a significant challenge, particularly for underserved populations.  While SSRIs demonstrate efficacy for certain disorders, their long-term effects and potential side effects warrant careful monitoring. CBT, conversely, offers a valuable non-pharmacological approach fostering resilience and coping mechanisms.  Emerging trends in digital mental health interventions show promise in improving accessibility and reducing stigma, but their effectiveness and ethical considerations require further investigation.  This review concludes by emphasizing the urgent need for integrated, multidisciplinary care models that address the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to adolescent mental health disorders. Further research is needed to optimize treatment strategies and ensure equitable access to care for all adolescents.
