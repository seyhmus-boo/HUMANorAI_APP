Organ transplantation, while offering a life-saving intervention, presents complex ethical dilemmas.  The scarcity of donor organs necessitates a system for equitable allocation, raising questions of distributive justice.  Criteria based solely on medical urgency may disadvantage certain groups, necessitating consideration of factors like age, lifestyle choices, and social status, potentially leading to biased outcomes.  Furthermore, the definition of death, particularly brain death, remains contested, highlighting the need for clear and consistently applied criteria to ensure the ethical procurement of organs.

Informed consent from donors and their families is paramount, requiring sensitivity and transparency concerning the donation process.  The potential for coercion, especially in vulnerable populations, necessitates robust safeguards.  Commercialization of organs, while explicitly prohibited in many jurisdictions, presents a significant ethical challenge, creating a market susceptible to exploitation and exacerbating existing inequalities.  Practical applications of ethical frameworks include establishing independent ethics committees to oversee allocation decisions, developing robust consent procedures, and enacting legislation to prevent organ trafficking, thereby ensuring fairness and upholding the dignity of both donors and recipients.
