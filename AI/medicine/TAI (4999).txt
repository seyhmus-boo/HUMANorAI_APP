Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIS) represent a paradigm shift in surgical practice, prioritizing smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster patient recovery compared to traditional open surgery.  This paper explores the significant evolution of MIS techniques, tracing their development from rudimentary beginnings to the sophisticated technologies employed today. The historical roots of MIS can be found in early endoscopic procedures, such as the initial explorations of the body's cavities using rudimentary endoscopes in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  These early attempts, while limited in scope and precision, laid the groundwork for future advancements.  The latter half of the 20th century witnessed the pivotal development of laparoscopy, fueled by technological breakthroughs in fiber optics and imaging. This marked a turning point, enabling surgeons to perform complex procedures with enhanced visualization and dexterity through small incisions.  Subsequently, the field has witnessed the integration of robotics, advanced imaging modalities, and specialized instruments, leading to refined techniques like robotic-assisted surgery and single-port access surgery. This paper will analyze the key technological advancements driving this evolution, alongside their impact on surgical outcomes, patient experience, and the future trajectory of minimally invasive surgery.
