Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to fully understand and address its complex impacts.  This research paper examines the intricate relationship between climate change and public health outcomes, highlighting the critical interconnectedness across various disciplines.  While traditionally viewed through the lens of environmental science and epidemiology, a comprehensive understanding necessitates integrating perspectives from sociology, economics, political science, and psychology, among others.  The direct impacts of climate change, such as heat-related illnesses, the spread of infectious diseases, and the exacerbation of respiratory conditions, will be explored.  Furthermore, the paper investigates indirect consequences, including the effects on mental health stemming from climate-related disasters and displacement, as well as the socioeconomic disparities amplified by climate change vulnerabilities. By drawing on diverse theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence, this study aims to synthesize existing knowledge and underscore the urgent need for integrated, interdisciplinary strategies to mitigate the health risks associated with a changing climate. This integrated approach is crucial for developing effective public health interventions and policies that effectively address the complex challenges ahead.
