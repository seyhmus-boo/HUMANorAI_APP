Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents a significant challenge to personalized medicine. While genomic sequencing identifies driver mutations underpinning individual tumorigenesis, translating this knowledge into effective therapies remains complex.  Experimental challenges include accurately identifying clinically relevant mutations amidst the vast number of passenger mutations, and differentiating driver mutations' impact across diverse cellular contexts.  Furthermore, functional validation of candidate driver mutations often requires laborious in vitro and in vivo models, which may not perfectly replicate the intricate tumor microenvironment.  The dynamic nature of cancer, with its capacity for clonal evolution and development of drug resistance, adds another layer of complexity.  Predicting response to targeted therapies based solely on genomic data faces limitations due to the interplay between genetic alterations and other factors like epigenetic modifications and immune system responses. Overcoming these challenges necessitates the development of more sophisticated experimental models that capture the complexity of cancer, along with the integration of multi-omics data and advanced computational modeling to predict therapeutic outcomes.
