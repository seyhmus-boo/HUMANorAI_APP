Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIST) have undergone a dramatic evolution since their inception, significantly impacting patient outcomes and healthcare delivery.  Early MIST relied primarily on laparoscopy, limited by two-dimensional visualization and instrument dexterity.  This review summarizes key advancements, including the transition to robotic-assisted surgery, offering enhanced precision, 3D visualization, and improved ergonomics for surgeons.  Simultaneously, advancements in imaging technologies, such as high-definition endoscopes and fluorescence imaging, have enhanced intraoperative navigation and tissue differentiation.  The development of smaller, more sophisticated instruments has expanded the applicability of MIST to previously challenging procedures.  Furthermore, the integration of augmented reality and artificial intelligence holds immense promise for future refinements, potentially leading to personalized surgical approaches and improved training modalities. While challenges remain, such as the learning curve associated with advanced techniques and the accessibility of expensive technologies, the evolution of MIST continues to redefine surgical practice, driving improvements in patient recovery, reduced hospital stays, and enhanced overall quality of life.  Further research is needed to optimize these techniques and ensure equitable access.
