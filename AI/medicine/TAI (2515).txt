Mental health disorders in adolescents are a growing global concern, exhibiting complex trends influenced by societal, environmental, and biological factors.  Recent data reveals a concerning increase in the prevalence of anxiety and depression, particularly amongst girls, alongside a rise in self-harm and suicidal ideation.  While traditional risk factors like family history and adverse childhood experiences remain significant, the impact of social media use, academic pressure, and climate anxiety is increasingly recognized.  Treatment approaches are evolving, moving beyond solely pharmacological interventions.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) continue to demonstrate efficacy, while promising advancements are seen in utilizing digital mental health platforms for accessible and scalable interventions.  These platforms leverage technologies such as mobile apps and telehealth, offering personalized support and overcoming geographical barriers.  However, challenges remain in early identification, timely access to care, and the need for culturally sensitive and tailored treatments that address the unique developmental needs of adolescents.  Future research should focus on refining these digital interventions, understanding the interplay of multiple risk factors, and developing effective preventative strategies.
