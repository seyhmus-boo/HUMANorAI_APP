Significant progress has been made in elucidating the genetic basis of cancer, fueling the rise of personalized medicine.  However, translating this knowledge into effective clinical practice remains challenging.  While genomic sequencing allows identification of driver mutations and specific tumor profiles, experimental hurdles persist.  Firstly, the sheer complexity of cancer genomes, featuring numerous somatic mutations and heterogeneous subclones, complicates the identification of truly causative mutations and predicting therapeutic response.  Secondly, preclinical models, including cell lines and xenografts, often inadequately reflect the intricacies of the human tumor microenvironment, limiting the translatability of experimental findings.  Thirdly, the ethical considerations surrounding germline testing and the potential for incidental findings require careful navigation.  Finally, the high cost of genomic sequencing and the need for specialized bioinformatics expertise pose significant barriers to widespread implementation.  Addressing these experimental limitations through improved modelling techniques, refined bioinformatic analysis, and cost-effective sequencing strategies is crucial for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer medicine.  Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated predictive models incorporating both genetic and non-genetic factors to maximize the clinical impact of genomic insights.
