Historically, adolescent mental health disorders were often overlooked, attributed to typical teenage angst or dismissed due to a lack of sophisticated diagnostic tools.  However, recent decades have witnessed a surge in both identified cases and research into these conditions.  Trends indicate increasing prevalence of anxiety and depression, alongside a rise in self-harm and suicide attempts, particularly amongst girls.  Contributing factors are complex and multifactorial, encompassing societal pressures, genetic predisposition, and environmental stressors like social media and academic demands.

Treatment approaches have evolved alongside these trends, moving beyond solely pharmacological interventions.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) have proven effective in managing anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors.  Family-based therapies recognize the crucial role of familial dynamics in adolescent mental health.  Early intervention is crucial, aiming to disrupt negative cycles and promote resilience.  However, access to appropriate mental healthcare remains a significant barrier, highlighting the need for increased funding and resources dedicated to adolescent mental health services.
