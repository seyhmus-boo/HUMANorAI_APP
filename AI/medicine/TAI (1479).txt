While a direct quantum mechanical description of climate change's impact on public health is currently beyond our capabilities, we can explore the conceptual link. Climate change, driven by increased greenhouse gas concentrations, fundamentally alters macroscopic systems – the Earth's climate – impacting the energetic landscape experienced by biological systems.  This alteration isn't directly governed by quantum mechanics, but the underlying physical processes are based on interactions at the atomic and molecular level,  from the absorption of photons by greenhouse gases to the resulting changes in atmospheric dynamics.

These macroscopic changes induce shifts in disease vectors' geographical ranges and lifecycles, affecting the probabilities of infectious disease transmission.  Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns alter the energetic landscape influencing the survival and spread of pathogens, thereby influencing public health outcomes.  Further, increased extreme weather events, a direct consequence of climate change, pose direct threats to human health, demonstrating a clear, albeit indirect, link between quantum phenomena and observable consequences for population health.  The complexity of this relationship mandates an interdisciplinary approach that integrates climate science, epidemiology, and even quantum chemistry to truly grasp the magnitude of this challenge.
