Organ transplantation, while a life-saving medical marvel, presents complex ethical dilemmas.  A central concern revolves around the allocation of scarce organs.  Justice demands equitable distribution, yet various systems – points-based, utilitarian, or first-come-first-served – face criticism for inherent biases favouring certain demographics or overlooking factors like social worth.  Furthermore, the definition of "death" for organ procurement remains a contentious issue, sparking debates surrounding brain death versus cardiopulmonary death criteria and the potential for coercion.

Another crucial ethical aspect involves informed consent.  Patients must be fully apprised of the risks and benefits of both donation and transplantation, and their autonomy respected, particularly concerning living donation.  Financial incentives, while potentially increasing organ availability, introduce the problematic possibility of exploitation, especially in vulnerable populations.  Finally, the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation – using animal organs – raises ethical questions concerning animal welfare and the risk of zoonotic disease transmission. These considerations necessitate rigorous ethical frameworks guiding both policy and clinical practice.
