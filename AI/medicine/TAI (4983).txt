Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This presentation explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human health outcomes, highlighting key interdisciplinary links.  We will examine the direct impacts of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, on morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the need for collaboration between climatologists, epidemiologists, and emergency management specialists.  Further, we will delve into the indirect consequences, including the spread of infectious diseases through altered vector distributions (requiring expertise from ecologists and entomologists) and the impact on mental health due to displacement and resource scarcity (necessitating contributions from psychologists and social scientists).  The presentation will also discuss the critical role of environmental justice in addressing climate-related health disparities, demanding a collaborative effort from public health professionals, urban planners, and policymakers.  Finally, we will outline crucial areas for future interdisciplinary research and highlight the urgent need for integrated strategies to protect public health in the face of a changing climate.
