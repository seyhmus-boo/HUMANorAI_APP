Cancer is a complex disease driven by somatic mutations accumulating within cells, leading to uncontrolled proliferation and metastasis.  Advances in genomic sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, revealing diverse mutational landscapes across different tumor types.  This has spurred the development of personalized medicine approaches tailored to individual patient genetic profiles.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows for the identification of driver mutations, informing the selection of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors for EGFR-mutated lung cancer.  Furthermore, immunotherapies, particularly checkpoint inhibitors, exploit tumor-specific neoantigens arising from somatic mutations, achieving remarkable clinical responses in specific patient subsets.  Challenges remain in identifying actionable mutations, predicting treatment response, and managing acquired resistance.  Ongoing research focuses on integrating multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) to refine predictive models, develop novel therapeutic targets, and improve patient stratification for optimal treatment strategies. The ultimate goal is to move towards truly personalized cancer care, maximizing efficacy while minimizing toxicity.
