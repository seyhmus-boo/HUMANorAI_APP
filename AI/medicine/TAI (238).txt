Adolescent mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders, are exhibiting concerning upward trends globally, linked to factors such as social media pressures, academic stress, and societal inequalities.  Effective treatment necessitates an interdisciplinary approach.  Psychiatry provides medication management and diagnostic expertise, while psychology offers therapeutic interventions like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT) targeting maladaptive thought patterns and emotional regulation.  Social work contributes by addressing systemic issues impacting mental wellbeing, such as family dynamics and access to resources.  Furthermore,  educational professionals play a crucial role in early identification and school-based support programs, creating a nurturing environment.  Nutritional guidance and physical activity interventions from allied health professionals also prove valuable, as physical health significantly impacts mental state.  A truly effective strategy for managing adolescent mental health disorders requires collaborative efforts across these disciplines, integrating biological, psychological, and social perspectives for holistic and sustainable care.
