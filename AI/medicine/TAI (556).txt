This presentation examines the experimental challenges inherent in evaluating the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on healthcare diagnostics. While AI offers transformative potential for improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency, rigorous experimental validation remains crucial.  We discuss key challenges in establishing robust ground truth datasets, particularly regarding the complexities of clinical data annotation and the inherent variability in human expert interpretation.  The heterogeneity of patient populations and the resulting biases in training data necessitate careful consideration of algorithmic fairness and generalizability.  Furthermore, the “black box” nature of many AI models presents difficulties in understanding their decision-making processes and establishing trust among clinicians.  We will highlight the need for standardized evaluation metrics, rigorous prospective clinical trials, and transparent reporting to address these experimental challenges.  Ultimately, overcoming these obstacles is crucial for ensuring the safe, effective, and equitable integration of AI into clinical diagnostic workflows.  The presentation will conclude with a discussion of potential solutions and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.
