Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiovascular or respiratory conditions.  Furthermore, alterations in precipitation patterns exacerbate the risk of waterborne diseases through flooding and contamination, while drought conditions increase the incidence of vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever.  Changes in air quality, including increased ground-level ozone and particulate matter from wildfires intensified by climate change, lead to respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular complications.  Indirect impacts are also substantial, with climate-induced food insecurity potentially leading to malnutrition and associated health problems.  Displacement and migration stemming from extreme weather events and sea-level rise further strain healthcare systems and increase the risk of infectious disease outbreaks.  Addressing climate change is therefore critical for safeguarding public health, requiring integrated strategies that encompass mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation measures to build climate resilience in health systems and communities worldwide.  Further research is needed to quantify the full extent of these impacts and inform effective public health interventions.
