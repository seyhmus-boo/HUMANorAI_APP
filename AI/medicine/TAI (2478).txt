Adolescence is a critical period of neurodevelopmental change, marked by significant biological, psychological, and social transitions that render this population vulnerable to the onset of mental health disorders (MHDs).  This paper examines recent trends in the prevalence and presentation of MHDs among adolescents, focusing on key disorders such as depression, anxiety, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).  We analyze data from epidemiological studies to identify emerging patterns in diagnosis rates, exploring potential contributing factors such as societal influences, technological advancements, and evolving diagnostic criteria.  Furthermore, the paper critically reviews the efficacy of current treatment modalities for adolescent MHDs, including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy (specifically cognitive behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy), and integrated approaches.  A particular emphasis is placed on the challenges inherent in providing effective and accessible care for this population, considering factors such as stigma, resource limitations, and the need for tailored interventions that address the unique developmental needs of adolescents.  Finally, we discuss areas for future research, highlighting the need for improved early intervention strategies and the development of innovative treatments to mitigate the long-term impact of adolescent MHDs.
