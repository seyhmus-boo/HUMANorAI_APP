Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the genetic underpinnings of cancer and their implications for personalized medicine.  Think of the human genome as a vast instruction manual, meticulously detailing cellular function.  Cancer arises from errors – mutations – within this manual, akin to typos causing misinterpretations of instructions. These errors can affect genes controlling cell growth, leading to uncontrolled proliferation.

Historically, cancer treatment was a "one-size-fits-all" approach, like using the same wrench to fix different bolts.  Advances in genomics, however, allow us to identify specific mutations driving an individual's cancer. This is like using a specialized wrench for each specific bolt –  personalized medicine.  By sequencing a patient's tumour DNA, we pinpoint the precise "typos" causing the disease. This allows for targeted therapies, like drugs designed to correct the specific genetic error or block the mutated protein's function, maximizing efficacy and minimizing side effects.  This approach, although still evolving, represents a paradigm shift in oncology, moving towards truly individualized cancer care.
