Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant threat to global health, jeopardizing the effective treatment of bacterial infections.  The widespread and often inappropriate use of antibiotics has driven the selection and evolution of resistant strains, rendering previously effective therapies ineffective. This phenomenon is exacerbated by the limited development of novel antibiotics, creating a critical gap in therapeutic options.  The global implications are far-reaching, impacting healthcare systems through increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  AR contributes significantly to the burden of infectious diseases, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with limited access to healthcare and sanitation.  The economic consequences are substantial, including lost productivity, increased healthcare expenditure, and reduced agricultural yields due to resistance in veterinary applications.  Effective strategies to mitigate AR require a multi-pronged approach encompassing prudent antibiotic stewardship, improved infection control practices, accelerated development of novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapeutic strategies, and enhanced surveillance systems for monitoring resistance patterns.  International collaboration and policy changes are crucial to address this urgent global health crisis.  Further research focusing on innovative approaches, including phage therapy and immune-based strategies, is urgently needed to combat the growing threat of AR.
