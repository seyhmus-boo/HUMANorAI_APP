Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  The problem transcends purely medical concerns, necessitating collaborations between microbiologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, and social scientists, among others.  Research highlights the crucial role of One Health initiatives, emphasizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health in AR development and spread.  Agricultural practices, particularly the widespread use of antibiotics in livestock, contribute significantly to the emergence of resistant strains.  Moreover, inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices in both developed and developing nations facilitate the transmission of resistant bacteria.  Economic factors, including access to healthcare and affordable antibiotics, influence both treatment outcomes and preventative strategies. Social scientists can illuminate the behavioral drivers of antibiotic misuse and contribute to the design of effective public health interventions.  Effectively combating AR requires a holistic, interdisciplinary effort that integrates epidemiological surveillance, advanced diagnostic tools, development of novel antimicrobial agents, and robust public health education and policy interventions. The absence of such comprehensive, collaborative action will inevitably lead to a future where common infections become untreatable.
