Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of microorganisms to withstand the effects of antibiotics, poses a significant and escalating global threat.  Its implications extend far beyond the immediate clinical context, necessitating an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and mitigating its pervasive impact. This research paper explores the multifaceted nature of AR and its far-reaching consequences, emphasizing the crucial interplay between various scientific disciplines.  We examine the biological mechanisms driving resistance development, including genetic mutations and horizontal gene transfer, alongside the socio-economic factors contributing to its proliferation. The crucial role of agricultural practices in AR dissemination, the limitations of current diagnostic tools, and the challenges in developing novel antimicrobial agents are analysed within this framework.  Furthermore, the paper investigates the complex interplay between healthcare systems, public health policies, and environmental factors, highlighting the need for integrated strategies encompassing One Health principles.  Ultimately, addressing the global challenge of AR requires a concerted effort involving microbiologists, epidemiologists, economists, policymakers, and social scientists to develop comprehensive and effective solutions.
