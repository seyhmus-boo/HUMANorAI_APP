The evolution of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques has been driven by a pursuit of reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved patient outcomes.  However, this progress has been significantly challenged by experimental limitations.  Early laparoscopic procedures faced difficulties in dexterity and visualization, necessitating the development of advanced instrumentation, including articulated endoscopes and robotic systems.  These innovations, while improving precision, introduced complexities in controlling force and feedback, hindering the translation of open surgical techniques to the minimally invasive setting.  Further challenges arise in the accurate replication of complex procedures in animal models, crucial for pre-clinical validation.  The inherent differences in anatomy and tissue properties between animal models and humans limit the direct transferability of experimental findings. Finally,  long-term studies are essential to fully assess the efficacy and safety of new MIS techniques, requiring substantial time and resources, frequently delaying clinical translation. Overcoming these experimental hurdles remains paramount in furthering the advancement and safety of minimally invasive surgery.
