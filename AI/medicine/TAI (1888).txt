Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using telecommunication technologies, has significantly reshaped modern healthcare delivery, evolving from its rudimentary beginnings in the 1960s.  Early applications, primarily focused on transmitting static images for diagnostic purposes, were limited by technological constraints and bandwidth limitations.  However, advancements in computing power, internet accessibility, and the development of sophisticated medical devices capable of remote monitoring have propelled telemedicine into a mainstream modality.  Today, its applications are diverse, encompassing video conferencing for consultations, remote patient monitoring of vital signs and chronic conditions, and the transmission of medical images for diagnostic review. This expansion has been driven by several factors, including the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases requiring ongoing management, the growing demand for accessible healthcare, particularly in rural and underserved areas, and the rising costs associated with traditional in-person care. Consequently, telemedicine plays a crucial role in improving healthcare access, enhancing patient engagement through remote monitoring and education, and potentially lowering healthcare expenditures.  Nevertheless, challenges remain, including concerns around data security, regulatory hurdles, and ensuring equitable access across different socioeconomic groups.  Future research and development will focus on addressing these challenges to further optimize the efficacy and widespread adoption of this transformative healthcare technology.
