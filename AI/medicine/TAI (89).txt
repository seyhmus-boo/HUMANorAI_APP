Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using telecommunication technologies, has undergone a significant evolution since its nascent stages.  Early applications, dating back to the 1960s with NASA's use of satellite communication for remote medical consultations, primarily focused on addressing geographical barriers to care.  Subsequent decades witnessed incremental advancements, driven by technological progress in areas such as video conferencing and electronic health records.  However, widespread adoption remained limited by factors including bandwidth constraints, regulatory hurdles, and reimbursement limitations.  The advent of high-speed internet and mobile technologies in the late 2000s significantly accelerated telemedicine's growth, facilitating a wider range of applications, from remote patient monitoring and virtual consultations to teleradiology and telehealth education.  Today, telemedicine plays a crucial role in enhancing healthcare accessibility and affordability, particularly in underserved rural areas and for patients with mobility limitations.  Furthermore, it offers potential for improved patient engagement, reduced healthcare costs through decreased travel expenses and hospital readmissions, and improved efficiency in the overall healthcare delivery system.  Nevertheless, ongoing challenges persist concerning data security, interoperability, and equitable access across socioeconomic strata.
