This presentation examines the multifaceted role of vaccination in preventing infectious diseases, highlighting crucial interdisciplinary connections that underpin its success and future development.  We move beyond a purely biomedical perspective to explore the social, economic, and ethical dimensions inherent in vaccination programs.  The social sciences contribute vital insights into vaccine hesitancy, understanding public perception, and developing effective communication strategies to counter misinformation.  Economic analyses are crucial for evaluating cost-effectiveness, resource allocation, and the broader societal impact of vaccination on healthcare systems and productivity.  Ethical considerations regarding equitable access, informed consent, and the balance between individual liberty and collective good will be discussed.  Finally, we will explore the synergistic potential of interdisciplinary collaboration, arguing that integrated approaches encompassing biological, social, economic, and ethical perspectives are critical for optimizing vaccination strategies and achieving global eradication targets for numerous infectious diseases.  The presentation concludes with a call for further interdisciplinary research to address emerging challenges and ensure the continued success of vaccination as a cornerstone of public health.
