Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary response beyond the confines of microbiology.  The emergence and spread of AR are driven by complex interactions between human behaviors (e.g., antibiotic overuse in healthcare and agriculture), environmental factors (e.g., dissemination via wastewater and soil), and bacterial evolutionary processes.  This necessitates collaborations between microbiologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, veterinarians, social scientists, and policymakers.  Effective surveillance strategies require integration of genomic data with epidemiological information to track resistance gene dissemination and predict future outbreaks.  Economically sustainable solutions demand interdisciplinary input in the development of novel antimicrobials, alternative therapies (e.g., phage therapy, immunomodulation), and infection prevention strategies.  Addressing AR effectively requires a One Health approach, acknowledging the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health.  Social sciences can illuminate the drivers of antibiotic misuse and inform public health interventions designed to modify human behavior and promote responsible antibiotic stewardship.  Only through integrated, interdisciplinary efforts can the looming crisis of AR be effectively mitigated and global health security be ensured.
