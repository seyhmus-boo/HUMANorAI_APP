Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of surgical techniques driving this transformation.  Early MIS, largely reliant on laparoscopy, faced limitations in dexterity and visualization.  However, technological advancements, including the development of smaller, more versatile instruments, high-definition endoscopes, and robotic-assisted systems, have significantly expanded the scope of MIS.  The transition from 2D to 3D and now 4K visualization has dramatically improved surgical precision.  Robotic surgery, with its enhanced dexterity and tremor filtration, has opened new avenues for complex procedures previously confined to open surgery.  This presentation will explore the practical applications of these evolving techniques, focusing on their impact in various surgical specialties, such as general surgery, urology, and gynecology. Specific examples will include the transition from traditional laparoscopic cholecystectomy to robotic-assisted approaches, and the increasing use of single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) techniques. Finally, we will discuss ongoing challenges and future directions in MIS, including the role of artificial intelligence and augmented reality in further refining surgical precision and minimizing invasiveness.
