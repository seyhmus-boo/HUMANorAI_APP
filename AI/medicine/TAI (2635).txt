Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's capacity to treat bacterial infections. This presentation will explore the multifaceted nature of AR, examining its underlying mechanisms, drivers, and the far-reaching consequences for human and animal health, as well as global economies.  The rise of multi-drug resistant pathogens necessitates a multi-pronged approach, moving beyond simply developing novel antibiotics.

We will discuss practical applications focusing on strategies to mitigate AR's impact.  These include improving infection prevention and control measures in healthcare settings and agriculture, promoting responsible antibiotic stewardship programs to optimize antibiotic use in human and veterinary medicine, and accelerating the development and implementation of rapid diagnostic tests to guide targeted therapy.  Furthermore, we will explore the potential of alternative therapies, such as phage therapy and novel antimicrobial peptides, to supplement traditional antibiotic treatments.  Finally, the crucial role of global collaboration, data sharing, and policy interventions in combating this critical public health challenge will be highlighted.  This presentation aims to stimulate discussion and collaborative efforts to address this urgent global health crisis.
