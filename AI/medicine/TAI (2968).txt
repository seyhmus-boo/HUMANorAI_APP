Cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease, driven by somatic mutations accumulating within cells.  Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, revealing the complex interplay of driver and passenger mutations across diverse tumor types.  This has fueled the development of personalized medicine, enabling targeted therapies tailored to specific genetic alterations. Recent breakthroughs include the identification of novel oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, leading to the development of inhibitors targeting specific kinase fusions (e.g., ALK, ROS1) and immune checkpoint pathways (e.g., PD-1/PD-L1).  Liquid biopsies, employing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), offer minimally invasive methods for monitoring disease progression, detecting minimal residual disease, and guiding treatment selection.  Furthermore, integrating genomic data with clinical characteristics and other 'omics' data (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) via machine learning algorithms enhances predictive modeling and treatment stratification.  Challenges remain in addressing intratumor heterogeneity, developing effective therapies for complex mutational landscapes, and ensuring equitable access to these advanced technologies. Nevertheless, ongoing research promises further refinement of personalized cancer therapies, paving the way for improved patient outcomes.
