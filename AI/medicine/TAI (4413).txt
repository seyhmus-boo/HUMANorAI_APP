This presentation examines the experimental challenges inherent in evaluating and implementing artificial intelligence (AI) for medical diagnostics.  While AI offers the potential for significantly improved accuracy, speed, and accessibility of diagnoses, rigorous experimental validation remains a critical hurdle.  We will focus on three key challenges: (1) the acquisition and curation of large, high-quality, annotated datasets representative of diverse patient populations and disease presentations.  The inherent biases present in existing datasets, and the difficulties in achieving robust generalizability, present significant limitations. (2) the establishment of robust evaluation metrics beyond simple accuracy, accounting for the complex interplay of clinical context, risk tolerance, and potential harms associated with false positives and negatives.  (3) the integration of AI diagnostic tools into established clinical workflows and the need for human-in-the-loop systems to ensure appropriate oversight and maintain clinician trust.  We will discuss specific examples of these challenges drawn from recent research in areas such as image analysis and genomic prediction, and propose potential strategies for addressing these limitations to facilitate the safe and effective deployment of AI in diagnostic healthcare.  Ultimately, successful implementation hinges on tackling these experimental hurdles to ensure patient safety and improve healthcare outcomes.
