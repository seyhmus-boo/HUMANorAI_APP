Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant global public health concern, with rising prevalence rates observed across diverse populations.  This abstract summarizes current trends and treatment approaches for common adolescent mental health challenges, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  Recent epidemiological studies highlight a concerning increase in diagnoses, potentially influenced by societal factors such as increased screen time, social media pressures, and academic stress.  Effective treatments incorporate evidence-based therapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), alongside pharmacological interventions where clinically indicated.  A personalized approach, considering individual needs and comorbidities, is crucial for optimal outcomes.  Practical applications include the development and implementation of school-based mental health programs promoting early identification, universal screening strategies to detect at-risk individuals, and increased access to affordable and culturally competent mental healthcare services.  Further research is needed to elucidate the complex interplay of risk factors and refine treatment protocols to improve the long-term mental well-being of adolescents, reducing the substantial morbidity and mortality associated with untreated mental health disorders.
