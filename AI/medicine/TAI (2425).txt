The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognized as a critical global challenge.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly impacting vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions.  Recent research highlights the escalating frequency and intensity of heatwaves, exceeding previously established thresholds and necessitating updated public health interventions.  Beyond direct thermal effects, climate change exacerbates existing health risks.  Changes in precipitation patterns influence the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and Zika virus, with expanding geographical ranges and transmission seasons observed in numerous regions.  Furthermore, extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, lead to injuries, displacement, and disruptions to healthcare infrastructure, negatively affecting access to essential services and exacerbating mental health challenges.  Recent studies emphasize the indirect impacts, such as the worsening air quality due to increased wildfires and the nutritional insecurity arising from crop failures.  Addressing this complex interplay requires integrated approaches that encompass mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions alongside adaptation strategies focused on strengthening public health resilience and preparedness for climate-related health impacts.
