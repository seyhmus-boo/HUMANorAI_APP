Antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria to withstand antimicrobial drugs, poses a significant global threat with far-reaching implications.  Its emergence is intrinsically linked to the widespread use of antibiotics since their discovery in the mid-20th century.  Initially hailed as miracle drugs, antibiotics exerted intense selective pressure, favoring the survival and proliferation of resistant strains. This process, driven by natural selection, has accelerated due to factors such as overuse and misuse in human and veterinary medicine, as well as agricultural applications.

Globally, the consequence is a dwindling arsenal of effective antibiotics.  Infections once easily treatable now pose life-threatening challenges, increasing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  Surgical procedures and cancer treatments become significantly riskier, jeopardizing public health infrastructure.  The economic impact encompasses lost productivity, increased healthcare expenditure, and potential disruptions to global trade.  Addressing antibiotic resistance requires a multi-faceted approach involving stewardship programs, accelerated research into novel antimicrobials, and the development and implementation of effective infection control strategies.  Failure to act decisively will result in a return to a pre-antibiotic era, with devastating consequences.
