The emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance represent a significant global health crisis with profound implications.  The widespread use of antibiotics following their discovery in the mid-20th century, initially hailed as a medical miracle, inadvertently fostered the selection pressure driving resistance development.  Bacteria, through mutation and horizontal gene transfer, evolved mechanisms to circumvent the lethal effects of these life-saving drugs. Initially observed sporadically, antibiotic resistance has become a pervasive problem, fueled by factors such as the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, inadequate infection control practices, and the prevalence of antibiotic residues in the environment.  This resistance compromises the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating common infections, resulting in increased morbidity, mortality, and prolonged hospital stays, placing a substantial strain on healthcare systems globally. The implications extend beyond individual health, impacting economic productivity, food security (through the resistance in animal agriculture), and national security.  International collaboration and the implementation of robust stewardship programs are crucial to mitigate this growing threat and ensure the continued availability of effective antibiotics for future generations.
