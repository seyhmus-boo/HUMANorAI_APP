Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant global health concern, exhibiting concerning upward trends in prevalence across various diagnoses, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  This increase is likely multifactorial, influenced by societal changes, increased screen time, and evolving stressors.  Diagnostic challenges persist, particularly differentiating between developmental stages and genuine pathology, highlighting the need for robust assessment tools tailored to this population.  Current treatment approaches predominantly utilize evidence-based psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), alongside pharmacological interventions where appropriate.  However, access to timely and appropriate care remains a major barrier, particularly in low-resource settings.  Future research should focus on refining early detection strategies, developing culturally sensitive interventions, and improving access to evidence-based care.  Practical applications include integrating mental health screening into routine adolescent healthcare, training educators to recognize early warning signs, and fostering community-based support systems. Addressing this pervasive issue requires a multi-pronged strategy encompassing prevention, early intervention, and access to comprehensive treatment.
