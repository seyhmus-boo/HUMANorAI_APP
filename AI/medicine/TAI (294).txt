Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to fully understand and address its complex impacts.  This research paper examines the intricate relationship between climate change and public health outcomes, highlighting the crucial interconnections between environmental science, epidemiology, sociology, economics, and public policy.  While the direct impacts of extreme weather events, such as heat waves and floods, are readily apparent, this study delves deeper into the less immediate but equally critical consequences.  We explore the influence of climate change on vector-borne diseases, respiratory illnesses exacerbated by air pollution, and the exacerbation of pre-existing health inequalities.  Furthermore, we consider the indirect impacts, including mental health consequences stemming from displacement and environmental degradation, and the economic burdens associated with climate-related health crises. By analyzing the interplay between these diverse disciplines, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenge, identify knowledge gaps, and suggest pathways for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies that promote robust and equitable public health systems.
