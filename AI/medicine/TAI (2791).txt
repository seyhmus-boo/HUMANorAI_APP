Telemedicine has rapidly expanded its role in modern healthcare delivery, offering potential for improved access, reduced costs, and enhanced patient convenience.  However, realizing this potential faces significant experimental challenges. This presentation will explore key limitations encountered in evaluating telemedicine's efficacy and scalability. We will focus on methodological difficulties in conducting rigorous randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing telemedicine to in-person care, particularly concerning patient selection bias, the standardization of remote consultations, and the accurate assessment of clinical outcomes across diverse telehealth platforms.  The complexities of data integration and analysis from various sources, including wearable sensors and electronic health records, will also be discussed.  Furthermore, we will address the ethical considerations arising from issues of data privacy and security, alongside the challenges of ensuring equitable access to technology and reliable broadband connectivity for all patient populations.  The presentation concludes by highlighting the need for innovative experimental designs and robust data analytic strategies to overcome these obstacles and generate definitive evidence supporting the widespread adoption of telemedicine.
