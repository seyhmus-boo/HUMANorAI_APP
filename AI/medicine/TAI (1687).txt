Organ transplantation, while offering life-saving potential, presents complex ethical dilemmas.  Central to these is the allocation of scarce organs, demanding a just and equitable system that prioritizes recipients based on medical need, rather than socioeconomic status or other extraneous factors.  The principle of distributive justice necessitates transparent and accountable allocation protocols, often utilizing waiting lists governed by objective criteria.  However, debates persist regarding the weighting of various factors, such as urgency, prognosis, and likelihood of successful transplantation.  Furthermore, ethical concerns arise regarding the informed consent process for both donors and recipients, especially in cases involving deceased donation where surrogate consent from family members is required.  Ensuring true voluntariness and understanding of the implications is crucial, avoiding undue pressure or coercion.  Finally, the commercialization of organs remains a major ethical challenge, with the potential for exploitation and the creation of a market driven by profit rather than medical need.  Robust regulatory frameworks are necessary to prevent such practices and maintain the integrity of the organ transplantation system.
