Cancer is a complex disease driven by genetic alterations accumulating within cells.  Recent advances in genomics have revolutionized our understanding of its genetic basis, fueling the development of personalized medicine approaches. This presentation will explore key developments in this field, focusing on advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies enabling comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors.  We will discuss how this facilitates the identification of driver mutations, crucial for targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy.  The role of liquid biopsies, utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for non-invasive monitoring and early detection, will be highlighted. Furthermore, we will examine the emerging impact of immunogenomics, specifically the characterization of tumor mutational burden (TMB) and neoantigen identification, in guiding immunotherapy selection and predicting response.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the challenges remaining, including the need for improved bioinformatics tools, standardization of genomic assays, and addressing the ethical implications of personalized cancer care,  emphasizing the ongoing evolution of this critical area of cancer research.
