Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has evolved significantly since its early adoption in the 1960s, initially focusing on transmitting medical images for consultation.  This presentation explores the burgeoning role of telemedicine in modern healthcare delivery, highlighting its historical trajectory and contemporary applications.  While early limitations included bandwidth constraints and technological accessibility, recent advancements in broadband internet access, mobile technologies, and sophisticated software have broadened its scope considerably.  We will examine how telemedicine addresses challenges such as geographical limitations in accessing specialists, improving patient engagement through remote monitoring, and facilitating timely interventions in chronic disease management.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the impact of telemedicine on healthcare costs, patient outcomes, and provider efficiency, considering both the advantages and limitations, including concerns regarding data security, digital literacy disparities, and regulatory frameworks.  Finally, we will discuss future directions in telemedicine, including the integration of artificial intelligence and the potential for transforming healthcare delivery models globally.
