Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare diagnostics, offering the potential to improve accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility.  This abstract explores the interdisciplinary nature of AI's impact, highlighting crucial links between computer science, medicine, and data science.  AI algorithms, particularly deep learning models, demonstrate promising results in analyzing medical images (radiology, pathology), interpreting physiological signals (ECG, EEG), and predicting disease risk based on electronic health records.  However, successful implementation requires robust collaboration.  Computer scientists develop and optimize algorithms, while medical professionals provide clinical expertise for data annotation, validation, and interpretation of AI-driven insights.  Data scientists play a crucial role in data preprocessing, feature engineering, and ensuring data quality and privacy.  Ethical considerations, including bias mitigation in algorithms and responsible data handling, necessitate input from ethicists and legal experts.  Overcoming challenges related to data scarcity, algorithm explainability, and regulatory frameworks requires a truly interdisciplinary approach.  Future research should focus on strengthening these collaborations to fully realize the transformative potential of AI in improving healthcare diagnostics and patient outcomes.
