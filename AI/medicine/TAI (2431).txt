Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, with diagnostic applications showing significant promise.  While AI algorithms demonstrate potential for improved accuracy, speed, and accessibility in diagnosis across various medical domains, their implementation faces considerable experimental challenges.  This paper investigates the key obstacles hindering the robust and reliable application of AI in medical diagnostics.  We focus on three critical areas: data limitations, including issues of bias, scarcity, and heterogeneity; the difficulty in establishing and validating ground truth in complex medical cases; and the challenges associated with ensuring algorithmic transparency and explainability, essential for building clinician trust and facilitating effective human-AI collaboration.  These experimental challenges necessitate careful consideration of methodological rigor and the development of robust validation strategies.  Addressing these limitations is crucial for responsible AI integration in healthcare, ensuring that the benefits of improved diagnostic capabilities are realized safely and ethically while minimizing potential risks and biases.  We propose a framework for evaluating and mitigating these challenges to pave the way for the widespread and effective deployment of AI in diagnostic practice.
