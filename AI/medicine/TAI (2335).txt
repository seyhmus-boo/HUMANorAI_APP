Organ transplantation, while offering life-saving potential, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  The scarcity of donor organs necessitates prioritization, raising concerns about distributive justice.  Allocation systems, while striving for fairness based on medical urgency and compatibility,  continue to be debated, with ongoing research exploring alternative metrics like life expectancy and quality-adjusted life years.  Recent advancements in xenotransplantation, utilizing animal organs, introduce novel ethical challenges concerning animal welfare and the potential for zoonotic diseases.  Moreover, the definition of death remains a crucial consideration, especially with advancements in brain death determination.  Informed consent, a cornerstone of ethical transplantation, necessitates careful consideration of patient autonomy and capacity, particularly in cases of minors or individuals with cognitive impairment.  Furthermore, the potential for coercion and exploitation within living donation remains a pressing concern, demanding robust regulatory frameworks and safeguards to protect vulnerable donors.  Addressing these complex issues requires interdisciplinary collaboration encompassing medical professionals, ethicists, and policymakers.
