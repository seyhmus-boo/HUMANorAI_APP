Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly antibiotic resistance, poses a significant and escalating threat to global health security.  This review examines the multifaceted nature of antibiotic resistance and its far-reaching global implications across healthcare systems, economies, and societal well-being. The uncontrolled and often inappropriate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, has driven the selection and proliferation of resistant pathogens.  This has resulted in a dramatic increase in treatment failures for common infections, leading to prolonged illness, increased mortality, and higher healthcare costs.  The emergence and dissemination of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) further exacerbates the challenge, rendering existing treatment options ineffective and jeopardizing the efficacy of last-resort antibiotics. This paper explores the diverse contributing factors to the global AMR crisis, including the interplay between environmental contamination, agricultural practices, and healthcare settings. Furthermore, we analyze the current strategies employed to combat AMR, such as stewardship programs, novel antibiotic development, and the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches.  Finally, we discuss the crucial need for collaborative, multi-sectoral interventions to mitigate the pervasive and potentially catastrophic implications of antibiotic resistance on a global scale.
