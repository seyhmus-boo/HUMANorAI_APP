Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health. This presentation examines the complex interplay between environmental shifts and human health outcomes, focusing on both direct and indirect impacts.  Direct impacts, such as increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the expansion of vector-borne diseases, and the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to air pollution, are explored through analysis of existing epidemiological data.  Indirect effects, including malnutrition stemming from disrupted agricultural yields, mental health consequences from displacement and extreme weather events, and the increased burden on healthcare systems due to overwhelmed infrastructure, will also be considered.  The presentation will synthesize recent research highlighting disparities in vulnerability and the disproportionate impact of climate change on marginalized populations.  Finally, it will briefly discuss strategies for mitigating climate change's health impacts through policy interventions focusing on adaptation and resilience building, emphasizing the critical need for integrated approaches combining climate science, public health practice, and social justice considerations.  We argue for a proactive, multi-sectoral response to effectively address this critical global challenge.
