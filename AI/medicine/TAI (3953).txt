Antibiotic resistance, a growing global crisis, threatens the effective treatment of bacterial infections.  This presentation explores the historical context of antibiotic resistance, tracing its emergence from the post-World War II era of widespread antibiotic use.  Initially hailed as a medical miracle, antibiotics rapidly became indispensable in healthcare, agriculture, and animal husbandry, leading to widespread selection pressure on bacterial populations.  This presentation will analyze the key mechanisms driving resistance development, including horizontal gene transfer and spontaneous mutations, and discuss their impact on various bacterial species.  The global implications are far-reaching, impacting healthcare systems through increased morbidity, mortality, and treatment costs.  Furthermore, the economic consequences extend beyond healthcare, affecting agricultural productivity and food security.  We will examine the current landscape of resistance surveillance and intervention strategies, including the urgent need for novel antibiotics, improved infection control practices, and responsible antibiotic stewardship programs.  Finally, the presentation will advocate for a multi-sectoral approach involving governments, healthcare professionals, researchers, and the public to address this formidable global threat effectively.
