While a direct, macroscopic application of quantum mechanics to climate change's impact on public health seems tenuous, a deeper consideration reveals indirect links. Climate change, driven by increased greenhouse gas concentrations, fundamentally alters the global energy balance.  This macroscopic shift can be understood as a perturbation of the complex quantum system encompassing Earth's atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere.

Changes in atmospheric composition affect the interaction of photons with molecules, impacting radiative transfer and ultimately influencing weather patterns.  These alterations, though classically described, originate from quantum-mechanical processes at the molecular level.  Extreme weather events, a consequence of this energy imbalance, directly impact public health via increased morbidity and mortality from heatstroke, vector-borne diseases, and natural disasters.  Further, alterations in sea level and ocean acidification, driven by quantum processes influencing molecular bonding and solubility, threaten coastal populations and marine ecosystems, impacting food security and increasing displacement, indirectly affecting mental and physical health.  Therefore, while climate change is classically modeled, understanding its impacts requires appreciating the underlying quantum-mechanical foundations of molecular interactions and energy transfer that drive these large-scale phenomena.
