Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare diagnostics, offering the potential to improve accuracy, speed, and accessibility of medical assessments. This presentation explores the significant impact of recent AI developments in this field.  We will examine the application of machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs), in image analysis for radiology, pathology, and ophthalmology. Recent advancements have shown impressive results in detecting subtle anomalies in medical images, surpassing human performance in certain tasks like cancer detection in mammograms and the identification of diabetic retinopathy.  Furthermore, we will discuss the burgeoning field of AI-powered natural language processing (NLP) for analyzing electronic health records (EHRs) to improve diagnostic efficiency and risk stratification.  However, challenges remain, including the need for large, high-quality annotated datasets for training robust AI models, ensuring algorithmic transparency and bias mitigation, and addressing ethical considerations surrounding clinical decision support systems.  This presentation will conclude by highlighting future directions for AI in diagnostics, focusing on the potential for personalized medicine and the integration of AI into existing clinical workflows.
