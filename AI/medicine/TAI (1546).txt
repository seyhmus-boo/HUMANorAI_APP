This review examines current trends and treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents, a population experiencing a concerning rise in prevalence.  Data indicates escalating rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors, particularly amongst girls.  Contributing factors include societal pressures, increased screen time, and the impact of social media.  While traditional therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and medication remain cornerstones of treatment, this review highlights the growing interest in and efficacy of evidence-based interventions like mindfulness-based interventions and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), particularly for managing emotional dysregulation.  Furthermore, the integration of family-based therapies is increasingly recognized as crucial given the interconnectedness of family dynamics and adolescent mental well-being.  However, significant barriers to access, including financial constraints, stigma, and a shortage of qualified professionals, persist.  Future research should focus on developing culturally sensitive, accessible, and cost-effective interventions, as well as investigating the long-term impact of early intervention strategies.  Addressing these challenges is critical for improving adolescent mental health outcomes and mitigating the long-term consequences of untreated disorders.
