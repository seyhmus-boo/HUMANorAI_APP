Climate change presents a multifaceted threat to global public health, extending far beyond the commonly acknowledged impacts of extreme weather events.  Recent research has increasingly illuminated the complex and cascading effects of a changing climate on human well-being, revealing a spectrum of previously underestimated risks. This paper explores the intricate relationship between climate change and public health, focusing on key recent developments in the field.  We move beyond established links like heat-related mortality and the spread of vector-borne diseases, to examine emerging concerns.  These include the impacts of climate change on air quality, mental health, food security, and the exacerbation of existing health inequalities.  The analysis will incorporate recent findings from epidemiological studies, modelling projections, and policy analyses to illustrate the dynamic and evolving nature of this critical relationship.  Specifically, we will consider the implications of increased climate migration, the challenges in attributing specific health outcomes to climate change, and the evolving strategies for climate change adaptation and mitigation within the public health sector.  The ultimate aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest research, highlighting the urgent need for integrated, multi-sectoral approaches to address this growing global challenge.
