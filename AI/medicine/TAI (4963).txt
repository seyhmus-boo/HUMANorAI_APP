Adolescent mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and substance use, exhibit concerning upward trends globally, influenced by complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors.  Biological vulnerabilities, such as genetic predispositions, interact with environmental stressors like academic pressure and social media usage, shaping individual risk profiles.  Effective treatment necessitates an interdisciplinary approach.  Psychiatrists provide pharmacological interventions, while psychologists offer evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), addressing cognitive distortions and maladaptive coping mechanisms.  Social workers navigate social determinants of health, connecting families to crucial resources and support systems.  Furthermore, educators play a pivotal role in early identification and intervention, creating supportive school environments. This holistic, interdisciplinary model recognizes the multifaceted nature of adolescent mental health challenges, emphasizing collaboration across disciplines to provide comprehensive and effective care, improving outcomes and reducing long-term morbidity.  Future research should focus on strengthening these interdisciplinary links to optimize prevention and treatment strategies.
