Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant global public health concern, exhibiting escalating prevalence rates across various diagnostic categories.  This summary examines recent trends and treatment approaches for common disorders such as anxiety, depression, and substance use.  Data consistently demonstrate a rising incidence of anxiety and depressive disorders, particularly among females, often linked to societal pressures, academic stress, and social media usage.  Substance use disorders are also prevalent, frequently co-occurring with other mental health conditions, necessitating integrated care models.  Treatment approaches are evolving, moving beyond traditional pharmacotherapy to encompass evidence-based psychosocial interventions like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).  These therapies are increasingly delivered in flexible formats, including online platforms, to improve accessibility and reduce stigma.  Early intervention and a focus on preventative strategies, such as promoting mental wellbeing in schools, are crucial in mitigating the long-term impact of these disorders.  Further research is needed to investigate the effectiveness of emerging technologies in mental health care, tailor interventions to diverse adolescent populations, and address systemic barriers hindering access to timely and appropriate treatment.
