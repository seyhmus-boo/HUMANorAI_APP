Adolescence is a critical period of neurodevelopmental maturation marked by significant physical, emotional, and social changes, rendering this population particularly vulnerable to the onset of mental health disorders (MHDs).  This paper examines current trends in the prevalence and presentation of MHDs among adolescents, focusing on key disorders such as anxiety, depression, and substance use.  We analyze data from recent epidemiological studies to identify evolving patterns in diagnosis rates, considering potential contributing factors such as societal pressures, technological advancements, and access to healthcare. Furthermore, the paper explores the efficacy and limitations of current treatment modalities, including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy (specifically Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy), and family-based interventions.  A critical evaluation of the existing evidence base highlights gaps in research, particularly regarding long-term outcomes and culturally sensitive approaches to treatment.  Ultimately, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the challenges and advancements in the field, informing future research directions and the development of more effective and accessible interventions for adolescents struggling with MHDs.
