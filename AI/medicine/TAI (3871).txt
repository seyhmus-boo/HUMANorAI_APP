Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, demanding urgent intervention.  The experimental challenges in combating AR are multifaceted.  Firstly, identifying novel antibiotic targets is hampered by the intricate nature of bacterial physiology and the rapid evolution of resistance mechanisms.  High-throughput screening techniques, while valuable, often yield compounds with limited efficacy or high toxicity.  Secondly, developing new antibiotics faces considerable economic hurdles; the lengthy and costly drug development pipeline often deters investment, particularly for diseases prevalent in low-income countries.  Thirdly,  in vitro studies often fail to accurately reflect in vivo conditions, leading to discrepancies between promising laboratory results and clinical efficacy.  The complex interplay of host immunity, bacterial communities, and environmental factors further complicates preclinical and clinical trials.  Finally, the global spread of resistant strains necessitates robust surveillance systems, which are often lacking in resource-limited settings, hindering effective containment strategies and precise epidemiological modelling.  Overcoming these experimental challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing innovative drug discovery platforms, improved preclinical models,  global collaborative efforts, and strategic investment in research and development.
