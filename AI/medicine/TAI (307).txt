Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating threat to global health security.  This presentation will examine the multifaceted nature of AR, highlighting its complex interplay of microbial evolution, human behavior, and societal factors.  The widespread overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, have driven the selection and dissemination of resistant pathogens across diverse ecological niches.  The resulting increase in treatment failures leads to prolonged illness, increased mortality rates, and substantial healthcare costs.  We will explore the global burden of AR, focusing on the impact on healthcare systems, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with limited resources.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the critical need for a multi-pronged approach to combat AR, encompassing strengthened surveillance systems, responsible antibiotic stewardship, the development of novel antimicrobials and alternative therapeutic strategies, and enhanced public health initiatives promoting infection prevention and control.  Finally, the presentation will underscore the urgent need for international collaboration and policy interventions to mitigate the looming crisis of untreatable infections.
