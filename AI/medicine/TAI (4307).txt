Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, extending far beyond the traditionally recognized impacts. This presentation explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human well-being, highlighting key areas of vulnerability. We will examine the direct effects, such as increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the exacerbation of infectious disease transmission through altered vector ecology, and the impact of extreme weather events on physical and mental health.  Indirect impacts, including food insecurity, displacement, and economic instability, will also be discussed.  

The presentation will emphasize the practical applications of this understanding, focusing on the development of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies.  We will consider examples of public health interventions, including early warning systems for extreme weather, targeted vaccination campaigns against climate-sensitive diseases, and the implementation of urban planning initiatives to mitigate the urban heat island effect.  Furthermore, the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists, public health professionals, and policymakers in addressing this complex challenge will be highlighted.  The aim is to provide a framework for building resilient and climate-resilient health systems capable of effectively managing the escalating health risks associated with climate change.
