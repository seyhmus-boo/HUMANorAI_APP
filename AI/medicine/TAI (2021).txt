Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding urgent attention from researchers and policymakers. This presentation explores the complex interplay between climate change and various health outcomes, moving beyond simplistic correlations to examine nuanced causal pathways.  We will examine the direct impacts, such as increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, and exacerbated respiratory illnesses due to worsening air quality.  Further, we will discuss indirect impacts including malnutrition resulting from agricultural disruptions and mental health consequences stemming from displacement and trauma associated with extreme weather events.

Practical applications of this research are crucial.  We will present examples of effective adaptation strategies, including early warning systems for heat waves and vector-borne disease outbreaks, improved infrastructure to mitigate flood risks, and public health interventions targeted at vulnerable populations.  Furthermore, we will discuss the role of data-driven modelling in predicting future health impacts and informing resource allocation.  The presentation concludes by emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaborations and policy initiatives to mitigate climate change's adverse effects on public health and build climate-resilient communities.
