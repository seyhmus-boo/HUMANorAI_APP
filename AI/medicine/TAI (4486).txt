Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services utilizing telecommunication technologies, has experienced exponential growth, fundamentally altering modern healthcare delivery.  While traditionally analyzed through socio-economic and logistical lenses, this research explores telemedicine through a novel, albeit nascent, quantum mechanical framework.  This approach departs from classical analyses of efficiency and access, instead considering the inherent uncertainties and probabilistic nature of both the patient's condition and the diagnostic/therapeutic process.  We propose that the quantum mechanical principles of superposition and entanglement offer valuable insights into the complexities of remote diagnosis and treatment.  Superposition, representing the simultaneous existence of multiple possible patient states before measurement (diagnosis), highlights the inherent uncertainties in remote assessment.  Entanglement, mirroring the interconnectedness of the patient, provider, and technological infrastructure, underscores the dependencies influencing successful telemedicine implementation. This research will investigate how a quantum-inspired approach can illuminate the limitations and potentials of telemedicine, potentially leading to improved system design, error reduction, and enhanced patient outcomes. We will focus on quantifying uncertainty in remote diagnosis and exploring the entanglement of information flow within the telemedicine ecosystem.
