Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, impacting populations globally through a complex interplay of direct and indirect effects. This presentation will explore the established and emerging linkages between a changing climate and human health outcomes.  We will examine direct impacts such as increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the expansion of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, and the worsening of air quality due to intensified wildfires and pollution.  Furthermore, we will discuss the indirect consequences, including malnutrition stemming from disrupted agricultural yields, mental health challenges associated with climate-related displacement and trauma, and the exacerbation of existing health inequalities disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations.  The presentation will synthesize current scientific evidence, highlighting the urgent need for integrated and comprehensive strategies to mitigate climate change and bolster public health resilience.  Specific examples of successful adaptation and mitigation strategies, focusing on both global and regional contexts, will be presented to inform policy and practice aimed at safeguarding population health in the face of a changing climate.  The ultimate goal is to underscore the imperative for collaborative action across sectors to protect human health in the era of anthropogenic climate change.
