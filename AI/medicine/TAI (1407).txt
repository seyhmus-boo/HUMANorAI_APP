Antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria to withstand the effects of antibiotics, poses a significant global health threat.  The overuse and misuse of antibiotics, coupled with their inherent selective pressure, drive the evolution and proliferation of resistant strains. This phenomenon undermines the effectiveness of crucial treatments for bacterial infections, leading to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  The global implications are profound, affecting both developed and developing nations, particularly impacting vulnerable populations with limited access to healthcare.  

Practically, the implications translate to longer hospital stays, increased treatment failures, and the resurgence of previously controlled infectious diseases.  The economic burden encompasses escalating healthcare expenditures and potential losses in productivity.  Practical applications to mitigate resistance include stringent antibiotic stewardship programs, promoting responsible antibiotic use in human and animal health,  investing in research and development of novel antibiotics and alternative therapies like bacteriophages, and implementing robust surveillance systems to track resistance patterns globally.  Effective public health interventions, including improved hygiene and sanitation, are also crucial to limit the spread of resistant bacteria.
