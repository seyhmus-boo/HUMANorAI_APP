Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution, driven by technological advancements and a pursuit of reduced patient trauma.  Early MIS, characterized by laparoscopy, relied on 2D visualization and limited instrument articulation, hindering precision and dexterity.  However, advancements in optics, such as high-definition 3D laparoscopy and robotic surgery, have significantly improved surgical visualization and control.  Robotic systems, with their enhanced dexterity and tremor filtration, allow for complex procedures previously unattainable via laparoscopy.

Recent developments include single-port access surgery (SPAS) minimizing incisions further, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), utilizing natural orifices as entry points, although the latter remains limited by technical challenges.  Furthermore, the integration of advanced imaging modalities, such as intraoperative ultrasound and fluorescence imaging, enhances real-time visualization and facilitates more precise targeting of lesions.  Artificial intelligence is emerging as a powerful tool, aiding in surgical planning, intraoperative guidance, and potentially even autonomous robotic assistance.  This ongoing evolution promises to continue improving patient outcomes and expanding the scope of MIS.
