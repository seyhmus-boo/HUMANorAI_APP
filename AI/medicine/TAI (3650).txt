Adolescence, a period marked by significant biological, psychological, and social transitions, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and development of mental health disorders.  This paper examines emerging trends in the prevalence and presentation of these disorders among adolescents, focusing on key diagnoses such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  While prevalence rates continue to rise globally, presenting significant challenges to healthcare systems, this increase is also influenced by evolving diagnostic criteria, increased awareness, and improved access to screening tools.  Furthermore, this paper explores advancements in treatment modalities, examining the efficacy of evidence-based interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacological approaches. A particular focus will be placed on the integration of technology-mediated interventions, such as telehealth and mobile applications, which offer promising avenues for improved access and engagement, particularly in underserved communities.  Understanding these trends and treatment advancements is crucial for informing the development of effective prevention strategies, early intervention programs, and accessible, culturally sensitive mental healthcare services for adolescents, ultimately contributing to improved long-term mental health outcomes and social functioning.
