Adolescents experience a disproportionately high prevalence of mental health disorders (MHDs), including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, with significant implications for long-term well-being.  Recent trends indicate a rising incidence, potentially influenced by societal factors such as increased screen time and social media usage, alongside ongoing challenges in early identification and access to appropriate care. Effective treatment requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating expertise from psychiatry, psychology, social work, and neuroscience.  Psychological interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) demonstrate efficacy in managing many MHDs.  Pharmacological approaches, though often debated, play a crucial role in specific cases, particularly when co-occurring conditions exist.  Furthermore, family-based therapies recognize the crucial influence of familial dynamics and provide valuable support structures.  Advances in neuroscience are enhancing our understanding of neurobiological mechanisms underlying MHDs, paving the way for more targeted interventions.  Future research should focus on strengthening interdisciplinary collaboration, improving early detection strategies through school-based screening programs, and tailoring interventions to address the specific needs of diverse adolescent populations, ultimately reducing the significant burden of MHDs on this vulnerable group.
