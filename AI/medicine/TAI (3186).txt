Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, with disorders often dismissed as "phase-related" or attributed solely to hormonal fluctuations.  However, epidemiological research now reveals a concerning rise in mental health disorders among adolescents globally, particularly anxiety and depression.  Factors contributing to this trend include societal pressures related to academic achievement, social media usage, and increased exposure to trauma and violence.  Furthermore,  genetic predisposition and epigenetic influences interact with environmental stressors to shape vulnerability.

Treatment approaches have evolved significantly.  Traditional psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), remain cornerstones, demonstrating efficacy in managing anxiety, depression, and other conditions.  Pharmacological interventions, while controversial regarding long-term effects in adolescents, are sometimes necessary to manage severe symptoms.  Integrated approaches, combining therapy with medication and lifestyle interventions, are increasingly favored.  However, access to evidence-based care remains inequitable, highlighting the crucial need for improved mental health literacy, early intervention strategies, and readily available resources specifically tailored to the unique needs of this age group.  Future research should focus on personalized medicine approaches considering individual genetic and environmental risk profiles.
