Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has rapidly evolved, transforming modern healthcare delivery. This paper examines the multifaceted role of telemedicine in addressing contemporary healthcare challenges and explores its impact on patient access, clinical outcomes, and healthcare system efficiency.  We analyze the diverse applications of telemedicine, ranging from remote monitoring of chronic conditions and virtual consultations to teleradiology and telehealth-supported surgery.  Furthermore, we investigate the associated technological advancements driving its expansion, including the increasing availability of high-speed internet, sophisticated mobile applications, and robust data security protocols.  While the benefits of telemedicine are substantial, this paper also critically assesses its limitations, encompassing issues of digital literacy disparities, equitable access across demographics, and the regulatory complexities surrounding its implementation.  The concluding section synthesizes the findings and discusses the future trajectory of telemedicine, highlighting its potential to reshape healthcare systems globally while addressing the challenges that need to be overcome for its widespread and equitable adoption.
