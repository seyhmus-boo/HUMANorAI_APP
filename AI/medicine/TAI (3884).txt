Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma compared to open surgery, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This paper examines the evolution of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, tracing its progression from early laparoscopic approaches to the sophisticated technologies employed today.  Early development focused primarily on adapting existing open surgical techniques to a laparoscopic setting, often hampered by limited visualization and dexterity.  However,  the subsequent decades have witnessed a dramatic expansion driven by technological advancements.  Robotic surgery, initially introduced with the da Vinci system, has significantly improved precision and control, enabling complex procedures previously unattainable via laparoscopy.  Furthermore, advancements in imaging modalities, such as 3D laparoscopy and augmented reality, have enhanced surgical visualization and planning.  Recent years have also seen a rise in natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-port access techniques, further minimizing invasiveness and improving cosmetic outcomes.  This review will critically analyze these key developments, discussing their impact on surgical outcomes, patient recovery, and the future direction of minimally invasive surgical practice.
