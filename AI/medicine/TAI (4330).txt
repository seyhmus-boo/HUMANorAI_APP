Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health globally.  This abstract examines the established and emerging links between a changing climate and human health outcomes.  Rising temperatures are directly associated with increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, impacting regions previously unaffected.  Extreme weather events, including floods, droughts, and wildfires, cause immediate injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences, while also disrupting healthcare infrastructure and access.  Furthermore, climate change impacts food security and water resources, exacerbating malnutrition and waterborne diseases.  Indirect effects include air pollution exacerbation from wildfires and increased pollen production, leading to respiratory illnesses.  Addressing climate change is therefore critical for safeguarding public health.  Mitigation strategies focusing on greenhouse gas reduction and adaptation measures including early warning systems for extreme weather events and improved healthcare infrastructure are urgently required to minimize the anticipated health burdens of a changing climate.  Further research is needed to refine predictive models and to quantify the economic and social costs associated with climate change-related health impacts.
