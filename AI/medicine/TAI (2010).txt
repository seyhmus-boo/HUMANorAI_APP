Organ transplantation offers life-saving benefits but presents profound ethical challenges.  This abstract reviews recent developments and persistent ethical dilemmas in this field.  The persistent shortage of organs fuels ongoing debates regarding equitable allocation, with emerging strategies like expanded criteria donors and machine perfusion impacting fairness and resource optimization.  Ethical concerns around informed consent, particularly in vulnerable populations and with deceased donors, remain critical.  The increasing use of artificial intelligence in organ allocation necessitates transparent algorithms and scrutiny to avoid algorithmic bias.  Furthermore, the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation introduces novel ethical dimensions relating to animal welfare, potential zoonotic disease transmission, and the definition of humanness.  Balancing the imperative to save lives with the protection of individual autonomy and societal well-being necessitates rigorous ethical frameworks that address issues of justice, transparency, and public accountability.  Future research should focus on refining allocation algorithms, strengthening informed consent processes, and fostering public dialogue to address evolving challenges in this vital area of medicine.
