Cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease, driven by somatic mutations accumulating within cells.  Recent advances in genomics, particularly next-generation sequencing (NGS), have revolutionized our understanding of its genetic basis, fueling the development of personalized medicine approaches.  Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing now routinely identify driver mutations and other genomic alterations underpinning tumorigenesis, enabling more precise diagnosis and prognosis.  This has led to the emergence of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), specifically designed to exploit the unique genetic profile of individual cancers.  Furthermore, the integration of genomic data with clinical information through large-scale datasets and bioinformatics tools allows for the identification of predictive biomarkers for treatment response and resistance.  While challenges remain, including the complexity of tumor heterogeneity and the cost of comprehensive genomic profiling, ongoing research in areas like liquid biopsies, circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) analysis, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies based on gene editing technologies promise to further enhance the precision and efficacy of personalized cancer medicine.  These advances hold immense potential for improving patient outcomes and transforming cancer care from a one-size-fits-all to a truly personalized approach.
