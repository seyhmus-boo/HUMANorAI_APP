Cancer, a complex group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, is significantly influenced by an individual's genetic makeup.  Advances in genomic technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, enabling the identification of numerous driver mutations, oncogenes, and tumor suppressor genes involved in carcinogenesis. This has paved the way for the development of personalized medicine approaches aimed at improving cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment. This review explores the significant advancements in understanding the genetic landscape of various cancers, focusing on the identification of targetable mutations and their implications for therapeutic strategies. We examine the role of next-generation sequencing (NGS) in comprehensive genomic profiling, highlighting its impact on the selection of targeted therapies, immunotherapy, and the prediction of treatment response. Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and limitations of current personalized medicine approaches, including the cost-effectiveness of widespread genomic testing, the interpretation of complex genomic data, and the need for robust clinical trial designs to validate the efficacy of targeted therapies.  Ultimately, this review emphasizes the transformative potential of integrating genomic information into clinical practice to deliver more effective and precise cancer care.
