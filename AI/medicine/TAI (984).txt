Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the concerning trends and evolving treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents.  We're witnessing a significant rise in anxiety and depression diagnoses, particularly amongst young females, possibly attributable to increased social media usage and academic pressures.  Furthermore, the prevalence of eating disorders and self-harm behaviours remains a critical concern.

Recent research highlights the limitations of traditional talk therapy in isolation for severe cases.  Consequently, integrated approaches combining psychotherapy, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), with pharmacological interventions are increasingly favoured.  Specific advancements include the development of more targeted antidepressants with reduced side effects and the exploration of novel therapeutic strategies like mindfulness-based interventions and digital therapeutics.  However, early intervention remains paramount, emphasising the crucial role of screening programs and fostering supportive school environments.  Further research into the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors is necessary to optimize prevention and treatment strategies for this vulnerable population.
