Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents significant challenges to the advancement of personalized medicine. While genomic sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of oncogenesis, translating this knowledge into effective therapies remains complex.  Identifying driver mutations amidst a backdrop of passenger mutations is crucial, but computationally intensive and prone to errors in variant interpretation.  Furthermore, the dynamic nature of tumour evolution necessitates longitudinal monitoring, posing challenges in sample acquisition and analysis.  The development of robust and clinically validated assays to accurately assess tumour mutational burden and predict treatment response is an ongoing area of intense research.  Experimental limitations also include the difficulty in modelling complex tumour microenvironments *in vitro* and *in vivo*, hindering the accurate prediction of drug efficacy and resistance mechanisms. Finally, ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and the equitable access to advanced genomic testing and targeted therapies pose considerable societal challenges to the widespread implementation of personalized cancer medicine. Overcoming these experimental hurdles is paramount for realizing the full potential of personalized oncology.
