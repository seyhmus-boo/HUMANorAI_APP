This presentation explores the multifaceted role of vaccination in preventing infectious diseases, highlighting crucial interdisciplinary connections vital for successful public health outcomes.  Beyond the biological mechanisms of immunity, we examine the social, economic, and ethical dimensions impacting vaccination efficacy and uptake.  The presentation will analyze the interplay between virology/immunology (exploring vaccine development and effectiveness), epidemiology (assessing disease burden and vaccine impact), and public health (addressing vaccine hesitancy and implementation strategies).  Furthermore, we will discuss the economic implications, including the cost-effectiveness of vaccination programs versus the societal costs of outbreaks.  Ethical considerations, such as informed consent, vaccine equity, and potential adverse events, will be critically evaluated.  The interdisciplinary lens reveals that successful vaccination programs require collaboration across scientific disciplines, public health agencies, policymakers, and the community to address complex societal factors influencing vaccination behaviour and ultimately contribute to disease eradication.  The presentation will conclude by outlining future research directions crucial for optimizing vaccination strategies in a globally interconnected world.
