Cancer, a complex disease, arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting its normal growth regulation.  Recent advances in genomics have revolutionized our understanding of this genetic basis, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Next-generation sequencing technologies allow for comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, identifying driver mutations unique to each patient's cancer.  This detailed genetic landscape informs targeted therapies, shifting from a "one-size-fits-all" approach to individualized treatments.

For instance, the identification of specific oncogenic mutations in lung cancer, such as EGFR mutations, has led to the development of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, dramatically improving patient outcomes.  Similarly, immunotherapies, harnessing the power of the patient's immune system, are tailored based on the tumor's mutational burden and expression of immune checkpoints.  Ongoing research focuses on improving our ability to predict treatment response, incorporating factors like tumor microenvironment and epigenetic modifications, ultimately refining personalized cancer treatment strategies.  The integration of big data analytics further accelerates the development and validation of these personalized approaches.
