Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding careful scrutiny. This presentation will explore key ethical challenges inherent in the process, from organ procurement to allocation and transplantation.  We will critically examine the principles of justice, autonomy, and beneficence within the context of scarce resources and the inherent vulnerability of potential donors and recipients.  Specific areas of focus include the ethical implications of different organ procurement methods, particularly the debate surrounding presumed consent versus explicit consent.  Further, the presentation will address the complexities of equitable allocation systems, considering factors such as medical urgency, waiting list time, and potential biases that may disadvantage certain demographic groups.  Finally, we will discuss the emerging ethical dilemmas presented by advancements in organ preservation and xenotransplantation, highlighting the need for ongoing dialogue and robust ethical frameworks to guide future practices and ensure equitable and just access to life-saving transplantation services.  The presentation will conclude by suggesting potential strategies for mitigating these ethical challenges and promoting transparency and trust within the transplantation community.
