Antibiotic resistance, a growing global health crisis, represents a significant threat to human and animal health.  Its historical roots trace back to the discovery and widespread use of penicillin in the mid-20th century, initially heralded as a miracle cure.  However, the subsequent overuse and misuse of antibiotics, coupled with inadequate infection control practices, fuelled the selection and proliferation of resistant bacteria.  This has led to a dramatic increase in infections that are difficult or impossible to treat with available antibiotics.

The global implications are profound.  Treatment failures result in prolonged illness, increased morbidity and mortality, and escalating healthcare costs.  The impact extends beyond human health, affecting food security through the resistance in livestock and impacting agricultural productivity.  Furthermore, the lack of new antibiotic development pipelines exacerbates the situation, threatening a return to pre-antibiotic era mortality rates for common infections.  Effective strategies to combat this crisis demand a multifaceted approach encompassing responsible antibiotic stewardship, investment in research and development of novel antimicrobials, improved sanitation and hygiene practices, and robust surveillance systems to monitor the spread of resistant pathogens.  Without concerted global action, the consequences will be catastrophic.
