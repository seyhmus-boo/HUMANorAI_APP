Adolescents experience a disproportionately high prevalence of mental health disorders, with trends indicating a concerning rise in conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders in recent years.  Contributing factors are complex and multifaceted, encompassing biological predispositions, psychosocial stressors (e.g., academic pressure, social media influence, trauma), and socio-environmental influences (e.g., poverty, community violence). Effective treatment necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, recognizing the interwoven nature of these factors.  Psychiatrists provide medication management and diagnostic assessment, while psychologists offer evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to address maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors.  Social workers connect adolescents and families with necessary resources, navigate systemic barriers, and provide case management.  Furthermore, school counselors play a crucial role in early identification, intervention, and fostering supportive school environments.  The collaborative efforts of these professionals, along with input from family physicians and potentially neurologists or other specialists depending on the specific presentation, are vital for comprehensive assessment, personalized treatment plans, and improved outcomes in adolescent mental healthcare.  This holistic approach underscores the need for improved interdisciplinary communication and collaboration to address the escalating mental health crisis amongst young people.
