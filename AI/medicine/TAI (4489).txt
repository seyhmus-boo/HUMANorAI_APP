Antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria to withstand antimicrobial drugs, poses a significant global health threat.  Its emergence is driven by selective pressure exerted by widespread antibiotic use in human and veterinary medicine, as well as agriculture.  Experimentally, understanding the precise mechanisms underlying resistance development presents considerable challenges.  Studying the complex interplay between bacterial genetics, physiology, and the environment requires sophisticated techniques, including genomic sequencing to identify resistance genes and proteomic analysis to characterise altered protein expression.  Furthermore, recreating the *in vivo* conditions that select for resistance in controlled laboratory settings is difficult, leading to potential inaccuracies in modelling the phenomenon.  In addition, the evolution of multi-drug resistance, where bacteria are resistant to multiple antibiotics, further complicates experimental investigations, demanding the development of novel screening assays and high-throughput approaches to assess the effectiveness of potential new therapeutics.  Ultimately, overcoming these experimental hurdles is crucial to developing effective strategies to combat the global rise of antibiotic-resistant infections.
