Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents a significant challenge to treatment, but recent advances in genomics are revolutionizing personalized medicine.  The identification of specific driver mutations, through techniques like next-generation sequencing, allows for targeted therapies.  This move beyond traditional chemotherapy, based on broad cytotoxic effects, is paramount.  For instance, the detection of *EGFR* mutations in lung cancer guides the prescription of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, offering significantly improved outcomes for patients with these specific mutations.  Furthermore, advancements in liquid biopsies, analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), allow for minimally invasive monitoring of disease progression and response to treatment, facilitating real-time adjustments to therapeutic strategies.  Ongoing research into immunotherapies, particularly harnessing the power of the patient's own immune system through checkpoint inhibitors tailored to specific tumour neoantigens, further exemplifies the shift towards personalized oncology. This precision approach, however, requires robust bioinformatics tools and ethical considerations regarding data privacy and access to advanced technologies.
