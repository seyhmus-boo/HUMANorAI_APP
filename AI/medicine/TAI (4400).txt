Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant global health concern, with rising prevalence rates observed across various diagnoses in recent decades. Historically, understanding of these conditions lagged behind adult counterparts, often characterized by simplistic or stigmatizing frameworks.  Early approaches focused primarily on institutionalization and limited pharmacological interventions. However, the latter half of the 20th century witnessed a paradigm shift towards community-based care and a burgeoning understanding of developmental psychopathology.  Current trends reveal a concerning increase in anxiety and depression, particularly amongst girls, alongside persistent challenges with substance use disorders and eating disorders.  Effective treatments increasingly integrate evidence-based psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), alongside pharmacotherapy tailored to individual needs and developmental stage.  While advances in neurobiological research enhance our understanding of underlying mechanisms, significant gaps remain in early intervention and access to quality care, particularly in underserved populations.  Future research priorities should focus on improving preventative strategies, enhancing accessibility to evidence-based interventions, and reducing the persistent stigma surrounding adolescent mental health.
