Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, yet its evolution continues to be driven by the pursuit of enhanced precision, reduced invasiveness, and improved patient outcomes.  This necessitates ongoing advancements in instrumentation, imaging, and surgical techniques.  Experimental challenges in MIS research encompass the development and validation of novel instruments capable of dexterity and force feedback comparable to open surgery within confined spaces.  Reproducing the complex biomechanics of tissue interaction in *in vitro* models remains a significant hurdle, particularly when assessing the effects of novel energy sources or robotic manipulation.  Furthermore,  translating promising results from benchtop studies to *in vivo* models and ultimately clinical trials presents considerable difficulties.  Challenges related to  image-guided navigation, particularly in real-time tracking of dynamic tissues and precise instrument placement, require innovative approaches in computational imaging and sensor technology.  Finally, the rigorous evaluation of long-term outcomes and the establishment of standardized metrics for comparing different MIS techniques remain critical areas requiring further development. Overcoming these experimental challenges is crucial to unlocking the full potential of MIS and accelerating the evolution of safer, more effective surgical procedures.
