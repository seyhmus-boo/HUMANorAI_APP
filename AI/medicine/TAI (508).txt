Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This abstract explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human health outcomes. Rising temperatures exacerbate existing health issues, increasing heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, expanding their geographic ranges and intensifying transmission seasons.  Extreme weather events, such as floods and hurricanes, cause direct injuries and fatalities, while also disrupting healthcare infrastructure and sanitation systems, leading to outbreaks of waterborne diseases.  Furthermore, climate change impacts food security and water availability, contributing to malnutrition and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases.  Indirect effects include mental health impacts related to displacement, loss of livelihood, and increased stress from climate-related disasters.  Addressing the public health consequences of climate change requires a multi-sectoral approach involving mitigation strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adaptation measures to build resilience within healthcare systems and vulnerable communities.  Future research should prioritize the development of effective early warning systems and targeted interventions to minimize the escalating health burden associated with a changing climate.
