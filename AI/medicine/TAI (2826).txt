Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, prioritizing smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster patient recovery.  This presentation will trace the evolution of MIS, from early laparoscopic approaches to the sophisticated robotic and image-guided procedures prevalent today. We will explore key milestones, including the development of advanced instrumentation, improved visualization technologies such as 3D laparoscopy and augmented reality overlays, and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI).  Recent advancements in robotic surgery, such as single-port access and improved dexterity, will be discussed, highlighting their impact on surgical precision and outcomes.  Furthermore, the increasing use of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and its challenges will be briefly reviewed.  Finally, we will examine the ongoing integration of data analytics and machine learning into MIS, enabling predictive modeling of surgical outcomes and personalized surgical planning.  The presentation concludes by considering future directions, including the potential of bioprinting and nanotechnology in further minimizing invasiveness and maximizing patient benefit.
