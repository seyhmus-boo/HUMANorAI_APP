Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery times, has revolutionized surgical practice.  This paper explores the significant evolution of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, tracing its development from early pioneering efforts to the sophisticated technologies employed today.  The transition from rudimentary approaches to the current landscape of advanced laparoscopy, robotic surgery, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) represents a dramatic shift in surgical capabilities.  We will analyze the key technological advancements that have driven this evolution, focusing on the development of specialized instruments, imaging systems, and surgical platforms.  Furthermore, we will examine the impact of these improved techniques on a range of surgical specialties, including general surgery, urology, gynecology, and cardiac surgery. Practical applications discussed will encompass improved patient outcomes, reduced hospital stays, decreased post-operative complications, and enhanced surgical precision in complex procedures. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the transformative journey of MIS techniques and their substantial contributions to modern healthcare.
