Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transition, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and development of mental health disorders.  This paper examines contemporary trends in adolescent mental health, focusing on the rising prevalence of conditions such as anxiety, depression, and substance abuse disorders.  The escalating rates necessitate a comprehensive understanding of contributing factors, ranging from genetic predispositions and environmental stressors to the impact of social media and cultural influences.  However, simply identifying trends is insufficient; effective treatment requires a fundamentally interdisciplinary approach.  This research explores the crucial interplay between psychiatry, psychology, social work, and neuroscience in developing and implementing holistic interventions. We will analyze the efficacy of various therapeutic modalities, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), pharmacotherapy, and family-based interventions, highlighting the benefits of integrated care models that leverage the unique expertise of each discipline.  Ultimately, this paper advocates for a collaborative, interdisciplinary framework to address the complex challenges presented by adolescent mental health disorders and promote positive long-term outcomes.
