Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine and public health.  This presentation will focus on the experimental challenges inherent in researching and combating this complex phenomenon.  Current approaches, while yielding valuable insights, are hampered by limitations in accurately modeling the diverse microbial communities involved in AR development and transmission.  Specifically, the in vitro methodologies frequently employed fail to capture the dynamic interplay between bacterial populations, host immune responses, and environmental factors within the complex ecosystems of the human gut and other niches.  Furthermore, translating promising in vitro findings to in vivo settings, including human clinical trials, remains challenging due to the heterogeneity of AR mechanisms, patient populations, and infection types.  This leads to difficulties in predicting the efficacy and safety of novel therapeutic strategies.  We will explore the need for improved experimental models, including advanced in vitro systems that mimic the complexity of infection sites and the development of robust preclinical models that accurately reflect human pathogenesis.  Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial to developing effective interventions and mitigating the escalating global crisis of antibiotic resistance.
