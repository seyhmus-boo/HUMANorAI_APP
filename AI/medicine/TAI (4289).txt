This presentation examines evolving trends in adolescent mental health disorders and their treatments.  Historically, adolescent mental health was largely overlooked, often conflated with typical developmental challenges.  However, recent decades have witnessed a significant rise in diagnoses of anxiety, depression, and self-harm, particularly among girls.  This increase is likely multifactorial, influenced by societal pressures, technological advancements, and evolving diagnostic criteria.

The presentation will explore these contributing factors, drawing upon epidemiological data illustrating changing prevalence rates across various disorders. We will examine the limitations of historical treatment approaches, which often lacked adolescent-specific considerations, and contrast them with contemporary evidence-based interventions.  This includes discussion of pharmacological treatments, psychotherapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and the growing importance of integrated care models emphasizing holistic support.  Finally, the presentation will address future directions in research and treatment, highlighting the need for early intervention strategies, improved access to care, and culturally sensitive approaches to address the disparities in mental health outcomes among adolescents.
