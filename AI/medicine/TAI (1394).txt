Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, demanding innovative solutions beyond traditional approaches.  This abstract explores the potential of quantum mechanical (QM) methods to contribute to combating AR. While classical methods struggle to accurately model the complex interactions within antibiotic-protein complexes, QM techniques, particularly density functional theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock methods, offer the prospect of highly accurate predictions of binding affinities and reaction mechanisms.  This allows for detailed investigation of subtle structural variations influencing antibiotic efficacy and resistance mechanisms, including mutations in target proteins and the impact of surrounding solvent environments.  Furthermore, QM simulations can accelerate the *in silico* screening of novel antibiotic candidates and guide the design of molecules that circumvent resistance mechanisms.  Specifically, QM calculations can identify key interactions contributing to binding specificity and explore the feasibility of modifying existing antibiotics to restore their effectiveness against resistant strains.  The integration of QM with machine learning approaches holds further promise for high-throughput screening and the development of predictive models for AR development.  While computational costs remain a challenge, advancements in QM algorithms and computing power suggest a growing role for QM in addressing this urgent global issue.
