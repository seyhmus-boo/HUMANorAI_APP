Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health globally.  This abstract summarizes the established and emerging links between a changing climate and human health outcomes.  Rising temperatures directly increase heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever, while extreme weather events like floods and droughts exacerbate malnutrition and displacement, increasing the risk of infectious diseases and mental health issues.  Air pollution, worsened by climate change, is linked to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  Furthermore, alterations in agricultural yields and food security impact nutritional status, increasing susceptibility to illness.  Existing health inequalities are exacerbated, with disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and marginalized groups.  Mitigation and adaptation strategies are crucial; these include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, strengthening public health infrastructure, improving early warning systems for extreme weather events, and promoting climate-resilient healthcare systems.  Interdisciplinary research and collaborative action are paramount to address this complex and urgent public health challenge.
