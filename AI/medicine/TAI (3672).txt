Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting key technological advancements and their impact on surgical approaches.  Early laparoscopic techniques, initially limited by two-dimensional visualization and instrument manipulation challenges, are contrasted with contemporary advancements.  The introduction of robotic-assisted surgery, with its enhanced dexterity and three-dimensional visualization, significantly expanded the scope of MIS.  We explore the parallel development of novel energy sources, including ultrasonic and bipolar technologies, and their contribution to improved precision and hemostasis.  Furthermore, the integration of advanced imaging modalities, such as intraoperative fluorescence imaging and augmented reality, is discussed in relation to improved surgical planning and execution.  The presentation concludes by examining future directions in MIS, including single-port surgery, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), and the potential of artificial intelligence for surgical assistance, emphasizing the ongoing pursuit of ever-minimally invasive and precise surgical interventions.
