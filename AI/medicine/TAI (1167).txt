Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant global public health concern, with increasing prevalence observed over recent decades. Historically, adolescent mental health received limited attention, often conflated with normal developmental transitions.  However, advancements in diagnostic criteria, epidemiological research methodologies, and a growing recognition of the long-term impact of untreated conditions have spurred increased investigation.  Current trends indicate rising rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm, particularly amongst girls and marginalized populations.  These trends are likely multifactorial, influenced by societal factors such as increased academic pressure, social media usage, and socioeconomic disparities.  Treatment approaches have evolved from primarily psychodynamic therapies to incorporate evidence-based interventions like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and medication, often in integrated models.  However, access to timely and appropriate care remains a considerable challenge, especially in low-resource settings. Future research should focus on understanding the interplay of biological, psychological, and social determinants of adolescent mental health to develop effective prevention and intervention strategies, promoting early identification and reducing the long-term morbidity associated with these disorders.
