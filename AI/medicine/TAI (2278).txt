Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This presentation traces the evolution of MIS, highlighting the critical role of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving its advancements.  Early MIS relied heavily on advancements in endoscopy and laparoscopy, but subsequent progress has been significantly fueled by collaborations between surgeons, engineers, and imaging specialists. We will explore the synergistic effect of innovations in robotics (e.g., da Vinci system), advanced imaging modalities (e.g., 3D imaging, fluorescence imaging), and materials science (e.g., biocompatible sutures and adhesives) on the refinement of surgical techniques.  The presentation will analyze how these interdisciplinary links have led to the development of novel approaches like single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), and how they continue to shape the future of MIS.  Furthermore, we will discuss the ongoing challenges and future directions, particularly in the development of AI-assisted surgical navigation and personalized surgical approaches, emphasizing the continued necessity for robust interdisciplinary partnerships to achieve optimal patient care.
