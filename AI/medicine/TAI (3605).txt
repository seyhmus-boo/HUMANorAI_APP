Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding interdisciplinary collaboration for effective navigation. This presentation will explore the key ethical dilemmas arising within this critical area of medicine.  We will examine the tension between the utilitarian principle of maximizing benefit and the deontological imperative to respect individual autonomy, focusing on the challenges of equitable allocation and the potential for coercion or exploitation of vulnerable donors.  The presentation will highlight the crucial interplay between medical professionals, ethicists, legal scholars, and social scientists in addressing these issues.  Specifically, we will discuss the role of bioethics in establishing fair allocation protocols, the legal frameworks surrounding informed consent and organ procurement, and the sociological factors influencing donor registration and organ donation rates within different populations.  By examining the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, this presentation aims to illuminate the multifaceted ethical landscape of organ transplantation and advocate for a more robust and ethically sound system, fostering improved outcomes for both recipients and potential donors.  The need for ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue and research will be emphasized as crucial for ensuring equitable and just practices in this life-saving field.
