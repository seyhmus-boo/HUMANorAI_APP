Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding ongoing scrutiny.  This presentation will explore key ethical dilemmas arising from the inherent scarcity of transplantable organs. We will examine the principles of justice and fairness in allocation, addressing issues of prioritization based on factors such as medical urgency, age, lifestyle, and socioeconomic status.  The tension between maximizing overall benefit and prioritizing individual needs will be critically analyzed,  considering both utilitarian and deontological approaches.  Furthermore, we will discuss the ethical implications of live organ donation, including informed consent, potential coercion, and the vulnerability of donors, particularly in contexts of familial pressure or economic incentives.  Finally, we will examine the practical applications of these ethical frameworks, including the role of transparent allocation algorithms, the development of robust consent protocols, and the implementation of effective safeguards to protect vulnerable populations.  The presentation aims to stimulate discussion and contribute towards more just and equitable organ allocation systems.
