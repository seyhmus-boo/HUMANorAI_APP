Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of MIS techniques, from early laparoscopic approaches to the sophisticated robotic and image-guided procedures available today. We will explore the key technological advancements that have driven this evolution, including the refinement of endoscopic instrumentation, the development of advanced imaging modalities such as 3D laparoscopy and fluorescence imaging, and the integration of robotic platforms offering enhanced dexterity and precision.  Recent developments in single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) will also be discussed, representing a further push towards minimally invasive approaches with reduced scarring.  The presentation will further analyze the impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning on procedural planning and execution, focusing on areas like predictive analytics for patient selection and intraoperative guidance systems. Finally, we will consider the ongoing challenges and future directions of MIS, including the need for improved training and standardization to ensure the widespread adoption and optimization of these techniques across diverse surgical specialties.
