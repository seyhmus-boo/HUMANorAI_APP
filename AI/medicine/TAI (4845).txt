Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIS) have revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  However, the evolution of these techniques has been fraught with significant experimental challenges. This presentation will explore the key obstacles encountered in translating novel MIS approaches from the laboratory to the clinical setting.  We will focus on three primary areas: (1) the development and validation of miniature surgical instruments and robotic systems, including issues of dexterity, precision, and haptic feedback; (2) the limitations of current imaging modalities in providing real-time visualization during complex MIS procedures, and the experimental hurdles in developing enhanced imaging technologies; and (3) the challenges associated with in vivo testing and validation of new MIS techniques, particularly the ethical considerations and the difficulty in replicating the complex physiological conditions of the operating theatre in preclinical models.  We will conclude by highlighting promising avenues of research addressing these limitations, emphasizing the critical role of interdisciplinary collaboration in accelerating the progress of MIS and ultimately improving patient care.
