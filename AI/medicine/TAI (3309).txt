Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents significant challenges to developing truly personalized medicine. While genomic sequencing has revolutionized our understanding of oncogenesis, translating this knowledge into effective, targeted therapies remains hampered by several experimental hurdles. This presentation will discuss key challenges in leveraging genomic information for personalized cancer care.  We will explore the limitations of current sequencing technologies in detecting low-frequency mutations and complex genomic rearrangements, crucial for identifying actionable targets in diverse tumor subtypes.  Furthermore, the significant inter- and intra-tumor heterogeneity necessitates the development of more sophisticated spatial and temporal sampling techniques to accurately reflect the genomic landscape.  The difficulty in modelling the complex interplay between genetic alterations and the tumor microenvironment in preclinical settings will also be addressed, highlighting the need for improved *in vitro* and *in vivo* models that accurately mimic human tumor biology.  Finally, the ethical considerations and challenges surrounding data management and accessibility for large-scale genomic studies will be briefly discussed.  Addressing these experimental challenges is paramount to realizing the full potential of personalized oncology and improving patient outcomes.
