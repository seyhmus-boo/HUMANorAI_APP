Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, jeopardizing the efficacy of antimicrobial treatments for infectious diseases.  The widespread use and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture have driven the selection and dissemination of resistant microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and parasites.  This has led to increased morbidity, mortality, prolonged hospital stays, and higher healthcare costs globally.  The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens, particularly Gram-negative bacteria, is particularly alarming, limiting treatment options for severe infections.  The impact extends beyond healthcare, affecting food security through reduced animal productivity and increased risk of zoonotic infections.  Effective strategies to combat AR require a multi-faceted approach, including optimizing antibiotic stewardship programs, developing novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapies, improving sanitation and hygiene practices, and promoting responsible antibiotic use across all sectors.  International collaboration and strengthened surveillance systems are crucial for monitoring resistance patterns and informing effective public health interventions to mitigate the devastating global implications of AR.  Failure to address this crisis will severely compromise healthcare systems and global development.
