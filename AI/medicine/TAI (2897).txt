Historically, adolescent mental health disorders were often overlooked or misattributed to typical teenage angst, resulting in significant underdiagnosis and undertreatment.  However, recent decades have witnessed a marked increase in recognition of the prevalence and severity of conditions such as anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use disorders in this population.  Trends indicate a rising incidence, potentially influenced by factors such as increased academic pressures, social media's impact on self-esteem and social comparison, and broader societal stressors.  While traditional psychotherapeutic approaches like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and psychodynamic therapy remain cornerstones of treatment,  modern interventions increasingly incorporate evidence-based modalities like Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) for managing emotional dysregulation and Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) for fostering psychological flexibility.  Furthermore, advancements in psychopharmacology have led to the development of medications specifically targeted at adolescent-specific presentations of these disorders, although their use often requires careful consideration of potential side effects and developmental implications.  Early identification and intervention are crucial in improving long-term outcomes, highlighting the need for increased access to comprehensive mental healthcare services tailored to the unique needs of adolescents.
