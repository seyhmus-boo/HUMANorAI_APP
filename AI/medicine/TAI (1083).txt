Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare, with significant implications for diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. This paper investigates the multifaceted impact of AI on diagnostics across various medical specialties.  While traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on human expertise, often leading to variability and potential delays, AI offers the potential for enhanced speed, precision, and objectivity.  We examine the application of machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning, in image analysis (radiology, pathology, dermatology), signal processing (cardiology, neurology), and genomic analysis, highlighting their ability to detect subtle patterns and anomalies often missed by the human eye.  This review explores the current state-of-the-art, analysing both the benefits – including improved diagnostic accuracy, earlier disease detection, and personalized medicine – and the challenges – encompassing data bias, algorithm explainability, regulatory hurdles, and ethical considerations regarding clinical responsibility and patient autonomy.  Ultimately, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of AI's transformative potential in healthcare diagnostics while acknowledging the critical issues that must be addressed for responsible and effective implementation.
