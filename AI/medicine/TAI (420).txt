Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with issues dismissed as "teenage angst." However, recent decades have witnessed a surge in research highlighting the prevalence and severity of mental health disorders in this population.  Trends indicate rising rates of anxiety and depression, particularly amongst girls, alongside increasing diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and eating disorders.  Contributing factors include societal pressures, technological advancements, and shifting family structures.  

Treatment approaches have evolved significantly.  Historically, institutionalization was prevalent, now largely replaced by evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).  Pharmacological interventions, while controversial, play a role in managing severe symptoms, particularly in cases of depression and anxiety.  Early intervention and integrated care models, encompassing family therapy and school-based support, are increasingly recognized as crucial for effective and sustainable outcomes.  Further research focusing on preventative strategies and culturally sensitive treatments is vital to address this growing public health concern.
