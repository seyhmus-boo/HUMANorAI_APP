Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, driven by technological advancements and a growing emphasis on patient-centered care. This presentation will trace the key milestones in this evolution, highlighting the transition from early laparoscopic approaches to the sophisticated robotic and image-guided techniques employed today.  We will explore the initial limitations of MIS, such as restricted dexterity and visualization, and examine how innovations such as improved instrumentation, high-definition cameras, and 3D visualization have overcome these hurdles.  The integration of robotic surgery, offering enhanced precision and control, will be discussed, alongside the increasing adoption of single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) aiming for even less invasive approaches.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the impact of advanced imaging modalities, such as fluorescence imaging and augmented reality, on surgical planning and intraoperative decision-making.  Finally, we will consider the future directions of MIS, focusing on artificial intelligence, personalized medicine, and the potential for fully automated procedures, emphasizing the ongoing pursuit of improved surgical outcomes and enhanced patient recovery.
