The genetic basis of cancer has revolutionized oncology, transitioning from a largely descriptive field to one of precision medicine.  Early research, focusing on chromosomal abnormalities like the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia, laid the groundwork for understanding cancer's genetic heterogeneity. This initial work highlighted the potential for targeted therapies, a paradigm shift from broad-spectrum cytotoxic agents.

Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies, including whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, have dramatically increased our understanding of the mutational landscape across various cancer types. This has enabled the identification of driver mutations, crucial for cancer initiation and progression, and passenger mutations, which are less impactful.  This wealth of genomic data fuels the development of personalized medicine, allowing for tailored treatment strategies based on a patient's unique genetic profile.

This presentation will explore the historical evolution of our understanding of cancer genetics, focusing on key discoveries and technological advancements that have paved the way for personalized cancer therapy.  We will discuss the challenges and limitations of current approaches, including the complexities of tumour heterogeneity and the need for robust predictive biomarkers.  Finally, we will briefly outline future directions in the field, focusing on the potential of liquid biopsies and advanced computational modelling to further refine personalized cancer treatment.
