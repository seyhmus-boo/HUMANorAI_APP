Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, extending beyond the traditionally recognized impacts.  This paper explores the complex and evolving relationship between these two critical issues, focusing on recent developments in understanding and mitigating the associated risks. While established links between extreme weather events and immediate health consequences, such as heatstroke and the spread of vector-borne diseases, are well-documented,  research increasingly emphasizes the subtle yet pervasive impacts of a changing climate.  Recent studies highlight the growing concern around the mental health implications of climate-related disasters and displacement, alongside the escalating challenges posed by air pollution exacerbated by climate-driven wildfires and changes in agricultural practices.  Moreover,  the development of novel epidemiological modelling techniques and the integration of big data analytics are offering more nuanced assessments of climate change's influence on disease burden and health inequalities.  This paper will examine these emergent areas of investigation, analyze the latest scientific evidence, and discuss implications for public health policy and interventions necessary to build climate-resilient health systems.
