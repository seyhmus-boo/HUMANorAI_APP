Organ transplantation, while life-saving, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  Central to these is the allocation of scarce organs, often necessitating complex criteria balancing medical urgency, prognosis, and potential benefit.  Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) for predictive modeling raise concerns about potential bias in algorithmic prioritization, potentially disadvantaging certain demographic groups.  Furthermore, the expansion of living donation, while offering increased organ availability, necessitates rigorous informed consent processes to safeguard against coercion or exploitation, particularly in vulnerable populations.  The increasing use of xenotransplantation (animal-to-human transplantation) introduces novel ethical challenges regarding animal welfare and the potential transmission of zoonotic diseases.  Finally, the equitable access to transplantation across socioeconomic strata remains a significant issue, demanding policy interventions to prevent disparities based on wealth and insurance coverage.  Ongoing research must focus on mitigating these challenges and promoting ethically sound practices within this vital medical field.
