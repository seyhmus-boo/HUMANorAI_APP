The escalating global crisis of antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant threat to public health and sustainable development.  Driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal healthcare, agriculture, and aquaculture, AR is leading to a resurgence of previously treatable infections, causing increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs worldwide.  The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly Gram-negative bacteria and certain fungi, necessitates urgent action.  This resistance undermines the efficacy of established treatment regimens, jeopardizing surgical procedures, cancer therapies, and organ transplantation.  The global implications extend beyond healthcare, impacting economic productivity through lost workdays and escalating healthcare expenditures.  Furthermore, the lack of new antibiotic development pipelines exacerbates the challenge, necessitating a multifaceted approach involving improved stewardship programs, infection prevention and control measures, accelerated research and development of novel antimicrobials and alternative therapies, and strengthened global surveillance systems to monitor resistance patterns and inform effective interventions.  Failure to address AR effectively will have profound and potentially catastrophic consequences for global health security and socio-economic stability.
