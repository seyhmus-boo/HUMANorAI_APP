Telemedicine has rapidly evolved, transforming modern healthcare delivery through enhanced accessibility and efficiency. Recent advancements in technology, including high-bandwidth internet access, sophisticated mobile applications, and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered diagnostic tools, have significantly broadened telemedicine's capabilities.  This abstract examines its expanding role, encompassing remote patient monitoring (RPM), virtual consultations, and telehealth-enabled mental health services.  Studies consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of telemedicine in managing chronic conditions, such as diabetes and hypertension, improving patient adherence to treatment plans and reducing hospital readmissions.  Furthermore, AI integration facilitates early disease detection through image analysis and predictive modelling, potentially revolutionising preventative care. However, challenges persist, including concerns about data security and privacy, disparities in access based on socioeconomic status and technological literacy, and the need for robust regulatory frameworks.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations to fully harness telemedicine's potential for equitable and sustainable healthcare systems.  The integration of telemedicine into established healthcare infrastructure promises to reshape healthcare delivery, fostering a more patient-centric and efficient system.
