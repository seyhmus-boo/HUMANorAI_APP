Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma compared to open surgery, represents a significant advancement in surgical practice.  This paper explores the evolutionary trajectory of surgical techniques within the field of MIS, tracing its development from rudimentary beginnings to the sophisticated technologies employed today.  Early precursors to MIS can be identified in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with advancements such as the development of endoscopes allowing for visualization within the body cavity. However, true progress was hampered by limitations in instrumentation and imaging. The advent of laparoscopy in the mid-20th century marked a pivotal moment, initially utilizing rigid scopes and limited instrumentation. This period saw gradual improvements in camera technology and the introduction of specialized laparoscopic instruments, allowing for more complex procedures. The subsequent rise of robotic surgery, commencing in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, revolutionized the field, offering enhanced dexterity, precision, and three-dimensional visualization. This paper will analyze these key developments, examining the technological innovations that propelled the evolution of MIS, alongside the parallel advancements in surgical training and patient selection criteria that have shaped its widespread adoption and ongoing refinement.  Furthermore, we will consider the future directions of MIS, including emerging technologies and their potential impact on surgical practice.
