The evolution of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques represents a fascinating intersection of macroscopic engineering and the underlying quantum mechanical principles governing matter-interaction at the nanoscale. While not directly employing quantum phenomena in practice, the advancement of MIS hinges on manipulating materials at a level influenced by quantum mechanics.  The development of advanced materials, such as high-strength, biocompatible polymers used in smaller, more flexible instruments, relies heavily on our understanding of atomic bonding and material properties, dictated by quantum mechanics.  Similarly, the precision of laser-assisted procedures, pivotal in MIS, depends on the quantum nature of light and its interaction with tissue at a molecular level.  Improvements in imaging techniques, like enhanced MRI resolution, leverage advancements in quantum-based sensing and signal processing.  Further, the miniaturization of robotic surgical systems, crucial for accessing confined anatomical sites, is intrinsically linked to the quantum mechanical limitations on device size and power consumption.  While macroscopic principles dominate the design and implementation of MIS, this review highlights the indirect yet pervasive influence of quantum mechanics on the remarkable progress in this field, paving the way for even less invasive and more effective surgical interventions in the future.
