Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the burgeoning field of personalized oncology, driven by advancements in understanding the genetic basis of cancer.  Cancer, once viewed as a monolithic disease, is now recognized as a collection of genetically distinct subtypes, each with its unique molecular drivers.  Next-generation sequencing allows us to comprehensively profile a patient's tumor, identifying specific mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, and epigenetic alterations. This genetic blueprint informs targeted therapies.

For example, the presence of *EGFR* mutations in lung cancer dictates the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, demonstrating remarkable efficacy compared to traditional chemotherapy. Similarly, identification of *HER2* amplification in breast cancer guides treatment with HER2-targeted agents like trastuzumab. This precision medicine approach minimizes side effects associated with broad-spectrum therapies, improving patient outcomes and quality of life.  Ongoing research focuses on integrating genomic data with other omics information, such as proteomics and metabolomics, to further refine therapeutic strategies and develop novel treatment modalities, truly personalizing cancer care.
