Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant global health concern, with rising prevalence rates observed across numerous diagnoses in recent decades.  Historically, adolescent mental health received limited attention, often overshadowed by adult-focused paradigms and hampered by a lack of age-appropriate diagnostic tools and treatment approaches.  Early conceptualizations emphasized biological factors or family dynamics, neglecting the crucial interplay of societal influences, peer relationships, and developmental trajectories.  Recent epidemiological studies employing standardized assessments reveal escalating rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors, particularly among girls.  Contributing factors include increased academic pressure, social media usage, and broader societal changes. Treatment approaches have evolved, shifting from predominantly psychodynamic methods to evidence-based interventions, including cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacology, tailored to adolescent developmental stages and needs.  However, access to appropriate care remains a significant barrier, highlighting the need for improved early intervention strategies, enhanced community-based services, and further research to elucidate the complex etiology and optimize treatment efficacy for this vulnerable population.
