Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting crucial cellular processes.  Advances in genomics have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, revealing diverse driver mutations across various cancer types.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies now enable comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, identifying specific mutations informing prognosis and guiding targeted therapies.  This knowledge fuels the development of personalized medicine, tailoring treatment to an individual's unique tumor genetic profile.  For example, identifying EGFR mutations in lung cancer allows for effective treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while detection of HER2 amplification in breast cancer dictates the use of HER2-targeted therapies like trastuzumab.  Furthermore,  immunotherapy approaches, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are being refined based on genomic data, identifying patients most likely to respond based on tumor mutational burden or specific neoantigen profiles.  Ongoing research focuses on integrating multi-omics data, including transcriptomics and proteomics, to further refine predictive biomarkers and improve the efficacy and precision of personalized cancer therapies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing treatment toxicity.
