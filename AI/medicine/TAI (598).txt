Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health.  This lecture explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human well-being, highlighting key pathways of impact.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased morbidity and mortality from heatstroke and cardiovascular diseases, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns exacerbate the risk of waterborne diseases and vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever through altered breeding grounds and disease transmission dynamics.  Extreme weather events, including floods and droughts, displace populations, disrupt healthcare infrastructure, and contribute to food insecurity, all of which negatively impact physical and mental health outcomes.  Furthermore, air pollution, exacerbated by climate change, worsens respiratory illnesses and cardiovascular conditions.  Addressing climate change is therefore not merely an environmental imperative, but a critical public health priority demanding comprehensive mitigation and adaptation strategies to protect vulnerable populations and ensure health equity in the face of a rapidly changing climate.  Further research is needed to fully quantify these impacts and develop targeted interventions.
