Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has undergone significant expansion in recent years, fundamentally altering modern healthcare delivery.  Driven by technological advancements and increasing patient demand, telemedicine now encompasses a broad spectrum of services, from asynchronous store-and-forward consultations (e.g., image sharing for diagnosis) to real-time synchronous video conferencing for virtual consultations.  Recent developments include the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) for improved diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment plans, as well as the deployment of wearable sensors for continuous remote patient monitoring.  These technological advancements enable proactive healthcare management, facilitating early intervention and reducing hospital readmission rates.  Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically accelerated the adoption of telemedicine, demonstrating its efficacy in mitigating risks associated with in-person consultations and extending healthcare access to geographically isolated or underserved populations.  While challenges remain, particularly concerning regulatory frameworks, data security, and equitable access to technology, telemedicine's ongoing evolution promises to further enhance the efficiency, accessibility, and quality of healthcare across diverse settings.
