The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Early research, focusing on identifying oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes like *p53*, laid the groundwork for understanding the molecular mechanisms driving carcinogenesis.  This foundational knowledge, gleaned from studies of familial cancers and chromosomal abnormalities, provided the initial impetus for targeted therapies.  However, the complexity of cancer's heterogeneity presented significant challenges.

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing have dramatically expanded our capacity to characterize the unique mutational landscape of individual tumors. This has fueled the development of precision oncology, enabling the identification of specific driver mutations informing the selection of targeted therapies like kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy.  While significant progress has been made, challenges remain.  The high cost of genomic sequencing, the identification of actionable mutations in a subset of cancers, and the emergence of drug resistance highlight the need for ongoing research. Despite these limitations, the integration of genetic information into cancer diagnosis and treatment represents a crucial step towards a more effective and personalized approach to cancer care.
