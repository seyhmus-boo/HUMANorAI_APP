Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to understand and mitigate its impacts. This presentation explores the complex relationship between a changing climate and human well-being, highlighting key interdisciplinary linkages.  We will examine how rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses, while altered precipitation patterns influence the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and Zika.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the impact of extreme weather events – floods, droughts, and wildfires – on mental health, respiratory illnesses, and the displacement of populations, increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases and malnutrition.  

The crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration, encompassing epidemiology, climatology, sociology, and public health policy, will be emphasized. We will explore how integrating climate projections with health vulnerability assessments can inform effective adaptation strategies.  Finally, the presentation will advocate for a holistic approach, stressing the need for integrated research, policy development, and community engagement to build climate-resilient health systems and ensure equitable access to healthcare amidst a changing climate.  This necessitates breaking down disciplinary silos and fostering collaboration across various sectors to effectively address this pressing global challenge.
