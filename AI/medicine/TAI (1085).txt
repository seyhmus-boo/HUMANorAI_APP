Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.  This abstract highlights the crucial interconnections between climate science, epidemiology, social sciences, and public health policy in understanding and addressing this complex challenge.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns exacerbate waterborne diseases and vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever, impacting disease distribution and incidence.  Extreme weather events, amplified by climate change, lead to injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences.  Furthermore, agricultural disruptions caused by climate variability threaten food security and nutritional status, increasing malnutrition and impacting child development.  Social determinants of health, including socioeconomic disparities and access to healthcare, significantly influence vulnerability to climate-related health impacts.  Effective responses require integrating climate projections into public health surveillance, developing early warning systems for climate-sensitive diseases, and implementing equitable adaptation strategies that consider social vulnerability and promote climate-resilient healthcare infrastructure.  Interdisciplinary collaboration is paramount to effectively addressing this critical global challenge and protecting population health.
