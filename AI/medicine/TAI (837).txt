Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health.  This lecture explores the intricate relationship between a changing climate and human health outcomes. Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns exacerbate the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, expanding their geographical range and intensifying transmission.  Furthermore, extreme weather events, such as floods and droughts, disrupt essential services, displace populations, and increase the risk of injuries, malnutrition, and mental health issues.  Indirect effects include altered air quality, leading to respiratory illnesses, and the potential for food insecurity and nutritional deficiencies due to compromised agricultural yields.  Addressing climate change is therefore not merely an environmental imperative but a critical public health priority requiring integrated strategies that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions while building climate resilience within healthcare systems.  This necessitates a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach involving policymakers, healthcare professionals, and the wider community.
