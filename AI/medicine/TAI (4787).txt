Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting escalating prevalence rates globally.  Trends indicate a rise in anxiety and depression, often exacerbated by societal factors like social media pressure and academic stress.  Eating disorders and substance abuse also remain prevalent, frequently comorbid with other conditions.  Effective treatment necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, recognizing the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social influences.  Psychiatrists provide pharmacological interventions, targeting neurotransmitter imbalances underlying conditions like depression.  Psychologists offer evidence-based therapies such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), addressing maladaptive thought patterns and emotional regulation.  Social workers contribute by addressing family dynamics, socio-economic factors, and access to support systems.  Furthermore, school counselors play a crucial role in early identification and intervention, fostering a supportive school environment.  This collaborative model, integrating expertise across disciplines, optimizes treatment outcomes by targeting multiple contributing factors and enhancing the adolescent's overall well-being.  Future research should focus on early identification strategies and culturally sensitive interventions to address disparities in access to care.
