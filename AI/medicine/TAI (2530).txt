Organ transplantation, a life-saving medical intervention, presents profound ethical dilemmas, particularly within the context of experimental procedures. This presentation explores the critical ethical challenges arising from the intersection of experimental innovation and organ transplantation.  We will examine the complexities of informed consent when novel techniques, such as xenotransplantation or 3D-bioprinted organs, are involved, particularly concerning the potential for unknown risks and long-term consequences.  The presentation further addresses the equitable allocation of scarce experimental resources, highlighting potential biases and the need for transparent and just distribution strategies.  We will also discuss the ethical implications of using animal models in xenotransplantation, balancing the potential for life-saving breakthroughs against animal welfare concerns.  Finally,  we will consider the evolving regulatory landscape and the crucial role of ethical review boards in navigating the moral complexities inherent in experimental organ transplantation research, advocating for a robust framework ensuring both scientific advancement and the protection of vulnerable populations.
