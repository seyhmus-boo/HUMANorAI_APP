While classical genetics predominantly explains cancer through somatic mutations and epigenetic alterations influencing gene expression, a quantum mechanical perspective offers a nuanced understanding, particularly in the context of personalized medicine.  Quantum entanglement and tunneling phenomena, though not directly causative of cancer, may influence crucial biological processes relevant to oncogenesis.  For example,  electron transfer in redox reactions vital for DNA repair mechanisms could be affected by quantum tunneling, impacting mutation rates and influencing cancer susceptibility.  Furthermore, the conformational changes in proteins, crucial for signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and apoptosis, may exhibit quantum coherence effects, thereby influencing the efficacy of targeted therapies.  Advances in personalized medicine utilize this understanding by analyzing an individual's genomic profile to predict the likelihood of specific mutations and the potential responsiveness to quantum-mechanically influenced therapies.  This includes predicting the efficacy of drugs targeting specific protein conformations or assessing the probability of successful DNA repair based on subtle quantum effects.  Although still in its nascent stages, integrating quantum mechanical principles offers a powerful avenue for enhancing the precision and efficacy of personalized cancer treatments.
