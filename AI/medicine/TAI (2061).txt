The relationship between climate change and public health is complex and increasingly critical.  Historically, climate variations have influenced disease patterns; for example, warmer temperatures and increased rainfall have facilitated the spread of vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever.  However, anthropogenic climate change exacerbates these existing risks through intensified weather events and shifting ecological zones.  Increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves directly cause heatstroke and exacerbate cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses, particularly in vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns impact waterborne disease prevalence, while sea-level rise increases the risk of flooding and displacement, leading to mental health issues and infectious disease outbreaks.  Furthermore, altered agricultural yields due to climate change impact food security and nutrition, contributing to malnutrition and associated health problems.  The cumulative effects pose a significant threat to global public health, requiring proactive mitigation and adaptation strategies encompassing both climate change policies and robust public health infrastructure.  Ignoring this interconnectedness will lead to escalating health burdens in the coming decades.
