Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, driven by continuous advancements in instrumentation, imaging, and surgical techniques.  This abstract reviews the evolutionary trajectory of MIS, highlighting key milestones and ongoing developments. Early laparoscopic procedures, initially limited by technical challenges such as poor visualization and dexterity, spurred innovation in endoscopic instrumentation, including the development of smaller instruments, improved optics, and energy sources.  The introduction of robotic surgery significantly enhanced precision and control, overcoming limitations of human hand tremor and improving ergonomics for surgeons.  Concurrent improvements in imaging technologies, such as 3D laparoscopy and fluorescence imaging, further enhanced visualization and tissue differentiation.  Recently, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-incision laparoscopic surgery (SILS) have sought to minimize surgical trauma even further, although widespread adoption remains challenged by technical complexity.  Future directions include the integration of artificial intelligence for improved surgical planning and real-time assistance, as well as the exploration of novel energy sources and materials.  Ongoing research aims to optimize existing techniques and develop new approaches to further reduce invasiveness, improve patient outcomes, and expand the applicability of MIS across diverse surgical specialties.
