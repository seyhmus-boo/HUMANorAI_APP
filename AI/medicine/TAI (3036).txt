Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine and public health infrastructure.  This presentation will focus on the considerable experimental challenges in tackling AR, highlighting the complexities hindering effective research and development.  We will discuss the limitations of current *in vitro* susceptibility testing, emphasizing the disconnect between laboratory findings and *in vivo* efficacy.  The inherent heterogeneity of bacterial populations and the complex interplay of multiple resistance mechanisms present considerable obstacles in accurately predicting treatment outcomes. Furthermore, the challenge of developing novel antibiotics with effective mechanisms of action is compounded by the high cost and long timelines associated with drug discovery and approval processes.  We will explore the limitations of traditional animal models in replicating human infections, particularly the intricacies of the host-pathogen interaction.  Finally, the ethical and practical challenges associated with large-scale clinical trials for novel antibiotics will be addressed, emphasizing the urgent need for innovative experimental strategies and international collaborations to combat this escalating global health crisis.  These challenges underscore the need for a multidisciplinary approach incorporating novel experimental techniques and a concerted global effort to address the AR threat effectively.
