Organ transplantation, while offering life-saving benefits, presents complex ethical dilemmas.  A central concern revolves around the allocation of scarce organs, necessitating just and equitable distribution systems.  Recent developments highlight the ongoing debate.  Algorithmic approaches, aiming for objective allocation, raise questions regarding algorithmic bias and potential discrimination against certain patient populations.  Furthermore, the increasing use of expanded criteria donors, while expanding the organ pool, necessitates careful evaluation of recipient suitability and potential for graft failure, raising questions of distributive justice.  The ethical implications of living donation, particularly in vulnerable populations where coercion might be a factor, remain a significant focus.  Finally, advancements in xenotransplantation introduce novel challenges concerning animal welfare, the potential for zoonotic diseases, and the ethical permissibility of using animal organs for human transplantation. These emerging areas necessitate ongoing ethical scrutiny and robust regulatory frameworks.
