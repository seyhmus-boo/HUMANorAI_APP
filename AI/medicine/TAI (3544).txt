Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's ability to treat bacterial infections.  The development of AR stems from the evolutionary pressure exerted by antibiotic exposure, favoring the survival and proliferation of resistant strains.  Experimentally investigating AR presents several challenges.  Firstly, accurately modelling the complex interplay of bacterial populations, environmental factors, and antibiotic selective pressures in vivo is difficult.  In vitro studies, while offering controlled environments, may not accurately reflect the dynamics of infection within a host.  Secondly, the identification and characterization of novel resistance mechanisms require sophisticated techniques, such as whole-genome sequencing and advanced proteomic analysis, which can be resource-intensive.  Furthermore, predicting the emergence and spread of resistance, particularly in diverse bacterial populations and geographical contexts, necessitates robust epidemiological models and extensive surveillance programs, facing challenges in data collection and standardization across global settings.  Finally, establishing effective strategies to combat AR necessitates rigorous testing of novel therapies and preventative measures, requiring extensive and ethically sound clinical trials. These experimental complexities contribute significantly to the difficulty in effectively addressing the global crisis of antibiotic resistance.
