Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, driven by continuous advancements in instrumentation, imaging, and surgical techniques. This presentation traces the evolution of MIS, highlighting key milestones and technological shifts that have expanded its application and improved patient outcomes.  Early laparoscopic approaches, initially limited by two-dimensional visualization and cumbersome instrumentation, are contrasted with contemporary techniques employing robotic surgery, single-port access, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).  The transition from rigid to flexible endoscopes, alongside the development of enhanced energy sources (e.g., ultrasonic shears, bipolar forceps), significantly improved precision and dexterity.  Advances in 3D and augmented reality visualization systems have further refined surgical accuracy and reduced operative time. We discuss the ongoing development of artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted surgical navigation and the potential for personalized surgical planning based on pre-operative imaging.  The presentation concludes by examining the challenges and future directions of MIS, including the integration of novel technologies and the ongoing need for rigorous comparative effectiveness research to optimize patient care and establish best practices.
