Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting key regulatory pathways governing cell growth and apoptosis.  Understanding the precise genetic alterations driving individual cancers is crucial for personalized medicine.  While next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows for comprehensive genomic profiling, experimental challenges remain significant.  Firstly, the sheer volume and complexity of genomic data necessitate sophisticated bioinformatics pipelines for accurate variant calling and interpretation.  Filtering out passenger mutations from driver mutations, those causally implicated in tumorigenesis, remains a major hurdle, often requiring integration of multiple omics datasets.  Secondly, functional validation of identified driver mutations is crucial but experimentally demanding.  In vivo models, such as patient-derived xenografts (PDXs), are valuable but can be costly and time-consuming,  and may not perfectly recapitulate the human tumor microenvironment.  Furthermore, intertumoral and intratumoral heterogeneity presents a major challenge, as a single tumor can contain genetically diverse subclones, potentially impacting treatment response and necessitating spatial analysis techniques.  Overcoming these obstacles is critical to translating genomic discoveries into effective personalized cancer therapies.
