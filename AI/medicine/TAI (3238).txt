Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.  This abstract highlights the complex interplay between climate-related events and human health outcomes.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations. Changes in precipitation patterns influence the transmission of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, while extreme weather events like floods and droughts exacerbate malnutrition and mental health issues through displacement and resource scarcity.  Furthermore, climate change impacts agricultural yields, leading to food insecurity and nutritional deficiencies.  Interdisciplinary research, encompassing climatology, epidemiology, public health, sociology, and economics, is crucial to accurately model these complex relationships, predict future health risks, and develop effective interventions.  This includes developing climate-resilient healthcare systems, improving early warning systems for extreme weather events, and implementing public health campaigns targeted at vulnerable communities.  A holistic, interdisciplinary understanding is paramount to mitigating the adverse health impacts of a changing climate and ensuring global health security.
