While not directly governed by quantum mechanics in its macroscopic manifestation, antibiotic resistance presents fascinating parallels at a molecular level.  The efficacy of antibiotics hinges on specific interactions, often involving hydrogen bonding and van der Waals forcesâ€”interactions whose strength and directionality are ultimately rooted in quantum electrodynamics.  Resistance mechanisms, such as enzymatic degradation or efflux pump activity, can be viewed as alterations to the potential energy landscape governing these interactions.  Mutations, at their core, represent changes in the electronic configuration of molecules, subtly altering their quantum mechanical properties and thus their affinity for the antibiotic.  The global implications stem from the probabilistic nature of these molecular alterations:  the emergence and spread of resistant strains are governed by stochastic processes influenced by selection pressures, mirroring quantum mechanical phenomena involving probability distributions. The development of new antibiotics requires a deep understanding of these subtle quantum interactions to design molecules capable of overcoming the constantly evolving resistance landscape.  Furthermore, the computational modelling of drug-target interactions increasingly relies on quantum chemical calculations to predict efficacy and circumvent resistance development.
