Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), a paradigm shift in surgical practice, has evolved dramatically since its inception.  Early attempts, dating back to the late 19th century with the development of endoscopes for diagnostic purposes, were largely limited by technological constraints.  The initial focus was on utilizing rudimentary instruments through small incisions for procedures like laparoscopic cholecystectomies in the 1980s, primarily driven by a desire to reduce postoperative pain and recovery time.  

Subsequent advancements included the incorporation of fibre optics enhancing visualization, the refinement of specialized instruments allowing for dexterity within confined spaces, and the development of sophisticated energy sources like lasers and electrocautery for hemostasis.  The integration of three-dimensional imaging and robotic surgery marked a further leap, offering enhanced precision and control, particularly for complex procedures.  Contemporary trends focus on refining techniques for single-port access, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), and enhanced recovery pathways, consistently minimizing invasiveness and optimizing patient outcomes. This continuous evolution is driven by ongoing technological innovation and a sustained emphasis on improving patient experience and reducing long-term complications.
