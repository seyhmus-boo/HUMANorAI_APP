Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents a significant challenge to developing truly personalized medicine.  While advancements in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling, translating these data into effective therapies remains hampered by several experimental obstacles.  Firstly, identifying driver mutations from a background of passenger mutations necessitates sophisticated bioinformatic analysis and validation, often relying on computationally intensive algorithms and functional assays which are themselves susceptible to biases.  Secondly,  the intricate interplay between multiple mutated genes and the tumour microenvironment is complex and poorly understood, limiting our ability to accurately predict treatment response.  Furthermore, the development of robust preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate the genetic and phenotypic complexity of individual tumours is crucial but remains a major hurdle.  Organoids and patient-derived xenografts offer potential, but lack complete physiological relevance.  Finally, the high cost and logistical challenges associated with NGS and subsequent targeted therapies limit accessibility, hindering the widespread implementation of personalized cancer medicine, particularly in resource-constrained settings.  Overcoming these experimental limitations will be essential for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer therapies.
