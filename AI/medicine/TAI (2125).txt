Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health. This research paper explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human health outcomes, examining both direct and indirect impacts.  Direct effects, such as increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the expansion of vector-borne diseases, and the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to air pollution, are well-documented but their future burden remains uncertain.  Indirect impacts are equally crucial, encompassing factors like food insecurity, water scarcity, displacement and migration leading to mental health issues and social instability.  This study reviews existing literature to synthesize current understanding of these relationships, focusing on the vulnerabilities of specific populations and geographical regions.  Furthermore, it analyzes the efficacy of current adaptation and mitigation strategies, highlighting knowledge gaps and research priorities.  By examining the synergistic effects of climate change on various health determinants, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview informing policy development and public health interventions designed to minimize the adverse health impacts of a changing climate.  A stronger understanding of this dynamic relationship is crucial for effective global health security in the 21st century.
