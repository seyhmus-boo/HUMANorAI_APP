Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using telecommunication technologies, has rapidly evolved from its nascent stages in the 1960s, initially focusing on transmitting medical images for diagnosis.  This presentation explores the significant role telemedicine plays in contemporary healthcare delivery, examining its historical trajectory and its transformative impact on access, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness.  Early applications, limited by bandwidth constraints and technological limitations, primarily served remote or underserved populations.  However, advancements in internet technology, mobile devices, and sophisticated telehealth platforms have broadened its reach and applications significantly.  Today, telemedicine encompasses a wide spectrum of services, including virtual consultations, remote patient monitoring, and telehealth-enabled mental healthcare. We will discuss the benefits of telemedicine, including improved patient access, particularly for those with mobility issues or residing in geographically isolated areas, enhanced patient engagement through remote monitoring, and cost savings through reduced travel and hospital visits.  Furthermore, we will address challenges such as regulatory hurdles, ensuring data security and patient privacy, and bridging the digital divide to ensure equitable access for all.  The presentation will conclude by exploring the future potential of telemedicine in shaping a more accessible, efficient, and patient-centric healthcare system.
