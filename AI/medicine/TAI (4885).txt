Adolescents experience a heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders, with significant shifts in prevalence observed across recent decades.  This lecture will explore emerging trends in adolescent mental health, focusing on rising rates of anxiety and depression,  often exacerbated by societal pressures, social media usage, and academic stress.  We will examine the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to these increases.  Treatment approaches are also evolving, moving beyond traditional therapies.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and mindfulness-based interventions have demonstrated efficacy.  Furthermore, the integration of pharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), must be carefully considered, acknowledging the importance of risk-benefit assessment and close monitoring.  The lecture will conclude by highlighting the crucial need for early intervention, accessible mental health services tailored to adolescent needs, and a reduction of societal stigma to improve outcomes and promote well-being.
