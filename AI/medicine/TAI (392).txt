Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, prioritizing patient outcomes through smaller incisions and reduced trauma. This presentation traces the evolution of MIS techniques, highlighting key advancements that have propelled its expansion across diverse surgical specialties.  Early laparoscopic approaches, initially limited by technical challenges and a steep learning curve, have given way to sophisticated robotic systems offering enhanced dexterity, precision, and visualization.  Recent developments include the integration of advanced imaging modalities, such as augmented reality and 3D fluorescence imaging, which significantly improve surgical accuracy and reduce complications.  Furthermore, the rise of single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) demonstrates a continuous pursuit of minimizing invasiveness. This presentation will analyze the impact of these technological advancements on surgical outcomes, patient recovery times, and healthcare costs.  Finally, we will discuss the ongoing challenges and future directions of MIS, including the integration of artificial intelligence and the development of novel surgical instruments and materials aimed at further optimizing patient care.
