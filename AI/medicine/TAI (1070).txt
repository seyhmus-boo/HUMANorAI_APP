Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have undergone significant evolution since their inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical skills.  Early MIS procedures, primarily laparoscopic, relied on rigid endoscopes and limited instrument articulation, resulting in restricted dexterity and a steep learning curve.  Technological progress introduced flexible endoscopes, robotic-assisted surgery (RAS), and improved energy sources (e.g., ultrasonic shears, LigaSure), enhancing precision and reducing trauma.  RAS, in particular, offers superior dexterity, three-dimensional visualization, and tremor filtration, facilitating complex procedures previously inaccessible via laparoscopy.  Concurrent advancements in imaging, including high-definition cameras, 3D visualization, and fluorescence imaging, have further improved surgical accuracy and real-time tissue assessment.  The emergence of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) represents a further paradigm shift, although its widespread adoption remains limited due to technical challenges.  Future directions include further miniaturization of instrumentation, integration of artificial intelligence for enhanced precision and automation, and personalized surgical planning based on individual patient anatomy.  Ongoing research focuses on mitigating limitations such as prolonged operation times in some RAS procedures and overcoming technical hurdles in NOTES to further optimize patient outcomes and expand the applications of MIS.
