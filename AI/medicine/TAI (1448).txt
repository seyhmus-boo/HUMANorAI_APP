Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, driven by advancements across multiple disciplines.  Early MIS techniques, predominantly laparoscopy, relied on rudimentary instrumentation and two-dimensional visualization, limiting dexterity and precision.  Evolution has been marked by interdisciplinary collaborations, integrating advancements in optics, robotics, and materials science.  The development of high-definition 3D laparoscopy significantly improved surgical visualization, while robotic surgery, leveraging engineering and computer science, enhanced precision and dexterity, particularly in complex procedures.  Concurrent advancements in imaging, including intraoperative ultrasound and fluorescence imaging, provided real-time anatomical information, improving surgical planning and execution.  Furthermore, advancements in biomaterials, such as suture materials and sealants, minimized tissue trauma and improved wound healing.  This interdisciplinary approach has broadened MIS applications across surgical specialties, resulting in reduced patient morbidity and mortality, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times.  Future directions include the integration of artificial intelligence and augmented reality to further enhance surgical precision, training, and patient outcomes, emphasizing the continued importance of interdisciplinary collaboration in shaping the future of MIS.
