Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health.  This lecture explores the intricate relationship between a changing climate and its impact on human well-being.  Rising temperatures directly increase morbidity and mortality through heatstroke and exacerbate pre-existing cardiovascular and respiratory conditions.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, impacting vulnerable populations disproportionately.  Extreme weather events, including floods and droughts, disrupt essential services, displace populations, and lead to malnutrition and infectious disease outbreaks.  Further, climate change influences air quality, increasing respiratory illnesses through heightened pollution levels and exacerbated allergic responses.  Indirect effects include mental health impacts arising from displacement, loss of livelihoods, and climate anxiety.  Mitigating climate change through emissions reduction is crucial for protecting public health, alongside implementing adaptation strategies to build community resilience to climate-related health risks.  This interconnectedness demands a holistic approach encompassing environmental protection and public health interventions for effective global response.
