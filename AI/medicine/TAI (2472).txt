Climate change poses a profound and multifaceted threat to global public health, extending far beyond the traditionally understood impacts of extreme weather events.  Recent developments underscore the increasingly urgent need for comprehensive research into this complex relationship. While heat-related morbidity and mortality remain prominent concerns, exacerbated by increasingly frequent and intense heatwaves, the consequences are broadening to encompass vector-borne diseases, respiratory illnesses, malnutrition, and mental health challenges.  Emerging research highlights the intricate interplay between climate change and existing health inequalities, disproportionately affecting vulnerable populations already burdened by socioeconomic disadvantages and limited access to healthcare.  Furthermore, the displacement and migration triggered by climate-related disasters further strain healthcare systems and exacerbate existing health vulnerabilities. This paper will explore these evolving connections, reviewing recent epidemiological studies, examining the interplay of various climate-related stressors on human health, and analyzing the potential for mitigation and adaptation strategies to safeguard public health in a changing climate.  A particular focus will be placed on the latest advancements in predictive modeling and the development of climate-resilient healthcare systems.
