Ethical considerations in organ transplantation have evolved significantly since the first successful kidney transplant in 1954.  Early practices, often lacking robust ethical frameworks, highlighted the inherent tension between the urgent need for organs and the potential for exploitation.  This presentation will explore the historical development of ethical guidelines, tracing their evolution from the era of implicit consent and opportunistic procurement to the establishment of formalized consent processes and organ donation registries.

We will analyze key ethical challenges that persist, including the equitable allocation of scarce resources, the potential for coercion in living donor situations, and the ongoing debate surrounding presumed consent.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the moral complexities surrounding organ tourism and the commodification of human organs, emphasizing the importance of upholding human dignity and preventing exploitation in global transplant practices.  Finally, the abstract will briefly examine the role of emerging technologies, such as 3D-printed organs, in potentially alleviating some of these ethical dilemmas while introducing new challenges requiring careful consideration.  The aim is to stimulate discussion about the enduring need for robust ethical frameworks to govern organ transplantation, ensuring both fairness and respect for human life.
