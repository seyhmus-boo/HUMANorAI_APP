Adolescents experience a disproportionately high prevalence of mental health disorders, with trends indicating a concerning rise in anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors globally.  These trends are likely influenced by a complex interplay of societal factors, including increased academic pressure, social media usage, and exposure to trauma.  Furthermore, biological vulnerabilities and genetic predispositions contribute to individual risk profiles.  Current treatment approaches emphasize a biopsychosocial model, integrating pharmacological interventions, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression, with psychosocial therapies. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are particularly effective in addressing maladaptive thought patterns and emotional regulation skills.  However, access to appropriate and timely care remains a significant challenge, particularly in resource-limited settings.  Future research should focus on developing culturally sensitive interventions, improving early detection strategies, and addressing systemic barriers to access, to effectively mitigate the growing burden of adolescent mental health disorders.
