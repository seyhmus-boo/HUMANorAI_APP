Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This abstract examines the complex interplay between a changing climate and human health outcomes.  Rising temperatures directly increase morbidity and mortality through heat-related illnesses, exacerbating pre-existing cardiovascular and respiratory conditions.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, while extreme weather events like floods and droughts displace populations and disrupt essential health services, increasing the risk of malnutrition and infectious disease outbreaks.  Furthermore, altered agricultural yields impact food security, potentially leading to malnutrition and undernutrition, particularly in vulnerable populations.  The mental health consequences of climate change, including anxiety and depression related to extreme weather events and displacement, are also increasingly recognized.  Practical applications of this research include developing targeted public health interventions, such as early warning systems for heatwaves and vector-borne disease outbreaks, strengthening healthcare infrastructure resilience to extreme events, and implementing climate-resilient agricultural practices to ensure food security.  Investing in climate adaptation and mitigation strategies is crucial for safeguarding global public health and promoting societal well-being in the face of a changing climate.
