This review examines current trends and treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents, a population experiencing a concerning rise in prevalence.  Anxiety disorders and depression remain highly prevalent, with increasing rates of self-harm and suicide attempts reported globally.  Contributing factors, including social media use, academic pressures, and societal changes, are discussed.  While traditional treatments such as psychotherapy (CBT, DBT) and pharmacotherapy (SSRIs, SNRIs) remain cornerstones of care, this review highlights the growing emphasis on integrated approaches.  These include family-based interventions, peer support programs, and digital mental health platforms, acknowledging the need for accessible and tailored interventions.  However, significant challenges persist, including disparities in access to care, particularly for marginalized youth and those in low-resource settings.  Further research is urgently needed to refine existing treatments, develop culturally sensitive interventions, and address the underlying societal factors contributing to this escalating public health concern.  Early identification, proactive interventions, and a strengthened focus on prevention are crucial for improving outcomes and reducing the long-term impact of adolescent mental health disorders.
