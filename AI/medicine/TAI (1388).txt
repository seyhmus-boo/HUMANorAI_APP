Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgery, prioritizing smaller incisions and reduced patient trauma.  Evolution within MIS has been driven by technological advancements and a deepening understanding of surgical anatomy and physiology.  Early laparoscopic approaches, limited by two-dimensional visualization and instrument dexterity, have been significantly enhanced.  High-definition 3D laparoscopy and robotic-assisted surgery now offer superior visualization and precision, enabling complex procedures previously impossible via MIS.  Single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) further minimize invasiveness, although widespread adoption remains limited by technical challenges.  Recent developments focus on enhanced visualization technologies, such as fluorescence imaging for improved tissue differentiation, and the integration of artificial intelligence for real-time assistance with surgical planning and execution.  Furthermore, advancements in surgical instrumentation, including flexible endoscopes and smaller, more dexterous instruments, continue to expand the scope of procedures amenable to MIS.  Despite these advances, ongoing challenges remain in areas such as training, cost-effectiveness, and the development of standardized surgical techniques for optimal patient outcomes across diverse populations.
