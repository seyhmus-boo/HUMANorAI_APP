Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, driven by advancements in instrumentation, imaging, and surgical skills.  Early MIS techniques, largely characterized by laparoscopy, focused on adapting open surgical principles to a smaller access point.  This initial phase saw limitations in dexterity and visualization, restricting its application to specific procedures.  However, the subsequent development of robotic-assisted surgery significantly improved precision, dexterity, and surgeon ergonomics, expanding the scope of MIS to complex procedures previously deemed unsuitable.  Concurrent advances in energy sources (e.g., ultrasonic and bipolar electrosurgery) and suture techniques further enhanced the efficacy and safety of these interventions.  Recent innovations include single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), minimizing surgical trauma even further.  These advancements translate to improved patient outcomes, including reduced pain, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and lower complication rates across a broad spectrum of surgical specialties, such as cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery, and gynecological procedures.  Ongoing research focuses on enhancing visualization, developing novel instruments, and exploring artificial intelligence integration for improved precision and safety in MIS.
