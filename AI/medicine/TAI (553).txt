Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical skills.  Early laparoscopic procedures, hampered by limited dexterity and visualization, have been superseded by robotic-assisted surgery, offering enhanced precision and control.  This review examines key milestones in MIS evolution, focusing on the transition from conventional open surgery to laparoscopy and subsequently, robotic platforms.  Significant improvements in camera technology, from 2D to 3D and high-definition imaging, have considerably enhanced surgical visualization.  The development of smaller, more versatile instruments, including flexible endoscopes and robotic manipulators, has facilitated access to complex anatomical sites.  Concurrent advancements in energy sources, such as laser and ultrasonic dissection, have improved precision and reduced tissue trauma.  While benefits include reduced morbidity, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery, challenges remain, including the learning curve associated with new technologies and the potential for complications. Future directions include further miniaturization, integration of augmented reality and artificial intelligence, and the exploration of novel approaches like single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).  These advancements promise to further refine MIS techniques, expanding access to minimally invasive options for a broader range of surgical procedures.
