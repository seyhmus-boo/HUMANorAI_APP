Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health.  This lecture explores the intricate relationship between a changing climate and human well-being, focusing on direct and indirect impacts.  Direct effects include increased mortality from heatwaves and the expansion of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, driven by shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns.  Indirect effects are equally crucial, encompassing disruptions to food security leading to malnutrition, exacerbated air pollution triggering respiratory illnesses, and mental health consequences stemming from displacement and trauma associated with extreme weather events.  Furthermore, the lecture examines the disproportionate burden borne by vulnerable populations, particularly those in low-income countries and marginalized communities. Mitigation and adaptation strategies, encompassing both global and local actions, are highlighted as crucial in minimizing the escalating public health crisis stemming from climate change.  A multi-sectoral approach involving healthcare, environmental policy, and social justice initiatives is vital for effective intervention and building climate-resilient health systems.
