Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are traditionally framed within bioethics, focusing on donor consent, allocation justice, and the physician-patient relationship. However, a novel perspective emerges when considering the quantum mechanical nature of biological systems.  This presentation explores the implications of quantum coherence and entanglement in biological processes, particularly within organ viability and transplantation success.  We argue that the fragility of quantum coherence during organ preservation and transplantation raises profound ethical questions.  The potential for decoherence to negatively impact post-transplant function introduces a previously unconsidered element of risk, necessitating a re-evaluation of current ethical frameworks.  Furthermore, the inherent unpredictability associated with quantum phenomena challenges the principle of informed consent, particularly regarding the potential for unforeseen long-term consequences.  This presentation will outline the conceptual framework for integrating quantum mechanics into bioethical discussions surrounding organ transplantation, advocating for a multidisciplinary approach that incorporates physicists, biologists, and ethicists to navigate this emerging territory and develop ethically sound practices in this rapidly advancing field. We propose that a deeper understanding of the quantum underpinnings of organ function may revolutionize organ preservation techniques and ultimately improve transplantation outcomes, while simultaneously prompting a reevaluation of existing ethical guidelines.
