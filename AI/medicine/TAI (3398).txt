This presentation explores the transformative impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on medical diagnostics, focusing on its practical applications and potential to revolutionize healthcare.  AI algorithms, particularly deep learning models, are demonstrating remarkable proficiency in analyzing medical images (radiology, pathology), genomic data, and electronic health records (EHRs) to aid in early and accurate diagnosis.  We will examine specific applications such as AI-powered tools for detecting cancerous lesions in mammograms and CT scans, identifying retinal diseases from fundus images, and predicting patient risk for cardiovascular events based on EHR data.  These tools offer the potential for improved diagnostic accuracy, reduced human error, accelerated diagnosis times, and increased accessibility of specialized expertise, particularly in underserved areas. However, we will also address critical challenges, including data bias, algorithm transparency ("black box" problem), regulatory hurdles, and the ethical implications of AI's role in clinical decision-making.  The presentation will conclude by considering the future trajectory of AI in diagnostics and its role in fostering a more equitable and efficient healthcare system.
