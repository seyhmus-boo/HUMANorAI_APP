The evolution of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques has been driven by a continuous pursuit of reduced trauma and improved patient outcomes.  However, this advancement presents significant experimental challenges.  Early MIS relied on rudimentary instrumentation and limited visualization, hampered by inflexible endoscopes and a lack of haptic feedback, hindering precision and dexterity.  Experimental studies struggled to accurately replicate the in vivo constraints of confined surgical spaces and the dynamic nature of organ movement.

Developing robotic surgery addressed some limitations, yet introduced new complexities.  Precisely mapping and controlling robotic manipulators within the body remains a major challenge, as does ensuring consistent and reliable force feedback for surgeons.  Experimental validation necessitates sophisticated simulation models and in vivo studies to test the safety and efficacy of novel robotic systems and their interaction with biological tissues.  Furthermore, the development of novel materials for instruments, including those incorporating advanced imaging or energy delivery, necessitates rigorous biocompatibility and durability testing before clinical translation.  Finally, experimental design must account for the variability in anatomical structures and surgical scenarios, requiring large and diverse sample sizes for robust conclusions.
