Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, extending beyond the commonly understood impacts of extreme weather events.  This research paper examines the complex and evolving relationship between climate change and public health outcomes, exploring both direct and indirect consequences.  Direct impacts include increased morbidity and mortality from heatwaves, the expansion of vector-borne diseases, and exacerbated air pollution leading to respiratory illnesses. Indirect effects encompass disruptions to food security, water scarcity, and displacement, all contributing to malnutrition, infectious disease outbreaks, and mental health challenges.

This study will analyze existing literature to synthesize the current understanding of this crucial nexus, focusing on the disparities in vulnerability across different populations and geographic regions.  Furthermore, it will investigate the practical applications of this knowledge, exploring the potential of predictive modelling to anticipate health risks associated with climate change and the implementation of effective adaptation and mitigation strategies.  These applications include improved early warning systems for heatwaves and infectious disease outbreaks, the development of climate-resilient healthcare infrastructure, and public health interventions aimed at promoting climate-conscious behaviours. Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to the growing body of evidence informing policy decisions and public health initiatives designed to protect vulnerable populations and mitigate the escalating health burdens of climate change.
