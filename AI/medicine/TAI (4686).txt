Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing the effectiveness of antimicrobial therapies and impacting healthcare systems worldwide.  The indiscriminate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, has driven the selection and dissemination of resistant pathogens.  This phenomenon is further exacerbated by the limited development of novel antibiotics, creating a critical imbalance between the emergence of resistance and the availability of effective treatments.  The consequences are far-reaching, including increased morbidity and mortality rates associated with bacterial infections, prolonged hospital stays, and heightened healthcare costs.  The global economic burden is substantial, encompassing not only direct healthcare expenditures but also indirect costs related to lost productivity and reduced economic output.  Furthermore, the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) pose a particular challenge, rendering treatment options extremely limited and necessitating the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies. Addressing this crisis requires a multifaceted approach encompassing responsible antibiotic stewardship, investment in research and development of novel antimicrobials, improved infection prevention and control measures, and strengthened global surveillance networks.  Without concerted global action, the post-antibiotic era poses a severe threat to public health and global security.
