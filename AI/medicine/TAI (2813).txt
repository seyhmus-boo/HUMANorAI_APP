Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the escalating issue of mental health disorders in adolescents.  Recent trends indicate a significant rise in anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviours, demanding a multi-faceted approach.  This necessitates strong interdisciplinary collaboration.

Psychiatry, of course, provides crucial diagnostic and pharmacological interventions.  However, the efficacy of these treatments is significantly enhanced by psychological therapies, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT), offered by trained psychologists.  Furthermore, sociological factors, such as family dynamics and peer influence, play a crucial role and necessitate the involvement of social workers who can address systemic issues and support family therapy.  Educational psychologists can identify and mitigate academic stressors contributing to mental health problems, while occupational therapists can assist in developing coping mechanisms and life skills. This collaborative approach, integrating medical, psychological, and social perspectives, offers the best chance for successful treatment and prevention strategies for adolescent mental health challenges.  Effective intervention requires a holistic understanding of the individual within their complex environment.
