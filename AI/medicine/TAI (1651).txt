Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, a relationship often overlooked despite its profound implications.  This presentation will explore this intricate connection using accessible analogies to illuminate key impacts.  We will consider climate change as a "slow-burning wildfire," gradually degrading the environmental infrastructure crucial for human health.  This degradation manifests in several ways: increased vector-borne disease incidence, analogous to "spreading embers" igniting outbreaks; exacerbated air pollution, akin to a "smog blanket" suffocating vulnerable populations; and heightened frequency of extreme weather events, comparable to "explosive bursts" causing injuries, displacement, and mental health distress.  Furthermore, the impact on food security – likened to a "failing harvest" – contributes to malnutrition and related health problems.  We will argue that addressing climate change is not merely an environmental imperative, but a fundamental public health necessity.  Effective mitigation and adaptation strategies, therefore, require interdisciplinary collaboration and a holistic understanding of the intertwined nature of environmental and human well-being.  This presentation aims to foster a clearer understanding of this crucial relationship and inspire proactive interventions to safeguard public health in a changing climate.
