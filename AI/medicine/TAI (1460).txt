The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare diagnostics holds immense promise, yet its translation from experimental settings to routine clinical practice faces significant challenges.  Current research highlights impressive accuracy in specific diagnostic tasks, such as image analysis for cancer detection and electrocardiogram interpretation. However, these successes often rely on carefully curated datasets, raising concerns about generalizability and real-world performance.  The heterogeneity of patient populations, variations in imaging protocols, and the presence of confounding factors not adequately represented in training data significantly impact AI model robustness.  Furthermore,  data privacy and ethical considerations pose substantial hurdles.  The "black box" nature of some AI algorithms hinders interpretability, crucial for clinicians to understand the rationale behind a diagnostic decision and build trust.  Addressing these experimental limitations requires larger, more diverse datasets, improved model explainability techniques, rigorous validation studies across various clinical settings, and the development of robust quality control mechanisms.  Overcoming these hurdles is essential for ensuring the safe and effective integration of AI into clinical diagnostic workflows.
