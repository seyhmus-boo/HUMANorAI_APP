Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are multifaceted and demand an interdisciplinary approach. This presentation explores the key ethical dilemmas arising from the scarcity of transplantable organs, focusing on the intricate interplay between medical practice, law, and philosophy.  We will examine the allocation of scarce resources, analyzing existing systems and their inherent biases, with a particular focus on distributive justice and the potential for inequitable access based on socioeconomic status and geography.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the ethical challenges surrounding informed consent, particularly in vulnerable populations, and the implications of  live organ donation, including potential coercion and the donor's well-being.  We will also explore the evolving role of artificial intelligence in organ allocation and its ethical implications. By highlighting the contributions of medical ethicists, legal scholars, and social scientists, this presentation argues for a collaborative, interdisciplinary framework to navigate the complex ethical landscape of organ transplantation and ensure equitable and just access to life-saving treatments.  The presentation will conclude by suggesting pathways towards a more ethically robust and socially responsible system.
