Climate change poses a significant and escalating threat to public health globally.  This presentation will explore the multifaceted relationship between a changing climate and human wellbeing, focusing on recent developments and emerging research.  We will examine the direct impacts of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and wildfires, on morbidity and mortality rates, highlighting the disproportionate burden experienced by vulnerable populations.  Furthermore, we will discuss the indirect effects, including the altered distribution of infectious diseases (e.g., vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever), changes in air quality leading to respiratory illnesses, and the impacts on mental health stemming from displacement and environmental trauma.  Recent advancements in epidemiological modelling and attribution science are enabling more precise quantification of the health consequences of climate change, facilitating targeted public health interventions.  The presentation will conclude by discussing the crucial need for integrated climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect and improve population health, emphasizing the urgent necessity for collaborative, interdisciplinary action.
