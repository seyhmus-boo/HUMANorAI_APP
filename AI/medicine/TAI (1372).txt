Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field.  This abstract explores key challenges, focusing on three primary areas. Firstly, the allocation of scarce organs necessitates a just and equitable system, transcending considerations of wealth, social status, or influence.  Debate persists regarding the optimal balance between utilitarian approaches (maximizing overall benefit) and egalitarian principles (ensuring fair access for all). Secondly, the process of informed consent, particularly in situations involving incapacitated donors, raises significant concerns.  Determining appropriate surrogates and ensuring their decisions genuinely reflect the potential donor's wishes remain contentious.  Thirdly, the potential for coercion, exploitation, and commercialization within the global organ trade presents severe ethical dilemmas.  Combating this illicit activity requires robust international cooperation and stringent regulatory frameworks to protect vulnerable populations and uphold the integrity of transplantation medicine.  Addressing these ethical challenges is crucial for maintaining public trust and ensuring the ethical viability of this life-saving procedure.
