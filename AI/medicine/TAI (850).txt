Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, particularly concerning experimental interventions.  This presentation examines the ethical challenges inherent in the advancement of transplantation techniques, focusing on three key areas. First, we explore the ethical permissibility of utilizing novel experimental techniques, such as xenotransplantation and tissue engineering,  considering the potential risks to both donors and recipients, and the need for robust pre-clinical testing and informed consent.  Second, the allocation of scarce experimental organs and the potential for inequitable access based on socioeconomic status or other factors will be discussed.  This includes analyzing the fairness of prioritizing experimental therapies for certain patient subgroups. Finally, the ethical implications of using artificial intelligence and machine learning in organ allocation and surgical planning will be addressed, highlighting the importance of transparency, accountability, and the mitigation of algorithmic bias. The presentation concludes by arguing for a rigorous ethical framework, integrating principles of justice, beneficence, and non-maleficence, to guide the responsible development and implementation of experimental organ transplantation approaches.
