Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), initially limited by technical constraints, has undergone a dramatic evolution driven by advancements in instrumentation, imaging, and surgical skills.  Early MIS techniques, primarily relying on rigid endoscopes and limited articulation, have been superseded by flexible endoscopes, robotic systems, and enhanced visualization modalities like 3D laparoscopy and fluorescence imaging.  This evolution has enabled increasingly complex procedures to be performed through smaller incisions, resulting in reduced patient trauma, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  Robotic surgery, in particular, offers enhanced dexterity, precision, and tremor filtration, facilitating intricate procedures in challenging anatomical locations.  Practical applications span various surgical specialties, including general surgery (cholecystectomy, appendectomy), urology (prostatectomy, nephrectomy), gynecology (hysterectomy, myomectomy), and cardiac surgery.  Ongoing research focuses on refining robotic platforms, developing novel energy sources, integrating augmented reality, and utilizing artificial intelligence for improved surgical planning and execution.  These advancements continue to broaden the scope and efficacy of MIS, ultimately improving patient care and transforming surgical practice.
