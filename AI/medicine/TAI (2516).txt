Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting key regulatory pathways governing cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.  Advances in genomic sequencing technologies have dramatically increased our understanding of the genetic heterogeneity underlying diverse cancer types. This has facilitated the identification of driver mutations, specific genetic alterations directly contributing to malignant transformation.  Furthermore, the characterization of tumor mutational burden (TMB) and the identification of neoantigens—novel antigens arising from mutations—have revolutionized cancer immunotherapy approaches.  Personalized medicine leverages this knowledge to tailor treatment strategies to individual patient genotypes. This includes targeted therapies, designed to specifically inhibit the products of oncogenes or bypass the effects of tumor suppressor gene inactivation.  Moreover, the analysis of a patient's unique genetic profile allows for predictive modeling of treatment response, optimizing therapeutic efficacy and minimizing adverse effects.  Ongoing research continues to refine these techniques, integrating multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) to develop even more precise and effective personalized cancer treatments, moving beyond single gene approaches towards comprehensive understanding of the tumor microenvironment and its interactions with the host.
