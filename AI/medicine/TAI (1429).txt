Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine and public health infrastructure. This presentation will explore the multifaceted nature of AR and its far-reaching consequences.  Recent developments underscore the urgency of the situation.  We will examine the alarming rise of resistance to last-resort antibiotics, exemplified by the increasing prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis.  The contribution of various factors, including overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agricultural practices, and inadequate infection control measures, will be discussed.  Furthermore, the presentation will highlight recent advancements in combating AR, focusing on novel diagnostic tools for rapid detection of resistant pathogens, the development of innovative antimicrobial therapies, including phage therapy and novel antibiotic classes, and the crucial role of stewardship programs in promoting responsible antibiotic use. Finally, we will discuss the global collaborative efforts needed to address this complex challenge, emphasizing the need for integrated, multi-sectoral approaches to mitigate the impact of AR and ensure the continued effectiveness of existing antibiotics.
