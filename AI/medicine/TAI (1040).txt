The genetic basis of cancer is increasingly understood, fueling advances in personalized medicine.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have revolutionized cancer diagnostics, allowing for the comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes and transcriptomes. This has led to the identification of numerous driver mutations and specific genomic alterations predictive of response to targeted therapies.  Recent developments focus on expanding beyond single-gene mutations to encompass the complex interplay of multiple genetic alterations, epigenetic modifications, and the tumor microenvironment.  Liquid biopsies, utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), offer minimally invasive methods for real-time monitoring of disease progression and treatment response, enabling dynamic adjustments to therapy.  Furthermore, the application of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms to analyze vast genomic datasets is improving the accuracy of cancer risk prediction, prognosis, and treatment selection.  These advances are paving the way for truly personalized approaches, tailoring therapies to the unique genetic signature of an individual's tumor, ultimately enhancing treatment efficacy and minimizing adverse effects while furthering the development of novel therapeutic strategies.  However, challenges remain in addressing the heterogeneity of cancers and translating these findings into widespread clinical practice.
