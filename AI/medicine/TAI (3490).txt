Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health globally.  Rising temperatures contribute directly to increased morbidity and mortality through heatstroke, cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses exacerbated by air pollution, and the spread of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue fever.  Changes in precipitation patterns, leading to more frequent and intense droughts and floods, disrupt food security and water sanitation, increasing the risk of malnutrition, diarrheal diseases, and displacement.  The resulting environmental degradation further impacts mental health, with observed increases in anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder following extreme weather events.  Indirect effects include disruptions to healthcare infrastructure and access to essential services, hindering effective response to health crises.  Vulnerable populations, including children, the elderly, and those with pre-existing conditions, bear a disproportionate burden of these health impacts.  Mitigation efforts focused on reducing greenhouse gas emissions are crucial for preventing future health consequences, while adaptation strategies are necessary to build resilience and improve healthcare systems' preparedness for climate-related health challenges.  Further research is needed to quantify the full extent of climate change's impact and inform effective public health interventions.
