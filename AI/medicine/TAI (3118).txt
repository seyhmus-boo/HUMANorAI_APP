Good morning.  For decades, cancer treatment relied on broad-spectrum approaches, neglecting the inherent heterogeneity of the disease.  Early understandings focused on environmental factors and broad cellular mechanisms. However, the revolution in genomics has fundamentally altered our perspective.  We now recognize cancer as a disease driven by somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting crucial regulatory pathways like cell cycle control and apoptosis.

Advances in sequencing technology, particularly next-generation sequencing (NGS), have enabled comprehensive profiling of tumour genomes, revealing unique mutational signatures for individual cancers.  This understanding forms the bedrock of personalized medicine.  Identifying specific driver mutations allows for targeted therapies, such as kinase inhibitors tailored to specific oncogenic mutations.  Furthermore, immunotherapies, harnessing the power of the patient's own immune system, are increasingly personalized by identifying tumour-specific neoantigens.  While challenges remain regarding cost-effectiveness and the identification of truly actionable mutations, the integration of genomic data into clinical practice represents a significant leap towards more effective, individualized cancer treatment strategies.
