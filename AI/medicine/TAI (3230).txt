Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, jeopardizing the effective treatment of bacterial infections. This presentation will examine the multifaceted nature of AR, exploring its underlying mechanisms, contributing factors, and far-reaching consequences.  We will discuss the role of indiscriminate antibiotic use in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, in driving the selection and spread of resistant strains. The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, particularly concerning in healthcare settings, will be highlighted, emphasizing the associated increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  Further, the presentation will analyze the global implications of AR, including its impact on sustainable development goals, food security (through livestock production), and economic stability.  Finally, we will briefly explore strategies for mitigating the crisis, encompassing responsible antibiotic stewardship, development of novel therapeutic agents, improved diagnostic tools, and strengthened global surveillance networks.  The presentation aims to stimulate discussion on the urgent need for collaborative, multi-sectoral efforts to address this critical public health challenge.
