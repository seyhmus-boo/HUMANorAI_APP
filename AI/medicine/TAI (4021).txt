The relationship between climate change and public health is complex and increasingly pressing.  Historically, environmental shifts have profoundly impacted human health, evidenced by past pandemics linked to climate variability.  However, anthropogenic climate change presents a novel scale and intensity of threats.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns increase the risk of waterborne diseases and vector-borne infections, as altered rainfall and temperature influence the geographic distribution and activity of disease vectors like mosquitoes.  Furthermore, extreme weather events—floods, droughts, wildfires—disrupt healthcare infrastructure, displace populations, and cause both direct injuries and indirect mental health consequences like PTSD.  Air pollution, worsened by climate change-induced extreme weather, significantly contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  Food security is also jeopardized, leading to malnutrition and associated health problems. Therefore, mitigating climate change is not just an environmental imperative, but a critical public health strategy.
