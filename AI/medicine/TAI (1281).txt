Cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease, underscoring the need for personalized medicine approaches.  While significant advances have been made in identifying cancer-associated genes and mutations through genomic sequencing, translating this knowledge into effective personalized therapies faces considerable experimental challenges.  Accurately identifying driver mutations amidst passenger mutations remains difficult, particularly in complex cancers with high mutational burdens.  Furthermore, the functional validation of identified mutations often requires laborious and resource-intensive in vitro and in vivo experiments,  hampered by limitations in creating faithful cellular and animal models that recapitulate the intricate tumor microenvironment.  The development of robust predictive biomarkers remains a significant hurdle, as genomic profiles alone often fail to fully account for treatment response variability.  Addressing these challenges necessitates the integration of multi-omics data, including transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, alongside sophisticated computational modeling to refine our understanding of cancer pathogenesis and predict individual treatment responses.  Overcoming these experimental limitations is crucial for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer medicine.
