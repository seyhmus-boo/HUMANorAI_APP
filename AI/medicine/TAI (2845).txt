Antibiotic resistance, the ability of microorganisms to withstand antimicrobial agents, poses a significant and escalating global threat.  Overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, have driven the selection and spread of resistant strains. This phenomenon jeopardizes the efficacy of established treatments for bacterial infections, leading to prolonged illness, increased mortality, and substantial healthcare costs.  The global implications are far-reaching, affecting all healthcare sectors and potentially undermining progress in various fields, including surgery, organ transplantation, and cancer treatment.  The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly in hospital settings, necessitates the urgent implementation of comprehensive strategies. These strategies must include stewardship programs promoting judicious antibiotic use, improved infection control measures, development of novel antimicrobials, and intensified global surveillance efforts to monitor resistance patterns and guide effective interventions.  Failure to address this challenge will result in a return to a pre-antibiotic era, with potentially catastrophic consequences for global health and economic stability.
