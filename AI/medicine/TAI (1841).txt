Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the escalating prevalence of mental health disorders among adolescents and the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in their treatment.  Trends indicate a significant rise in anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviours, often exacerbated by societal pressures and the digital age.  These disorders are rarely isolated; comorbidities such as substance abuse and eating disorders are common. Effective treatment necessitates a holistic approach, moving beyond the traditional siloed model of care.

Psychiatrists provide medication management and diagnosis, while psychologists offer therapeutic interventions like Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behaviour Therapy (DBT).  Crucially, social workers address socio-environmental factors, facilitating access to resources and support systems within the family and community.  School counselors play a vital role in early identification and intervention, providing a crucial link between the adolescent's academic life and their mental well-being.  This interdisciplinary collaboration ensures a comprehensive and individualized treatment plan, maximizing positive outcomes and promoting long-term mental health.  Without integrated approaches, adolescents face significant challenges navigating these complex disorders.
