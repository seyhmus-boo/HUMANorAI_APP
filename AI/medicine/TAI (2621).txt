Climate change poses a profound and multifaceted threat to global public health, extending far beyond the traditionally recognized impacts of extreme weather events.  Recent developments underscore the urgency of understanding this complex relationship, moving beyond correlative studies to increasingly sophisticated analyses of causal mechanisms and vulnerable populations.  This paper examines the evolving understanding of climate changeâ€™s influence on human health, focusing on several key areas. Firstly, we explore the escalating incidence of heat-related illnesses and mortality, exacerbated by more frequent and intense heatwaves.  Secondly, we analyze the impact on vector-borne diseases, with changing climatic conditions influencing the geographical distribution and transmission cycles of pathogens such as malaria and dengue fever.  Furthermore, the paper considers the indirect health consequences, including the impacts on food security, water scarcity, and mental health stemming from climate-related displacement and trauma.  Finally, we discuss recent advances in modelling and predictive capabilities, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary research in informing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect public health in a changing climate.
