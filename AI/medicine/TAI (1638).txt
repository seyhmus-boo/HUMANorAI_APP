Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This presentation will explore the evolutionary trajectory of MIS, highlighting key technological advancements and their impact on surgical approaches across various specialties.  We will examine the transition from early laparoscopic techniques to the current landscape of robotic surgery, single-incision surgery, and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).

Crucially, the progress of MIS has been profoundly shaped by interdisciplinary collaboration.  We will analyze the essential contributions of engineering, materials science, imaging technology, and computer science in developing sophisticated instruments, visualization systems, and surgical simulators.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the vital role of interprofessional teams, including surgeons, nurses, anesthesiologists, and specialized technicians, in optimizing patient care and surgical outcomes within the context of MIS.  Finally, we will briefly discuss future directions, including the potential of artificial intelligence and augmented reality to further enhance the precision, safety, and efficiency of minimally invasive procedures.
