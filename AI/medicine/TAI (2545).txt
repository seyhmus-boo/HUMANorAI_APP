Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma, has revolutionized surgical practice.  However, the evolution of MIS techniques has not been without significant experimental challenges. This paper explores the historical trajectory of these challenges, focusing on the hurdles encountered in translating innovative concepts into clinically viable procedures.  Early limitations stemmed from the inherent difficulties in manipulating instruments within confined spaces, leading to compromised dexterity and precision compared to open surgery.  The development of specialized instruments, including laparoscopes and robotic arms, addressed some issues, yet introduced new experimental complexities.  These include  the need for advanced imaging techniques, the development of haptic feedback systems to improve surgeon control, and the rigorous testing of biocompatible materials for implants and instruments.  Furthermore, the translation from bench to bedside necessitates overcoming challenges related to training surgeons in new techniques, ensuring patient safety in novel procedural settings, and establishing robust and reproducible assessment methodologies for comparing MIS outcomes with traditional approaches. This review will critically analyze these experimental barriers, highlighting key milestones and remaining limitations in the ongoing refinement of MIS techniques.
