Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting normal growth regulation.  Advances in genomics have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic underpinnings of this disease, revealing diverse mutational landscapes across cancer types. This has fueled the development of personalized medicine, moving beyond a "one-size-fits-all" approach.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) allows comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, identifying driver mutations that contribute to carcinogenesis and informing targeted therapies.  For instance, identification of EGFR mutations in lung cancer facilitates the use of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, while specific BRCA mutations predict response to PARP inhibitors.  Furthermore, analysis of tumor microenvironment and immune signatures using techniques like immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing improves treatment stratification and informs immunotherapy selection.  Despite progress, challenges remain, including the complexity of inter-tumoral heterogeneity and the need for more robust predictive biomarkers to maximize treatment efficacy and minimize adverse effects. Ongoing research focuses on integrating multi-omics data to refine personalized cancer treatment strategies.
