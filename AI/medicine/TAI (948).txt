Cancer is a complex disease driven by the accumulation of somatic mutations affecting key cellular processes.  Advances in genomic technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, enabling the identification of driver mutations, fusion genes, and copy number alterations specific to individual tumors. This wealth of genomic data has fueled the development of personalized medicine approaches, focusing on targeted therapies tailored to the unique genetic profile of a patient's cancer.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms facilitate comprehensive genomic profiling, identifying actionable mutations that inform treatment decisions, leading to improved response rates and reduced toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy.  However, challenges remain, including the identification of truly "driver" mutations amongst numerous passenger mutations, the complexity of tumor heterogeneity and evolution, and the cost and accessibility of comprehensive genomic testing.  Ongoing research focuses on developing more sophisticated computational tools for analyzing complex genomic data, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and improving the predictive power of genomic biomarkers to ensure that the promise of personalized cancer medicine is realized for all patients.
