Climate change poses a significant and evolving threat to public health, demanding urgent interdisciplinary attention.  This presentation explores the complex and multifaceted relationship between these two critical global challenges, examining both established and emerging impacts. Historically, climate variability has influenced disease patterns, with periods of drought and flooding linked to outbreaks of infectious diseases like cholera and malaria.  However, anthropogenic climate change is intensifying these risks through multiple pathways.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and respiratory problems, while altered precipitation patterns increase the risk of waterborne diseases and vector-borne infections.  Furthermore, climate change contributes to food insecurity, malnutrition, and mental health issues related to displacement and trauma resulting from extreme weather events.  This presentation will review established epidemiological evidence, discuss emerging health threats, and highlight the urgent need for integrated climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect and improve global public health.  It will also briefly address the disparities in vulnerability and the need for equitable solutions to address the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities.
