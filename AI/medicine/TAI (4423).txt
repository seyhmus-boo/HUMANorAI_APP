The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Early research, focusing on identifying oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, laid the groundwork for understanding the molecular mechanisms driving carcinogenesis.  Landmark discoveries, such as the identification of the *BRCA1/2* genes and their association with increased breast and ovarian cancer risk, highlighted the power of genetic testing in predicting susceptibility.

Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, identifying a multitude of somatic mutations and copy number alterations specific to individual cancers. This has led to the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) for specific mutations in lung cancer, offering improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapy.  However, challenges remain, including the heterogeneity of cancers, the emergence of drug resistance, and the cost and accessibility of comprehensive genomic testing.  Despite these limitations, the integration of genomic data into clinical practice represents a significant advancement in cancer treatment, ultimately aiming for the delivery of truly personalized and effective cancer care.  Future research should focus on further refining our understanding of tumor heterogeneity and developing predictive biomarkers to maximize the benefits of personalized medicine in oncology.
