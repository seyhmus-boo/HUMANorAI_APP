Recent literature highlights a concerning upward trend in mental health disorders among adolescents, demanding a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach to understanding and treating these conditions.  The rise in anxiety, depression, and self-harm necessitates moving beyond siloed approaches.  Effective interventions require collaboration between psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers, educators, and family therapists.  While pharmacological treatments remain crucial for severe cases,  the review emphasizes the increasing importance of evidence-based psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), often delivered in integrated care models.  Furthermore, addressing societal factors, including social media's impact and school-based stressors, is critical.  Collaboration with educators allows for early identification and tailored support within the school environment.  Family therapy plays a vital role in understanding the family dynamic's influence and promoting healthy coping mechanisms.  The successful management of adolescent mental health disorders, therefore, relies heavily on a robust interdisciplinary network, promoting holistic care and addressing both individual needs and systemic influences.  Further research is needed to optimise interprofessional collaboration and evaluate the long-term effectiveness of these integrated models.
