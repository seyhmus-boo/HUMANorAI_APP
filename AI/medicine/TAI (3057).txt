Organ transplantation, a life-saving medical marvel, presents profound ethical dilemmas. Historically, early transplants relied on procured organs from cadavers, raising concerns about consent and the definition of death.  The advent of living donation introduced further complexities, notably the potential for coercion and exploitation of vulnerable donors.  Determining equitable allocation remains a central challenge;  prioritising recipients based on medical urgency versus factors like social status or wealth raises questions of justice and fairness.  The commodification of organs, explicitly prohibited in many jurisdictions, remains a persistent concern, particularly given the global disparity in organ availability.  Furthermore, informed consent, encompassing the risks and uncertainties of the procedure and the potential for long-term complications, is paramount.  Finally, the ethical framework surrounding end-of-life decisions, especially those impacting organ availability, necessitates ongoing debate and refinement to ensure both respect for individual autonomy and the equitable distribution of scarce resources.
