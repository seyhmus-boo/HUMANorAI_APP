Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding and effective mitigation.  This abstract highlights the complex interplay between climate change impacts and human health outcomes, emphasizing crucial interdisciplinary links.  Rising temperatures contribute directly to heat-related morbidity and mortality, while altered precipitation patterns influence the distribution and incidence of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever.  Changes in air quality, exacerbated by climate change, exacerbate respiratory illnesses.  Furthermore, extreme weather events, including floods and droughts, disrupt healthcare infrastructure and displace populations, increasing vulnerability to infectious diseases and mental health issues.  Effective responses require collaboration between climatologists, epidemiologists, public health officials, economists, and social scientists.  Economic analyses are crucial for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation strategies.  Social science research is essential for understanding community vulnerability and shaping effective public health interventions.  A truly interdisciplinary approach, integrating diverse data sets and perspectives, is paramount for developing effective strategies to minimize the adverse health consequences of climate change.
