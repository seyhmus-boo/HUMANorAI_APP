Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have undergone a dramatic evolution since their inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical skill. Early MIS procedures, largely reliant on laparoscopy, were limited by the restricted two-dimensional view and the dexterity challenges posed by working through small incisions.  This led to longer operative times and a steeper learning curve.  Subsequent innovations, such as the introduction of robotic surgery, addressed these limitations by providing a magnified, three-dimensional visualization and enhanced articulation and precision.  Simultaneously, advancements in energy sources, including ultrasonic dissection and bipolar coagulation, improved tissue handling and hemostasis, reducing bleeding and operative trauma.  Further refinements have encompassed the development of smaller, more versatile instruments and the integration of advanced imaging modalities, such as fluorescence imaging and augmented reality, enhancing visualization and targeting during complex procedures. This continuous evolution has expanded the scope of MIS, transitioning from simple procedures to complex visceral, thoracic, and even neurological surgeries, consistently improving patient outcomes through reduced postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, and faster recovery times.  Future directions include the exploration of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and the application of artificial intelligence to enhance surgical precision and decision-making.
