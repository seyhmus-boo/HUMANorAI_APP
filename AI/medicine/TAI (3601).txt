Minimally invasive surgical techniques have undergone a dramatic evolution since their inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and robotics.  Early laparoscopic procedures, reliant on rigid endoscopes and limited dexterity, yielded comparatively restricted surgical fields.  However, the development of flexible endoscopes, smaller instruments, and improved visualization technologies, such as high-definition cameras and 3D imaging, significantly expanded the scope and precision of minimally invasive surgery (MIS).  Recent decades have witnessed the rise of robotic-assisted surgery, offering surgeons enhanced dexterity, precision, and ergonomic improvements through magnified, three-dimensional visualization and intuitive control interfaces.  Further advancements include the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) for real-time image analysis, aiding in surgical planning and intraoperative decision-making.  Single-port access techniques, aimed at minimizing scarring and trauma, have also gained traction, though they present challenges in instrument triangulation and dexterity.  Ongoing research focuses on the development of novel materials for improved instrument design, including smaller and more flexible tools, alongside explorations in virtual reality and augmented reality for enhanced training and surgical simulation, promising further refinement and wider application of MIS across a broad range of surgical specialties.
