Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced trauma, has undergone significant evolution since its nascent stages.  Early attempts, such as the initial laparoscopes in the late 19th century, were largely diagnostic, limited by rudimentary instrumentation and poor visualization.  The 20th century witnessed gradual advancements, with the development of improved optics, smaller instruments, and the introduction of specialized insufflation techniques, enabling the progression from purely diagnostic procedures to therapeutic interventions.

The advent of fibre optics revolutionized MIS, dramatically improving image quality and enabling complex manipulations.  Concurrent technological advancements included the introduction of improved suture materials, energy sources like lasers and ultrasound, and refined robotic assistance.  This led to a wider range of procedures becoming feasible via MIS, spanning various surgical specialties.  Robotic-assisted surgery, introduced in the late 20th century, has further refined precision and dexterity, facilitating even more complex procedures with enhanced patient outcomes.  Currently, research focuses on improving visualization through augmented reality and AI-assisted navigation,  aiming to further minimize invasiveness and optimize surgical precision, paving the way for the next generation of minimally invasive surgical techniques.
