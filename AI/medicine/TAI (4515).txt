The relationship between climate change and public health is increasingly recognised as a critical global challenge.  Historically, the impact of environmental shifts on disease prevalence has been observed for centuries, with variations in temperature and rainfall influencing the spread of infectious diseases like malaria and cholera.  However, the scale and pace of anthropogenic climate change present unprecedented threats.

Rising temperatures exacerbate heat stress, leading to increased morbidity and mortality, particularly amongst vulnerable populations. Changes in precipitation patterns alter vector-borne disease distribution, expanding the geographical range of diseases like dengue fever and Lyme disease.  Extreme weather events, amplified by climate change, cause displacement, injury, and compromise sanitation infrastructure, increasing the risk of waterborne illnesses and outbreaks.  Furthermore, climate change impacts food security and nutrition, exacerbating malnutrition and associated health problems.  Therefore, addressing climate change is not merely an environmental imperative, but a fundamental public health necessity demanding proactive mitigation and adaptation strategies.
