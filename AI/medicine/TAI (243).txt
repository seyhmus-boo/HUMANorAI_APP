Climate change, driven primarily by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, presents a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health. While the Earth's climate has naturally fluctuated throughout history, the unprecedented rate of change observed in recent decades surpasses natural variability, triggering profound and complex impacts on human well-being.  Early recognition of the climate-health nexus emerged in the late 19th century with observations linking meteorological events to disease outbreaks, although the scale and scope of the issue remained largely unacknowledged until the latter half of the 20th century.  The scientific consensus solidified with the publication of several landmark reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), highlighting the projected intensification of extreme weather events, alterations in infectious disease vectors, and worsening air quality.  This research paper investigates the multifaceted relationship between climate change and public health, exploring not only the established direct impacts like heat-related mortality and the spread of vector-borne diseases, but also the indirect consequences including food insecurity, mental health challenges, and the exacerbation of existing health inequalities.  We will analyze existing literature and examine emerging research to assess the current understanding of this crucial relationship and identify critical areas for future research and public health interventions.
