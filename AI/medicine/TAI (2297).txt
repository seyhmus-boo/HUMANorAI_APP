Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the burgeoning field of personalized oncology, driven by advancements in understanding the genetic basis of cancer.  Historically, cancer treatment was largely generalized.  However, genomic sequencing now reveals the unique mutational landscape of individual tumors, identifying driver mutations responsible for uncontrolled proliferation.

This has led to targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, successfully targeting specific oncogenes like *EGFR* in lung cancer.  Recent progress includes the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, enabling rapid and comprehensive profiling of multiple genes simultaneously, informing treatment choices with greater precision.  Furthermore, liquid biopsies, analyzing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), offer minimally invasive monitoring of disease progression and treatment response.

Immunotherapy, harnessing the power of the patient's immune system, is another area of significant progress, with checkpoint inhibitors tailored to specific tumor mutational burdens.  While challenges remain, including drug resistance and cost-effectiveness, the integration of genomic data into clinical decision-making represents a paradigm shift, paving the way for truly personalized cancer care.
