Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, jeopardizing the effectiveness of life-saving treatments for bacterial infections.  This presentation will explore the multifaceted nature of AR, examining its underlying mechanisms, driving forces, and far-reaching consequences.  We will discuss the role of selective pressure from antibiotic overuse and misuse in both human and animal health sectors, including agriculture and aquaculture.  The contribution of environmental contamination and the spread of resistant genes through horizontal gene transfer will also be highlighted.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the global implications of AR, including increased morbidity and mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, escalating healthcare costs, and the potential for untreatable infections.  Finally, we will briefly examine current strategies aimed at combating AR, such as improved stewardship programs, the development of novel antibiotics, and the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches including phage therapy and immunotherapy.  The presentation concludes by emphasizing the urgent need for a coordinated global effort to mitigate the devastating impact of this growing crisis.
