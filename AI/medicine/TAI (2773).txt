Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant global public health concern, exhibiting rising prevalence rates across various diagnoses.  This abstract examines recent trends in adolescent mental health, highlighting the increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors, particularly amongst marginalized groups.  Effective treatment necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, integrating contributions from psychiatry, psychology, social work, and neuroscience.  Biological factors, including genetic predispositions and neurodevelopmental pathways, are increasingly understood, informing pharmacological interventions and personalized medicine strategies.  However, psychosocial factors such as adverse childhood experiences, family dynamics, and social determinants of health significantly impact both vulnerability and resilience.  Consequently, effective treatments incorporate evidence-based psychotherapies, such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), alongside family-based interventions and community support programs.  Collaboration between disciplines is crucial for early identification, holistic assessment, and tailored intervention strategies that address the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to adolescent mental health disorders.  Future research should focus on strengthening interdisciplinary collaborations to optimize preventative measures and improve long-term outcomes.
