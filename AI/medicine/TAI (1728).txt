Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.  This abstract highlights the intricate relationships between climate change and various health outcomes, underscoring the need for collaboration across disciplines.  Rising temperatures are directly linked to increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations. Changes in precipitation patterns exacerbate waterborne diseases and vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever.  Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, cause physical injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences.  Furthermore, altered agricultural yields impact food security and nutritional status, contributing to malnutrition and related health problems.  Addressing this complex interplay requires integrating expertise from climatology, epidemiology, public health, sociology, economics, and political science.  Effective interventions involve robust climate modeling to predict health risks, development of early warning systems, targeted public health campaigns, and policy changes promoting climate mitigation and adaptation.  Interdisciplinary research and collaboration are crucial for developing comprehensive strategies to protect and improve public health in the face of a changing climate.
