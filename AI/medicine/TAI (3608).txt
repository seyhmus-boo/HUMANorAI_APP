Mental health disorders in adolescents are a growing global concern, exhibiting complex interplay between biological, psychological, and social factors.  This abstract summarizes recent trends and treatment approaches for common adolescent mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  Prevalence rates for these disorders have steadily increased in recent decades, particularly among females, with contributing factors including increased academic pressure, social media use, and societal changes.  Early identification and intervention are crucial, yet access to appropriate care remains a significant challenge, particularly in low-resource settings.  Treatment modalities are evolving, incorporating evidence-based approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacology.  However, personalized treatment plans considering individual needs and comorbidities are essential for optimal outcomes.  Further research is needed to elucidate the complex etiology of these disorders, develop more effective prevention strategies, and address disparities in access to quality mental healthcare for adolescents worldwide.  A focus on integrating technological advances, such as telehealth, into service delivery models could improve accessibility and treatment adherence.
