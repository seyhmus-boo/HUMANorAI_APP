Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, a relationship best understood through analogy.  Consider climate change as a wildfire:  its immediate effects, such as heatstroke and wildfires themselves, are analogous to direct impacts on human health.  These are readily apparent “flames” causing immediate injury and death.  However, the “smoke” represents the less immediate but equally dangerous indirect consequences.  This includes increased vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever (expanding geographical ranges akin to spreading smoke), respiratory illnesses exacerbated by air pollution (the smoke’s irritating effects), and mental health impacts related to displacement and trauma (the lingering damage from the fire).  Furthermore,  the “scorched earth” following the wildfire symbolizes the long-term consequences: food insecurity from crop failures, malnutrition, and increased societal instability which further undermine health systems.  Addressing climate change is thus not merely an environmental imperative, but a critical public health strategy.  This presentation will explore these analogies in more detail, highlighting the complex interconnectedness between environmental changes and human health outcomes, advocating for proactive, integrated responses across sectors.
