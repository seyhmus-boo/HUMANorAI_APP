Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering reduced trauma and improved patient outcomes.  However, the evolution of MIS techniques presents significant experimental challenges.  Early advancements, primarily focused on laparoscopy, faced limitations in dexterity and visualization, hindering the translation of open surgical techniques.  The introduction of robotic surgery addressed some of these limitations, offering improved precision and dexterity, but introduced new complexities in system design, control algorithms, and haptic feedback.  Experimental validation of new MIS instruments and techniques requires rigorous benchtop testing, often using complex biomimetic models, to simulate tissue properties and surgical scenarios.  Furthermore,  translating successful benchtop results to in vivo studies poses further hurdles, requiring robust animal models that accurately reflect human anatomy and physiology,  and ethical considerations surrounding animal welfare.  Quantitative assessment of surgical performance in both settings presents challenges, requiring the development and validation of objective metrics beyond simple procedural time and complication rates.  Future progress in MIS necessitates overcoming these experimental hurdles through interdisciplinary collaborations focusing on materials science, robotics, bioengineering, and surgical education.
