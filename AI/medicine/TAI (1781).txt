Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting normal growth regulation.  Understanding the precise genetic landscape of an individual's tumor is crucial for effective treatment.  Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have revolutionized cancer genomics, enabling comprehensive profiling of both germline and somatic mutations, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions/deletions (InDels), copy number variations (CNVs), and fusion genes.  This detailed genetic characterization informs personalized medicine strategies.

Recent developments include the integration of multi-omics data, combining genomic information with transcriptomic, proteomic, and epigenetic profiles for a holistic understanding of tumor biology.  This allows for the identification of specific driver mutations and biomarkers predicting response to targeted therapies.  Furthermore, liquid biopsies, utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs), offer minimally invasive methods for continuous tumor monitoring and treatment response assessment.  These advancements, while still evolving, are paving the way for more precise, effective, and less toxic cancer therapies tailored to the individual patient's genetic profile.
