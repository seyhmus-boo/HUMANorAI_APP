Adolescence, a period of significant physical and psychological development, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and manifestation of mental health disorders.  This paper examines recent trends in the prevalence and presentation of common adolescent mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use disorders.  We analyze data from national and international epidemiological studies to identify emerging patterns and disparities across demographic groups.  Furthermore, we review the efficacy and limitations of current treatment modalities, encompassing both pharmacological and psychotherapeutic interventions.  Specific attention is given to evidence-based approaches such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and medication management, considering their appropriateness and accessibility for diverse adolescent populations.  This review highlights the urgent need for improved early detection strategies, accessible and culturally sensitive treatment services, and continued research into innovative interventions to address the growing burden of adolescent mental health disorders.  Finally, we discuss the potential role of preventative measures and systemic changes to promote positive mental wellbeing during this crucial developmental stage.
