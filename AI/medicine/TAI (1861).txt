This presentation explores the nascent field of applying quantum mechanical principles to understand the influence of nutrition on chronic disease prevention. While classical biochemistry provides a framework for understanding nutrient metabolism, a quantum perspective offers a potentially richer understanding of subtle interactions that influence cellular processes and disease susceptibility.  We will examine how quantum entanglement and tunneling may play a role in enzyme catalysis and electron transfer involved in crucial metabolic pathways associated with chronic diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease.  Specifically, we will discuss the impact of dietary antioxidants on mitigating oxidative stress through quantum-level electron transfer processes, and the potential role of quantum coherence in protein folding and function related to disease pathogenesis.  Furthermore, we will investigate how the structure and vibrational frequencies of bioactive molecules, as determined by quantum mechanical calculations, correlate with their efficacy in preventing or treating chronic diseases.  The presentation will highlight the limitations of current understanding and propose avenues for future research integrating quantum chemistry and nutritional science to advance personalized preventative medicine.  Ultimately, a holistic view incorporating both classical and quantum principles is crucial to fully unraveling the intricate relationship between nutrition and chronic disease.
