Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, extending far beyond the traditionally recognized impacts.  This research explores the complex and interwoven relationship between climate change and public health, highlighting the crucial need for interdisciplinary approaches to address this escalating crisis.  The effects are not solely environmental; they are deeply intertwined with social, economic, and political systems, necessitating collaboration across diverse fields.  This paper investigates these interdisciplinary links, examining the synergistic interactions between climate-related phenomena (e.g., extreme weather events, changing infectious disease vectors, air pollution) and their consequences for human health outcomes. We will analyze how epidemiological studies, coupled with climate modelling, economic assessments of healthcare burden, and sociological understandings of vulnerability and resilience, can inform effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.  By integrating perspectives from climate science, public health, economics, sociology, and political science, this research aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of this challenge and identify avenues for effective, collaborative intervention.
