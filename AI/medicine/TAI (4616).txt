The escalating global threat of antibiotic resistance (AR) demands an urgent and multifaceted response transcending traditional disciplinary boundaries.  This research paper explores the complex interplay of factors contributing to the rise of AR and its far-reaching consequences, emphasizing the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in mitigating this crisis.  While the clinical implications of AR – increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs – are widely acknowledged, a comprehensive understanding requires integrating perspectives from diverse fields.  This study examines the contribution of environmental science, highlighting the role of antibiotic residues in agricultural runoff and wastewater impacting microbial ecosystems.  Furthermore, it investigates the socioeconomic dimensions of AR, focusing on factors like access to healthcare, sanitation infrastructure, and the influence of global trade networks on the dissemination of resistant pathogens.  By bridging the gap between medical, ecological, social, and economic analyses, this research aims to provide a nuanced perspective on the global implications of AR and to identify potential avenues for effective intervention strategies requiring integrated, interdisciplinary approaches.
