Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, demanding urgent attention from researchers, policymakers, and healthcare professionals. This presentation will examine the multifaceted nature of AR, exploring its underlying mechanisms, drivers, and far-reaching consequences.  The increasing prevalence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, driven by factors including overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal health, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, is detailed.  We will discuss the global implications of AR, highlighting its contribution to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  The economic burden extends beyond direct healthcare expenses, encompassing lost productivity and societal disruptions resulting from prolonged infections and treatment failures.  Moreover, the presentation will analyze the complex interplay between AR and global health security, emphasizing the need for coordinated international efforts to combat this challenge.  Finally, we will briefly explore promising strategies for mitigating AR, including novel antibiotic development, stewardship programs, and the exploration of alternative therapeutic approaches. This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the global AR crisis and stimulate discussion on collaborative strategies for its effective management.
