This presentation explores the experimental challenges in rigorously establishing the causal relationship between climate change and public health outcomes. While observational studies consistently link climate-related events (e.g., heatwaves, extreme weather) to increased morbidity and mortality, establishing definitive causality remains complex.  We discuss the inherent limitations of observational data, including confounding variables (socioeconomic status, access to healthcare) and the difficulty in disentangling the effects of multiple interacting environmental stressors.  Furthermore, the long latency period between climate change impacts and health consequences presents significant challenges for experimental design.  Traditional randomized controlled trials are often impractical and ethically problematic in this context.  We will examine alternative methodologies, such as natural experiments leveraging naturally occurring climate variability or quasi-experimental designs employing interrupted time series analyses.  We conclude by emphasizing the need for innovative approaches, including advanced statistical techniques and modelling strategies, to strengthen causal inferences and inform effective public health interventions in a changing climate.  Specific examples will be drawn from research on heat-related mortality and the spread of vector-borne diseases.
