Cancer's genetic basis has been a central focus of research since the discovery of oncogenes in the 1970s.  Early studies identified key driver mutations, paving the way for understanding cancer's heterogeneity and the development of targeted therapies. However, the complexity of cancer genetics, involving multiple somatic mutations, epigenetic modifications, and interactions with the microenvironment, initially hindered the translation of this knowledge into effective personalized medicine. Recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) have dramatically accelerated progress, enabling comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors. This has led to the identification of numerous actionable mutations, driving the development of targeted therapies tailored to specific genetic alterations, such as EGFR inhibitors for lung cancer and BRAF inhibitors for melanoma.  Furthermore, the integration of genomic data with clinical information and advanced computational analysis, including machine learning, facilitates more accurate risk stratification, prognosis prediction, and the selection of optimal treatment strategies. Despite challenges related to cost, access, and the emergence of resistance mechanisms, personalized medicine based on cancer genomics holds immense promise for improving cancer treatment efficacy and patient outcomes, warranting continued investment in research and technological development.
