Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting crucial regulatory pathways and promoting uncontrolled proliferation.  Recent advances in genomics have significantly enhanced our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, moving personalized medicine beyond simple tumor staging.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies now enable comprehensive profiling of tumor genomes, identifying driver mutations, fusion genes, and copy number variations specific to individual patients. This information is crucial for targeted therapies, selecting patients most likely to benefit from specific inhibitors targeting oncogenic proteins, or immunotherapy approaches leveraging neoantigen identification.  Challenges remain, including the heterogeneity within tumors, the presence of non-coding mutations, and the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors.  Furthermore, the cost and analytical complexity of NGS data require robust bioinformatic pipelines and careful interpretation. Ongoing research focuses on refining genomic analyses to improve predictive biomarkers, identifying novel therapeutic targets, and developing more effective strategies for overcoming resistance mechanisms, ultimately aiming to improve cancer patient outcomes through truly personalized treatment strategies.
