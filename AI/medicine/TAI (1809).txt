Antibiotic resistance, the ability of bacteria to withstand antibiotic treatment, poses a significant global health threat.  Its emergence is driven by evolutionary pressures, including widespread antibiotic use in human and veterinary medicine, as well as agriculture.  This necessitates a deeper understanding of resistance mechanisms and their evolution, posing considerable experimental challenges.  Accurately modelling the complex interplay between bacterial populations, host immunity, and antibiotic exposure in vivo presents a significant hurdle.  Furthermore, studying resistance development in diverse bacterial species and across various environments requires sophisticated high-throughput screening methodologies.  Investigating the role of horizontal gene transfer, a primary driver of resistance spread, requires intricate tracing of resistance genes across bacterial communities.  Finally, developing effective countermeasures necessitates disentangling the complex evolutionary dynamics, often involving multiple resistance genes and compensatory mutations, which requires sophisticated experimental designs and computational analysis. These experimental challenges underscore the urgency for concerted global efforts in combating this growing crisis.
