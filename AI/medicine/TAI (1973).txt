Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has undergone a dramatic evolution from its nascent stages to its current prominent role in modern healthcare delivery.  Early examples, dating back to the 1960s with NASA's use of satellite communication for remote medical consultations, showcased the potential but were constrained by technological limitations and high costs.  The subsequent decades witnessed gradual advancements, primarily driven by improvements in bandwidth and the proliferation of personal computers, leading to the development of tele-consultations, remote monitoring devices, and digital imaging transmission. However, widespread adoption remained limited by infrastructural challenges, regulatory hurdles, and concerns regarding data security and patient privacy.

The advent of the 21st century, characterized by the exponential growth of the internet and mobile technologies, significantly accelerated the growth of telemedicine.  The COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, acted as a catalyst, forcing a rapid expansion of telehealth services to mitigate the risks of in-person consultations. This research paper explores the multifaceted impact of telemedicine on contemporary healthcare systems, examining its effectiveness across various specialties, its contribution to improving access to care, its influence on healthcare costs, and the challenges related to its implementation and ethical considerations surrounding its application.
