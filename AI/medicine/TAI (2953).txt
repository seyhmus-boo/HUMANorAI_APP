The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Early research, focusing on chromosomal abnormalities like the Philadelphia chromosome in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), provided crucial initial insights into the role of genetic alterations in malignancy. This understanding evolved with the identification of oncogenes, genes whose activation contributes to uncontrolled cell growth, and tumor suppressor genes, whose inactivation removes critical brakes on cellular proliferation.  The completion of the Human Genome Project further accelerated progress, allowing for large-scale genomic sequencing of cancer cells.  This has revealed the remarkably complex heterogeneity of cancer, demonstrating that individual tumors are driven by unique constellations of somatic mutations affecting numerous genes.  This discovery underpins the rationale for personalized medicine, where treatment is tailored to the specific genetic profile of a patient's tumor. Advances in next-generation sequencing now enable rapid and cost-effective profiling of these mutations, informing therapeutic decisions by guiding the selection of targeted therapies, immunotherapy approaches exploiting neoantigens, or the prediction of treatment response and potential adverse effects.  This shift from one-size-fits-all approaches towards precision oncology represents a significant step forward in cancer treatment, improving efficacy and minimizing toxicity.
