Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, driven by continuous evolution in surgical techniques.  Early MIS relied primarily on laparoscopy, employing rigid instruments and limited dexterity.  Technological advancements, including the development of flexible endoscopes, robotic surgical systems, and advanced imaging modalities, have significantly expanded the capabilities of MIS.  Robotic-assisted surgery, for instance, offers enhanced precision, dexterity, and ergonomic benefits for surgeons, leading to improved outcomes in complex procedures.  Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) represents a further evolution, aiming for scarless surgery via natural orifices, though widespread adoption is limited by technical challenges.  The integration of augmented reality and artificial intelligence holds promise for further enhancing precision, training, and surgical planning.  Practical applications span a wide range of surgical specialties, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, urological, and gynecological procedures, leading to reduced patient trauma, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and improved aesthetic outcomes.  Further research into novel instruments, imaging techniques, and training methodologies is essential to fully realize the potential of MIS and further refine its capabilities.
