Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have undergone a dramatic evolution since their inception, driven by advancements in technology and a growing emphasis on patient-centered care.  This presentation will trace the key milestones in MIS development, from early laparoscopic approaches to the current landscape of robotic surgery and image-guided interventions.  We will explore the shift from traditional open surgeryâ€™s larger incisions and associated morbidity to the smaller incisions and enhanced recovery profiles offered by MIS.

Recent developments highlighted will include the increasing sophistication of robotic systems, enabling greater dexterity, precision, and 3D visualization.  Advances in advanced energy devices, such as ultrasonic shears and LigaSure, will also be discussed, emphasizing their roles in minimizing bleeding and improving tissue dissection. The growing integration of augmented reality and artificial intelligence in surgical planning and execution represents a significant frontier, potentially improving surgical outcomes and training.  Finally, we will address the ongoing challenges and future directions of MIS, including the need for enhanced training programs and the development of personalized surgical strategies tailored to individual patient needs and anatomical variations.
