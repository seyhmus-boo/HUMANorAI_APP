Cancer arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell, disrupting normal growth regulation.  Advances in genomics have significantly advanced our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer heterogeneity, revealing distinct driver mutations and pathways across various tumor types.  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies facilitate comprehensive genomic profiling, identifying specific mutations, copy number variations, and fusion genes contributing to tumorigenesis.  This detailed molecular characterization underpins personalized medicine approaches.  Targeted therapies, designed to specifically inhibit products of oncogenes or repair defects in tumor suppressor genes, are now developed based on individual patient genomic profiles.  Furthermore, immunotherapy strategies, such as checkpoint inhibitors, are increasingly refined by integrating genomic data to predict patient responsiveness.  Ongoing challenges include identifying actionable mutations, understanding the complex interplay of multiple genetic alterations, and overcoming acquired resistance mechanisms.  Future directions focus on integrating multi-omics data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) to develop more precise and effective personalized cancer therapies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and survival.
