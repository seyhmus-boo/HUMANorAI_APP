Antibiotic resistance, a growing global crisis, represents a significant threat to public health.  Its historical trajectory, tracing back to the discovery of penicillin in the 1920s, reveals a pattern of escalating resistance following widespread antibiotic use.  Initially hailed as miracle drugs, antibiotics rapidly became integral to medicine, agriculture, and livestock management, inadvertently fostering selective pressures that favoured resistant strains.

This selective pressure, coupled with inadequate infection control practices and the overuse of broad-spectrum antibiotics, has accelerated the emergence and spread of resistant pathogens.  The global implications are profound, impacting healthcare systems, economies, and food security.  Treatment of resistant infections necessitates more expensive and often less effective therapies, increasing healthcare costs and morbidity.  The resurgence of previously manageable infections, like tuberculosis and gonorrhoea, poses a significant challenge, while the lack of new antibiotic development further exacerbates the problem.  Ultimately, the unchecked rise of antibiotic resistance threatens to render many common infections untreatable, necessitating a global, coordinated response encompassing responsible antibiotic stewardship, improved infection control, and accelerated research into novel therapeutic strategies.
