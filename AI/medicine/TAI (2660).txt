Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  The rise of resistant pathogens, driven by factors including antibiotic overuse in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and inadequate sanitation, necessitates a multifaceted response.  This abstract highlights the crucial interdisciplinary links required to combat AR.  Microbiological research focuses on understanding resistance mechanisms and identifying novel targets for drug development, while epidemiological studies track the spread of resistant strains across geographical regions and populations.  One Health initiatives emphasize the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, promoting collaborative surveillance and intervention strategies.  Social scientists investigate the complex interplay of behavioral factors, economic incentives, and policy frameworks influencing antibiotic use and resistance dissemination.  Furthermore, data science and bioinformatics are vital for analyzing large genomic datasets to monitor resistance evolution and predict future trends. Effective global strategies to control AR require collaboration between microbiologists, epidemiologists, clinicians, veterinarians, social scientists, policymakers, and data scientists, integrating knowledge and resources to address this urgent public health challenge.  Failure to implement such integrated approaches risks a return to a pre-antibiotic era with devastating consequences.
