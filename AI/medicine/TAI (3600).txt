Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, transitioning from initial rudimentary approaches to sophisticated, highly specialized procedures.  This evolution has been driven by advancements in imaging technology, instrumentation, and a deeper understanding of surgical anatomy.  Early MIS procedures, largely reliant on rigid endoscopes and limited instrumentation, primarily addressed easily accessible anatomical regions.  However, the development of flexible endoscopes, robotic surgical systems, and advanced energy sources (e.g., laser, ultrasonic, bipolar) has expanded the scope of MIS significantly.  Robotic surgery, in particular, offers enhanced dexterity, precision, and three-dimensional visualization, enabling complex procedures previously confined to open surgery.  Concurrent improvements in suture materials, tissue adhesives, and minimally invasive anesthetic techniques have further contributed to reduced invasiveness and improved patient outcomes.  Practical applications are extensive, encompassing diverse specialties like general surgery, urology, gynecology, and cardiac surgery.  This continuous technological and methodological progress continues to refine MIS, promising further reductions in surgical trauma, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and improved patient quality of life.  Future research should focus on expanding the accessibility and affordability of advanced MIS techniques, while also addressing the limitations pertaining to dexterity and tactile feedback in certain applications.
