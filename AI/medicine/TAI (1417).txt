Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions and reduced tissue trauma, represents a significant advancement in surgical practice, dramatically improving patient outcomes and recovery times.  This paper traces the evolution of surgical techniques within MIS, highlighting key technological innovations and their impact on surgical approaches.  Early explorations into minimally invasive techniques can be traced back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, with advancements in endoscopy playing a pivotal role.  However, the true genesis of modern MIS is widely attributed to the development of laparoscopy in the mid-20th century, initially employed primarily for diagnostic purposes.  The subsequent decades witnessed a rapid expansion of laparoscopic techniques, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical skills.  This evolution encompassed not only the refinement of existing techniques but also the emergence of novel approaches such as robotic surgery and single-port access.  This paper will analyze this progression, exploring the challenges faced in each era, the technological breakthroughs that propelled progress, and the ongoing efforts to further refine and expand the capabilities of MIS, ultimately impacting the future of surgical care.
