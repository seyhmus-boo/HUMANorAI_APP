Climate change poses a significant and evolving threat to public health globally.  Recent research increasingly demonstrates a complex, multifaceted relationship extending beyond previously recognized impacts.  Extreme weather events, amplified by climate change, directly cause injury and mortality through heatwaves, floods, and wildfires, while indirectly impacting mental health through displacement and trauma.  Vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, are expanding their geographic ranges and transmission seasons, driven by altered temperature and precipitation patterns.  Changes in air quality, including increased ground-level ozone and particulate matter from wildfires, exacerbate respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  Food insecurity, resulting from altered agricultural yields and disrupted supply chains, contributes to malnutrition and related health problems.  Furthermore, emerging research highlights the synergistic effects of climate change with existing health inequalities, disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations.  Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaborations, integrating climate mitigation and adaptation strategies with public health interventions.  Innovative approaches, such as early warning systems for extreme weather and enhanced surveillance for infectious diseases, are crucial to mitigating the escalating health burden of climate change.
