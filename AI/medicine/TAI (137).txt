Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIST) represent a paradigm shift in surgical practice, prioritizing smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and expedited patient recovery compared to traditional open surgery. This paper explores the evolution of MIST, tracing its development from initial pioneering efforts to the sophisticated technologies employed today.  The initial adoption of laparoscopy, initially limited by technical challenges and a restricted field of view, paved the way for significant advancements.  These include the refinement of instrumentation, the incorporation of advanced imaging modalities such as robotic surgery and augmented reality, and the development of novel energy sources for precise tissue dissection.  This progress has expanded the applicability of MIST across a wide range of surgical specialties, encompassing cholecystectomies, appendectomies, and increasingly complex procedures in cardiac, thoracic, and neuro-surgical domains.  Practical applications extend beyond improved patient outcomes—reduced hospital stays, lower infection rates, and enhanced cosmesis—to encompass increased surgical efficiency and a broader accessibility of surgical care. This review analyzes the key technological milestones driving this evolution and discusses their impact on clinical practice, highlighting both the successes and remaining challenges in the ongoing refinement of MIST.
