Understanding the genetic basis of cancer has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Early research, focusing on identifying single oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes like *RAS* and *TP53*, laid the groundwork for targeted therapies.  However, the complexity of cancer, revealed through genomic sequencing, demonstrated the heterogeneity of tumors and the multitude of driver mutations involved.  This understanding fueled the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, enabling comprehensive genomic profiling of individual tumors.

This shift has facilitated the emergence of personalized cancer therapies, tailoring treatment based on a patient's unique tumor genetic profile.  Targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immunotherapy checkpoint inhibitors, have shown remarkable success in specific subsets of patients with identifiable mutations.  However, challenges remain, including the identification of optimal biomarkers for therapy selection, the management of acquired resistance, and the high cost of NGS and targeted therapies.  Despite these limitations, the integration of genomic data continues to drive progress, promising more effective, precise, and ultimately, more successful cancer treatments in the future.
