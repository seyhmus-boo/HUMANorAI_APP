Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are multifaceted and demand an interdisciplinary approach. This presentation explores the complex interplay of medical, legal, and philosophical perspectives shaping the allocation and procurement of organs. We will examine the persistent challenge of equitable distribution, analyzing the tension between utilitarian approaches maximizing overall benefit and deontological principles respecting individual rights.  The presentation further delves into the ethical implications of living donation, highlighting the vulnerabilities of potential donors and the need for robust informed consent procedures.  We will also address the ethical dilemmas arising from the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation, considering the risks of zoonotic disease transmission and the potential for exploitation of animals.  By integrating insights from bioethics, law, medicine, and social sciences, we aim to shed light on the persistent ethical challenges in organ transplantation, advocating for a more comprehensive and just system that prioritizes both individual autonomy and societal well-being. The discussion will conclude with potential avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration to enhance ethical practices in this crucial area of healthcare.
