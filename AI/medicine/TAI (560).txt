Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with disorders frequently misdiagnosed or attributed to "teenage angst."  However, recent decades have witnessed a significant shift, revealing escalating rates of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders among this population.  Contributing factors include societal pressures, increased academic competition, social media's impact, and evolving family structures.  These trends are reflected in rising hospital admissions and increased demand for mental health services.

Treatment approaches have evolved alongside this increased awareness.  While traditional methods like psychotherapy, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), remain crucial,  pharmacological interventions are also increasingly employed, particularly for severe conditions.  However, concerns regarding long-term effects and potential side effects necessitate careful consideration and individualized treatment plans.  Furthermore, integrated care models, incorporating family therapy and school-based interventions, demonstrate growing promise in fostering holistic support.  Despite advances, significant challenges remain, including access to timely and affordable care, especially for marginalized groups, highlighting the need for continued research and policy development in adolescent mental health.
