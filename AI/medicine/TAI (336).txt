Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges inherent in translating our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer into effective personalized medicine. While genomic sequencing readily identifies cancer-driving mutations, translating this information into targeted therapies faces significant hurdles.  Firstly, the sheer heterogeneity of cancers within and between patients presents a considerable challenge.  A single tumour can harbour multiple clonal populations, each with distinct genetic profiles and drug responses.  Accurately characterizing this intratumoral heterogeneity in pre-clinical models, particularly *in vivo*, remains a significant obstacle. Secondly, developing effective *in vitro* and *in vivo* models that accurately reflect the complexity of the tumour microenvironment, including the interplay of stromal cells and immune cells, is crucial but notoriously difficult.  Finally, even with accurate modelling, predicting clinical outcomes based on *in vitro* or *in vivo* data remains imprecise. This necessitates the development of robust predictive biomarkers and sophisticated statistical modelling to improve the translation of pre-clinical findings to the clinic.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is paramount for realizing the full potential of personalized cancer medicine.
