Cancer is a complex disease driven by somatic mutations accumulating across the genome.  Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, enabling the identification of driver mutations and the characterization of unique mutational signatures in individual tumors. This knowledge underpins the burgeoning field of personalized oncology.  Genome-wide analyses are revealing specific genetic alterations predicting response to targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors in lung cancer or immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma.  Furthermore, the identification of tumor-specific neoantigens allows for the development of personalized cancer vaccines.  However, challenges remain, including the identification of actionable mutations amongst passenger mutations, the complexities of tumor heterogeneity and microenvironment interactions, and the ethical considerations of genomic data management.  Despite these obstacles, integrating genomic profiling into clinical workflows allows for improved diagnosis, prognosis prediction, and treatment selection, leading to enhanced patient outcomes and a shift from a 'one-size-fits-all' approach to a truly personalized cancer medicine paradigm.  Future research will focus on refining predictive biomarkers and developing novel therapeutic strategies tailored to individual patients' genetic profiles.
