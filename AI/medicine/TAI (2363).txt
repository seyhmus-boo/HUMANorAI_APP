Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services, is rapidly transforming modern healthcare delivery.  Its core function lies in leveraging digital technologies, including video conferencing, remote patient monitoring (RPM), and mobile health (mHealth) applications, to extend access to care, particularly for geographically isolated or underserved populations.  Recent developments highlight its expanding role.  The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) within telemedicine platforms allows for automated diagnoses, personalized treatment recommendations, and efficient triage, enhancing both accuracy and speed of care.  Moreover, advancements in wearable sensor technology enable continuous RPM, facilitating proactive intervention and improved chronic disease management.  The COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated telemedicine adoption, demonstrating its viability as a primary care modality and highlighting its crucial role in crisis response. While challenges remain regarding data security, interoperability, and equitable access, ongoing developments suggest telemedicine will continue to play a progressively significant role in optimizing healthcare resource allocation and improving patient outcomes.
