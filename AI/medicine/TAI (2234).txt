Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgery, driven by advancements across multiple disciplines.  Early MIS, exemplified by laparoscopy, relied on rudimentary instrumentation and limited visualization, hindering complex procedures.  Subsequent evolution has been fueled by interdisciplinary collaboration.  Advances in optics, including high-definition endoscopy and 3D visualization, have significantly enhanced precision and dexterity.  Materials science contributed flexible endoscopes, smaller instruments, and biocompatible sutures, improving patient outcomes.  Robotics, a crucial interdisciplinary achievement integrating engineering, computer science, and medicine, enabled greater precision, dexterity, and ergonomic benefits for surgeons.  Furthermore, advancements in image processing and augmented reality provide surgeons with real-time anatomical data overlays, further refining accuracy.  The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) holds immense potential for pre-operative planning, intra-operative guidance, and personalized surgical strategies.  However, the complexity of MIS demands ongoing collaboration to address challenges such as training, cost-effectiveness, and the development of standardized safety protocols.  Future progress in MIS will undoubtedly continue to depend upon robust interdisciplinary efforts.
