Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents complex ethical dilemmas demanding careful consideration.  This abstract examines key ethical challenges within the field.  The principle of justice necessitates equitable allocation of scarce organs, raising questions regarding prioritization criteria and the potential for systemic biases based on socioeconomic status, race, or geographic location.  Autonomy, a cornerstone of medical ethics, is challenged by the need for informed consent from donors, particularly in cases of deceased donation, and the potential for coercion or undue influence on vulnerable family members.  Beneficence and non-maleficence require balancing the potential benefits of transplantation against the risks of surgery and immunosuppression, while also addressing issues of potential organ rejection and long-term health consequences.  Furthermore, the commercialization of organs, including the illicit organ trade, poses severe ethical concerns, violating the principles of respect for persons and justice.  Addressing these challenges requires robust ethical frameworks, transparent allocation policies, and ongoing dialogue among healthcare professionals, policymakers, and the public to ensure equitable access and responsible organ procurement practices.
