Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's ability to treat bacterial infections.  The emergence and spread of resistant strains are driven by evolutionary pressures, primarily the widespread use and misuse of antibiotics.  Experimentally characterizing AR presents several challenges.  Firstly, accurately tracking the evolution of resistance mechanisms within complex bacterial communities requires sophisticated high-throughput sequencing and bioinformatic analysis, often hampered by the presence of diverse, unculturable bacteria.  Secondly, predicting the emergence and spread of resistance requires complex epidemiological modelling that accurately accounts for factors like antibiotic usage patterns, bacterial transmission dynamics, and human behaviour, all of which vary considerably across geographical locations.  Thirdly, evaluating the effectiveness of novel antimicrobials and resistance-breaking strategies in complex in vivo environments faces challenges in mimicking the intricate host-pathogen interactions crucial for accurate prediction of clinical efficacy.  Ultimately, overcoming these experimental hurdles is crucial to developing effective strategies for combating the global crisis of AR.
