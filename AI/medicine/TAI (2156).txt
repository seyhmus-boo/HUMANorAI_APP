Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has emerged as a significant component of modern healthcare delivery. This review examines its expanding role, highlighting both benefits and limitations.  Telemedicine demonstrably improves access to care, particularly for geographically isolated or underserved populations, and offers enhanced convenience for patients.  Studies consistently show its efficacy in managing chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, with comparable outcomes to in-person care for many applications.  Furthermore, telemedicine can reduce healthcare costs through decreased travel expenses and hospital readmissions.  However, challenges persist, including the digital divide, concerns surrounding data security and privacy,  the need for robust regulatory frameworks, and limitations in physical examination capabilities.  The integration of telemedicine requires careful consideration of these factors, alongside the development of appropriate reimbursement models and standardized clinical protocols.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations to fully harness the transformative potential of telemedicine in achieving equitable and efficient healthcare access for all.
