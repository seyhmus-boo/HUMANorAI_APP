Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health, jeopardizing the effective treatment of bacterial infections and undermining decades of progress in healthcare.  This review examines the multifaceted nature of AR, exploring its underlying mechanisms, drivers, and consequential impacts on a global scale.  The widespread misuse and overuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, have accelerated the selection and dissemination of resistant strains across diverse bacterial species.  This has led to the emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens, rendering many common infections untreatable with existing therapies.  The resulting increase in morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs places a substantial burden on healthcare systems worldwide, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. This paper will analyze the complex interplay of factors contributing to the global AR crisis, critically assess current strategies for combating resistance, and discuss the urgent need for a coordinated, multi-sectoral approach encompassing surveillance, infection control, antibiotic stewardship, and the development of novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapeutic strategies to mitigate this pressing global health security challenge.
