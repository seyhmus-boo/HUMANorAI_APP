Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of microorganisms to withstand antimicrobial therapy, poses a significant and escalating global threat.  The widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture has driven the selection and proliferation of resistant strains across diverse bacterial species.  This phenomenon renders previously effective treatments ineffective, leading to prolonged illnesses, increased morbidity and mortality, and higher healthcare costs.  The global implications are profound, impacting healthcare systems' capacity to manage infectious diseases, threatening progress in surgery and cancer treatment, and potentially reversing decades of improvements in public health outcomes.  The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) pathogens necessitates a multi-pronged approach encompassing enhanced surveillance, prudent antibiotic stewardship, accelerated development of novel antimicrobials, and the exploration of alternative therapeutic strategies such as phage therapy and immunotherapy.  Failure to address AR effectively will result in a return to the pre-antibiotic era, jeopardizing global health security and socioeconomic stability.
