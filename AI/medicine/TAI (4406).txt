Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary response to mitigate its escalating impact on human and animal health, as well as the economy.  The rise of resistant pathogens is driven by complex interactions between overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agricultural practices promoting selective pressure, and environmental dissemination of resistant genes.  Understanding the complex interplay requires collaboration across microbiology, epidemiology, public health, veterinary science, environmental science, and social sciences.  Effective strategies necessitate integrated surveillance systems tracking resistance patterns across diverse settings, coupled with advancements in diagnostics and the development of novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapies (e.g., bacteriophages, immunotherapies).  Socioeconomic factors, including access to healthcare, antibiotic stewardship programs, and public health education, play a critical role in shaping antibiotic use behaviors and influencing the spread of resistance.  Addressing AR effectively demands a global, interdisciplinary, "One Health" approach focusing on sustainable antibiotic use, robust infection control, and promoting responsible innovation in both treatment and prevention strategies to preserve the efficacy of existing and future antimicrobials.
