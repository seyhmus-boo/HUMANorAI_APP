This review summarizes current trends and treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents, a population experiencing a concerning rise in prevalence.  Anxiety and depression remain the most prevalent disorders, with significant increases observed in recent years, potentially linked to societal factors such as increased social media use and academic pressure.  Eating disorders, self-harm, and substance abuse also present significant challenges. Treatment approaches are increasingly emphasizing a holistic and integrated care model, moving beyond traditional individual therapy.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) remain cornerstones, but newer interventions such as mindfulness-based approaches and digital therapeutics are gaining traction.  Family-based interventions are crucial, particularly for younger adolescents.  Access to timely and appropriate care remains a major barrier, highlighted by significant disparities based on socioeconomic status, race, and geographic location. Further research is needed to investigate the long-term effects of emerging treatments and address systemic inequities hindering access to effective mental healthcare for this vulnerable population.  Early intervention and a multidisciplinary approach are essential to improve outcomes and reduce the long-term burden of mental health disorders in adolescents.
