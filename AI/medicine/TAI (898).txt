Organ transplantation presents a complex ethical landscape, riddled with dilemmas analogous to resource allocation in a lifeboat scenario.  The scarcity of organs necessitates prioritization, mirroring the difficult choices faced when limited life vests must be distributed amongst shipwreck survivors.  Who deserves priority â€“ the young, the wealthy, those with the greatest potential contribution to society?  This echoes utilitarian versus deontological ethical frameworks: maximizing overall societal benefit versus adhering to principles of fairness and equal opportunity irrespective of outcome.

Further complicating matters are issues of informed consent and autonomy.  A living donor's decision, akin to donating blood, involves a potential risk to their health, demanding rigorous ethical scrutiny to ensure genuine voluntariness and comprehension of risks.  Conversely, deceased donation raises questions about the definition of death and the potential exploitation of vulnerable individuals, mirroring concerns around the ethics of conducting research on incapacitated participants.  Finally, the financial implications and potential for organ trafficking introduce a market-based analogy, raising concerns about equity and the commodification of the human body, a concept that clashes with the inherent dignity and value of human life.
