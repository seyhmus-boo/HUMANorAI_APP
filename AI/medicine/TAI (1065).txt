Organ transplantation offers a life-saving intervention for individuals with end-stage organ failure, yet its practice is fraught with complex ethical dilemmas.  This paper examines the multifaceted ethical considerations inherent in the organ transplantation process, focusing on three key areas: donor consent and autonomy, equitable allocation of scarce resources, and the potential for exploitation and coercion within the system.  We critically analyze the existing legal and ethical frameworks governing organ donation and transplantation, highlighting inconsistencies and areas requiring further refinement.  Specifically, we explore the tension between respecting the autonomy of potential donors (both living and deceased) and the imperative to maximize the number of successful transplants.  Further, we address the challenges of establishing just and transparent allocation criteria, considering factors such as medical urgency, waiting list time, and societal contribution.  Finally, we investigate the vulnerability of marginalized populations to exploitation, focusing on issues of informed consent, potential financial incentives, and the risks of coercion.  This analysis aims to contribute to a more nuanced and ethically robust approach to organ transplantation, emphasizing the need for ongoing dialogue and the development of ethically sound policies and practices.
