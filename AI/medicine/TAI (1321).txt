Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving field, demanding continuous critical appraisal.  This presentation will explore key ethical dilemmas inherent in the process, from equitable allocation of scarce resources to the challenges of informed consent and potential conflicts of interest. We will examine the tension between maximizing the number of successful transplants and upholding the principles of justice and autonomy.  The presentation will specifically address the ethical implications of various allocation systems, including utilitarian approaches prioritizing the greatest good and deontological approaches emphasizing individual rights.  Practical applications will be discussed, including the role of ethics committees in ensuring fair and transparent decision-making, strategies for improving communication with potential donors and recipients, and the development of robust policies addressing issues of coercion and undue influence.  Further, we will consider the impact of emerging technologies, such as xenotransplantation and 3D bioprinting, on existing ethical frameworks and the necessity for proactive adaptation of guidelines to maintain ethical integrity within the field.  Ultimately, this presentation aims to stimulate dialogue and encourage a nuanced understanding of the multifaceted ethical landscape of organ transplantation.
