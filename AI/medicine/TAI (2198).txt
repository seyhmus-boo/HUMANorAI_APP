While a purely quantum mechanical explanation of antibiotic resistance is currently beyond our capabilities, a quantum chemical perspective can illuminate certain aspects.  Antibiotic efficacy hinges on specific molecular interactions, governed by the principles of quantum mechanics.  The strength of these interactions, including binding affinities and reaction rates, are determined by electronic structure and vibrational frequencies, calculable using quantum mechanical methods.  Mutations conferring resistance subtly alter the target molecule's electronic structure, weakening the interaction with the antibiotic. This might manifest as altered charge distributions, impacting electrostatic interactions, or changes in conformational flexibility, influencing the steric complementarity between antibiotic and target.  

Globally, the spread of resistant strains is accelerated by factors like gene transfer, often facilitated by relatively weak intermolecular forces between DNA molecules, processes which can be modeled using quantum mechanical principles. From a broader perspective, the development of new antibiotics necessitates a deep understanding of these molecular interactions at a quantum level to design drugs that overcome resistance mechanisms.  Failure to address antibiotic resistance through rational drug design based on such understanding will result in a global health crisis of immense proportions, impacting healthcare systems and global economies significantly.
