Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  The escalating prevalence of resistant pathogens, driven by factors like overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal health, and agricultural practices, transcends purely medical concerns.  Economic implications are substantial, impacting healthcare systems through increased treatment costs and prolonged hospital stays.  Agricultural productivity is also affected, with reduced livestock yields due to infections resistant to traditional treatments.

Environmental science plays a crucial role, as antibiotic residues in soil and water contribute to the selection and dissemination of resistant genes.  Understanding the ecological dynamics of AR requires collaboration between microbiologists, ecologists, and environmental engineers.  Furthermore, the social sciences are critical in addressing the behavioural aspects of antibiotic use, informing public health interventions targeted at improving prescribing practices and promoting responsible antibiotic stewardship.  Effective global governance necessitates legal frameworks, international collaborations, and data sharing across disciplines to monitor resistance patterns, develop novel therapies, and implement effective control strategies.  Ultimately, tackling AR necessitates a truly integrated and interdisciplinary strategy transcending national boundaries and sectoral silos.
