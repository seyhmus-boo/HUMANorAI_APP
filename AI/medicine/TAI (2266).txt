Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, impacting populations globally through both direct and indirect mechanisms. This presentation explores the complex interplay between environmental changes and human health outcomes.  We will examine direct impacts such as increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the expansion of vector-borne diseases (e.g., malaria, dengue fever), and the worsening of air quality leading to respiratory illnesses.  Indirect consequences, including malnutrition due to agricultural disruptions, mental health challenges arising from displacement and trauma related to extreme weather events, and the exacerbation of existing health inequalities, will also be discussed.  Furthermore, we will analyze the challenges of effective mitigation and adaptation strategies, highlighting the need for integrated approaches that address both climate change and public health within a framework of social justice and equity.  The presentation concludes by emphasizing the urgency of collaborative action across sectors, including public health, climate science, and policymaking, to minimize the health impacts of climate change and build climate-resilient health systems.
