Cancer is a complex disease characterized by uncontrolled cellular proliferation and genomic instability, driven by a multitude of genetic and environmental factors.  Significant progress in understanding the genetic basis of cancer has fueled the development of personalized medicine approaches, aiming to tailor cancer treatment to the unique genomic profile of each patient. This review examines recent advances in elucidating the intricate genetic landscape of various cancer types, highlighting the roles of driver mutations, oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and epigenetic modifications.  We explore the translational impact of these discoveries on the development of targeted therapies, including small molecule inhibitors, monoclonal antibodies, and immunotherapy strategies.  Furthermore, we discuss the evolving role of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies in facilitating comprehensive genomic profiling and the challenges associated with integrating this information into clinical decision-making.  This paper emphasizes the current limitations and future directions of personalized cancer medicine, particularly regarding the identification of predictive biomarkers, the management of treatment resistance, and the ethical considerations surrounding access to and implementation of these sophisticated technologies.
