This presentation explores the emerging field of quantum biology and its implications for understanding the influence of nutrition on chronic disease prevention.  While classical biochemistry provides a strong foundation for understanding metabolic pathways, a quantum mechanical perspective offers a more nuanced view of crucial biological processes underpinning health and disease.  We will examine the role of quantum phenomena, such as electron tunneling and entanglement, in enzyme catalysis and redox reactions vital for nutrient metabolism and cellular function.  Specifically, we will discuss how dietary deficiencies impacting the availability of essential micronutrients can disrupt these delicate quantum processes. This disruption may contribute to oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and ultimately, the development of chronic diseases like cancer and cardiovascular disease.  The presentation will further explore the potential for targeted nutritional interventions designed to optimize quantum coherence within biological systems, thus promoting cellular resilience and disease resistance. This interdisciplinary approach highlights the necessity of integrating quantum biological principles into our understanding of nutrition and its impact on human health, opening new avenues for disease prevention strategies.  Finally, we will briefly discuss future research directions and the challenges involved in applying quantum mechanical principles to nutritional science.
