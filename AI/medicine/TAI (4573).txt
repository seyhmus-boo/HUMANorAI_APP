The evolution of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques has been profoundly shaped by interdisciplinary collaborations, transcending traditional surgical boundaries.  Early laparoscopic procedures, pioneered in the late 20th century, relied heavily on advancements in optics and imaging, driven by engineering and physics.  The development of smaller, more maneuverable instruments demanded input from materials science and mechanical engineering, leading to improved ergonomics and precision.  Simultaneously, advances in anesthesia, fueled by pharmacology and physiology research, enabled safer and more comfortable procedures for patients.  The integration of computer technology, especially image-guided surgery and robotic assistance, further revolutionized MIS.  Computer science and robotics engineering contributed significantly to the precision and dexterity of surgical interventions, minimizing trauma and improving outcomes.  Moreover,  the integration of real-time imaging, such as ultrasound and fluorescence imaging, necessitates close collaboration between surgeons, radiologists, and biomedical engineers.  This interdisciplinary approach continues to be crucial, driving the development of novel techniques like natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) and single-port access surgery, reflecting a constant pursuit of less invasive, more patient-centric surgical approaches.
