Minimally invasive surgical techniques (MIS), characterized by smaller incisions, reduced trauma, and faster recovery times, represent a paradigm shift in surgical practice.  This paper explores the evolution of these techniques, tracing their development from rudimentary approaches to the sophisticated technologies employed today.  The historical roots of MIS can be found in early endoscopy, with pioneers like Philipp Bozzini utilizing rudimentary instruments for internal examinations in the early 19th century.  However, the true genesis of modern MIS lies in the latter half of the 20th century, with the advent of laparoscopy in the 1980s significantly advancing the field.  Initially limited to diagnostic procedures, laparoscopy rapidly expanded to encompass a wide range of therapeutic interventions, driven by technological advancements in optics, instrumentation, and imaging. This evolution has been characterized not only by refinements in existing techniques, such as improved suture methods and energy sources, but also by the introduction of entirely new approaches, including robotic surgery and single-port access. This paper will analyze the key milestones in this progression, examining the technological innovations, clinical applications, and limitations associated with each stage of development, culminating in a discussion of current trends and future directions in MIS.
