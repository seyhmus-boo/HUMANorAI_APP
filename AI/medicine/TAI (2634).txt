Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), a paradigm shift in surgical practice, has undergone a remarkable evolution since its inception.  Early attempts, such as laparoscopy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, were largely hampered by technological limitations.  Limited visualization and dexterity restricted application to specific procedures.  The mid-20th century witnessed significant advancements, primarily driven by improvements in optical technology and the development of specialized instruments.  Endoscopes, initially rigid, transitioned to flexible designs, enhancing access to previously inaccessible areas. 

The late 20th and early 21st centuries marked a period of exponential growth, characterized by the integration of robotic surgery, advanced imaging modalities (e.g., 3D laparoscopy, fluorescence imaging), and sophisticated energy sources.  Robotic systems, offering enhanced precision and dexterity, revolutionized complex procedures.  Simultaneously, the development of smaller, more versatile instruments expanded the scope of MIS.  Despite significant progress, challenges remain, including the learning curve associated with new techniques, the potential for complications, and the high cost of advanced technology.  Future research will likely focus on further miniaturization, artificial intelligence integration, and improved training methodologies to optimize patient outcomes and expand the application of MIS across a wider range of surgical specialties.
