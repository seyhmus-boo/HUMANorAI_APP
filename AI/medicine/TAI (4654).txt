Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating threat to global health, security, and economic stability.  This presentation will examine the multifaceted implications of this crisis, highlighting recent developments and their consequences.  The rise of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, including *Enterobacteriaceae*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, and *Acinetobacter baumannii*, is driving increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs globally.  Recent research underscores the critical role of environmental dissemination of resistance genes, challenging the traditional focus on clinical settings.  We will explore the contribution of agricultural practices, wastewater treatment, and pollution to the spread of AR, emphasizing the urgent need for One Health approaches.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss promising advancements in combating AR, including novel antibiotic discovery strategies, phage therapy advancements, and the development of innovative diagnostic tools for rapid identification of resistant strains.  Finally, we will address the crucial need for global collaboration, policy changes, and public health initiatives to effectively mitigate this critical global challenge and safeguard future healthcare.
