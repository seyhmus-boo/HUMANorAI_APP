Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have undergone a dramatic evolution, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical principles. Early MIS procedures, primarily laparoscopic, relied on 2D imaging and rigid instruments, limiting dexterity and precision.  Subsequent development of smaller instruments with enhanced articulation and improved visualization, including 3D laparoscopy and robotic-assisted surgery, significantly expanded the scope of MIS.  The introduction of natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) aimed to eliminate external incisions entirely, although its widespread adoption remains limited by technical challenges.  Concurrent progress in energy sources, such as advanced bipolar and ultrasonic devices,  has improved hemostasis and tissue dissection.  Furthermore, the integration of augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and intraoperative imaging modalities like fluorescence-guided surgery enhances real-time visualization and improves surgical accuracy.  Future directions in MIS are focused on further miniaturization, improved ergonomics, personalized surgical planning via AI, and the development of novel techniques to overcome current limitations of access and dexterity. This continuous evolution promises to enhance patient outcomes through reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic results.
