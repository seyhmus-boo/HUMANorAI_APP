Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's ability to treat bacterial infections. This presentation will explore the multifaceted nature of AR and its far-reaching consequences.  We will examine recent developments contributing to its rise, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate infection control practices.  The emergence of novel resistance mechanisms, such as plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfer and the evolution of multi-drug resistant (MDR) superbugs like carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), will be discussed.

Furthermore, the presentation will highlight the substantial global health and economic implications of AR.  Increased morbidity and mortality rates, prolonged hospital stays, and the escalating costs associated with developing and implementing novel therapeutic strategies will be addressed.  Recent advancements in combating AR, including the development of novel antibiotics, alternative therapeutic approaches such as bacteriophages and CRISPR-Cas systems, and improved stewardship programs, will be reviewed.  Finally, we will emphasize the urgent need for a coordinated global response involving effective surveillance, responsible antibiotic use, and accelerated research and development to mitigate the impending crisis posed by AR.
