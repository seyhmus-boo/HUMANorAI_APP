Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents complex ethical dilemmas.  A central concern revolves around equitable allocation of scarce organs, often necessitating the use of prioritization systems.  These systems, while aiming for fairness, can inadvertently disadvantage certain groups based on factors like age, socioeconomic status, or geographic location, raising concerns about justice and discrimination.  Recent developments in predictive modelling and artificial intelligence aim to improve allocation transparency and fairness, but ethical scrutiny remains crucial to prevent algorithmic bias.

Another significant challenge lies in informed consent, particularly in cases of deceased donation. Ensuring family members understand the process and their rights while respecting the potential donor's wishes, particularly if previously unexpressed, is paramount.  The increasing use of living donation introduces additional ethical layers, including the potential for coercion and the need for rigorous assessment of donor vulnerability and capacity for informed consent.  Furthermore,  the emerging field of xenotransplantation (using animal organs) presents novel ethical complexities related to animal welfare, zoonotic disease transmission, and the potential for unforeseen long-term consequences.  Ongoing ethical debate and robust regulatory frameworks are essential to navigate these evolving challenges.
