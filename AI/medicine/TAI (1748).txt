Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, is rapidly transforming modern healthcare delivery. This review examines its multifaceted role, highlighting both its potential benefits and limitations.  Studies consistently demonstrate telemedicine's efficacy in improving access to care, particularly for geographically isolated or underserved populations, enhancing patient convenience, and reducing healthcare costs through decreased travel and hospital readmissions.  Furthermore, telemedicine facilitates remote patient monitoring, enabling proactive management of chronic conditions and timely intervention.  However, challenges persist, including concerns about digital literacy disparities, the need for robust cybersecurity measures to ensure data privacy and integrity, and the establishment of clear regulatory frameworks for licensing and reimbursement.  While technological advancements continue to enhance telemedicine capabilities, addressing these limitations is crucial for its successful integration and equitable implementation within existing healthcare systems.  Future research should focus on optimizing telemedicine platforms, evaluating long-term outcomes, and developing strategies to overcome digital divides and ensure healthcare equity.
