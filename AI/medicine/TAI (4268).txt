Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and multifaceted global challenge, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  The problem transcends purely medical concerns, encompassing agricultural practices, environmental pollution, and socioeconomic factors.  Research highlights the crucial role of agricultural antibiotic use in driving the selection and spread of resistant strains, underscoring the need for veterinary and agricultural scientists to collaborate with medical researchers.  Furthermore, the environmental dissemination of resistant bacteria and genes via wastewater and agricultural runoff necessitates the engagement of environmental scientists and engineers in developing effective wastewater treatment strategies and mitigating contamination.  Economically, the escalating healthcare costs associated with treating AR infections and the potential for reduced productivity demand economic analysis to guide policy decisions on resource allocation and infection control.  Effectively combating AR thus necessitates a unified front involving medical, agricultural, environmental, and economic expertise.  Collaboration across these disciplines is paramount for developing effective surveillance systems, designing innovative therapeutic strategies, and formulating evidence-based public health policies to curb the global threat of AR.
