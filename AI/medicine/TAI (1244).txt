Adolescent mental health is a critical public health concern, characterized by rising prevalence rates and complex treatment challenges. This presentation examines recent trends in mental health disorders among adolescents, focusing on the increasing incidence of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders. We will explore contributing factors, including societal pressures, technological influences, and biological vulnerabilities, highlighting the interplay between these factors in shaping mental health trajectories.  The presentation will then review current evidence-based treatments, encompassing pharmacological interventions, various psychotherapies (such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Dialectical Behavior Therapy), and family-based approaches. A particular emphasis will be placed on the practical applications of these treatments within diverse clinical settings, including school-based initiatives and community mental health services. We will discuss the importance of early intervention, integrated care models, and the role of technology in enhancing accessibility and treatment adherence. Finally, we will briefly address future research directions necessary to improve the understanding and management of adolescent mental health disorders and promote positive youth development.  This presentation aims to equip clinicians and educators with actionable insights for effectively addressing the growing mental health needs of adolescents.
