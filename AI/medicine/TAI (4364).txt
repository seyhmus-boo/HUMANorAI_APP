Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving area demanding continuous scrutiny. This presentation explores key ethical dilemmas arising throughout the transplantation process, from organ procurement to allocation and post-transplant care.  We will examine the principles of autonomy, beneficence, non-maleficence, and justice in the context of donor consent, particularly regarding deceased donation and the potential for coercion or undue influence on grieving families. The challenges of equitable organ allocation amidst scarcity will be discussed, highlighting the tension between medical urgency and social justice.  Further, we will address ethical issues related to transplant tourism, the commodification of organs, and the potential for discrimination based on factors such as age or lifestyle choices.  Finally, the presentation will briefly consider the implications of emerging technologies, such as xenotransplantation and 3D-printed organs, on existing ethical frameworks and the need for proactive and inclusive policy development to ensure equitable and just access to life-saving transplantation procedures.  The aim is to stimulate discussion and encourage multidisciplinary collaboration in navigating these critical ethical challenges.
