Adolescent mental health disorders, including depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders, are exhibiting concerning upward trends globally, often linked to societal factors like increased academic pressure and social media usage.  Effective treatment requires an interdisciplinary approach, recognizing the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social influences.  Biological interventions, such as medication management by psychiatrists, address neurochemical imbalances.  Psychologists and psychotherapists provide crucial psychological interventions, employing evidence-based therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to address maladaptive thought patterns and emotional regulation.  Social workers play a vital role in addressing socio-environmental factors, connecting adolescents with support systems and advocating for systemic changes within schools and communities.  Furthermore, collaboration with educators facilitates early identification and school-based interventions.  This holistic, integrated care model, encompassing contributions from medicine, psychology, social work, and education, enhances treatment efficacy and fosters long-term mental well-being in adolescents.  Future research should focus on strengthening these interdisciplinary collaborations and developing culturally sensitive interventions.
