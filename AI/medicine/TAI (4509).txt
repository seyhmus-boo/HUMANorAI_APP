Organ transplantation remains a life-saving medical intervention, yet its practice is fraught with complex ethical dilemmas.  This abstract examines key ethical considerations, highlighting recent developments shaping the field.  The persistent global shortage of organs necessitates ongoing debate surrounding equitable allocation, with algorithms increasingly employed to mitigate bias and maximize utility.  However, concerns persist regarding fairness and transparency in these algorithmic approaches, demanding robust validation and public engagement.  The ethical implications of living donation, particularly vulnerable populations' potential for coercion, require stricter safeguards and enhanced informed consent processes.  Recent advances in xenotransplantation, while promising, raise significant ethical challenges concerning animal welfare, the potential for zoonotic disease transmission, and the definition of human-animal chimeras.  Furthermore, the increasing use of artificial organs introduces new ethical dimensions related to resource allocation, accessibility, and the potential for exacerbating existing health inequalities.  Addressing these multifaceted challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration among ethicists, clinicians, policymakers, and the public to ensure just and equitable access to life-saving transplantation.
