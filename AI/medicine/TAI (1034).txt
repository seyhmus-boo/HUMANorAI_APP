Cancer is a complex disease driven by a heterogeneous accumulation of genetic alterations.  Advances in genomic sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic basis of cancer, revealing a myriad of driver mutations, copy number variations, and epigenetic modifications underlying tumorigenesis. This wealth of data fuels the burgeoning field of personalized oncology, aiming to tailor cancer treatment strategies to individual patient characteristics. This review examines recent progress in elucidating the genetic landscape of various cancers, focusing on the identification of actionable mutations and their implications for targeted therapies. We explore the integration of genomic profiling into clinical decision-making, including the selection of appropriate chemotherapeutic agents, immunotherapy, and other targeted interventions.  Furthermore, we discuss the challenges and limitations of personalized medicine, such as the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive genomic testing, the identification of truly predictive biomarkers, and the development of effective strategies to address drug resistance.  Ultimately, we highlight promising future directions in research, including the development of novel therapeutic targets, improved predictive modelling, and the integration of multi-omics data to enhance the precision and efficacy of personalized cancer treatment.
