Organ transplantation, a life-saving medical intervention, presents complex ethical dilemmas.  This review examines key ethical considerations, focusing on recent developments.  The persistent shortage of donor organs necessitates ongoing scrutiny of allocation systems, with debate continuing regarding prioritizing patients based on factors beyond medical urgency, such as age or lifestyle.  Recent advancements in xenotransplantation, utilizing animal organs, raise significant ethical questions concerning animal welfare and the potential for zoonotic disease transmission, requiring robust regulatory frameworks.

Furthermore, informed consent processes, particularly concerning living donors, require heightened attention, ensuring transparency and mitigating potential coercion.  The rise of commercialization in some regions exacerbates existing inequities, necessitating stronger international cooperation to prevent exploitation and ensure equitable access.  Finally, the evolving understanding of brain death and its implications for organ procurement remains a subject of ongoing philosophical and medical debate.  Addressing these ethical challenges through interdisciplinary collaboration, robust legislation, and transparent public discourse is crucial to ensuring the responsible and equitable advancement of organ transplantation.
