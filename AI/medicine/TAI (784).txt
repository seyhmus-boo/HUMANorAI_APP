The relationship between climate change and public health is a complex and increasingly critical area of interdisciplinary research.  Studies highlight a multifaceted interplay, demanding collaboration across disciplines including climatology, epidemiology, environmental health, and social sciences.  Climate change acts as a "threat multiplier," exacerbating existing health inequalities and creating novel challenges.  Increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events directly cause injury and death, while indirectly impacting mental health through displacement and trauma.  Shifting temperature and precipitation patterns alter the geographic distribution and prevalence of infectious diseases, impacting vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever.  Air pollution, worsened by climate change, contributes significantly to respiratory and cardiovascular diseases.  Furthermore, food insecurity and malnutrition, resulting from altered agricultural yields, negatively affect population health, particularly in vulnerable communities.  Addressing this complex relationship requires integrated approaches that incorporate climate adaptation strategies into public health planning, promoting sustainable development, and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration for effective mitigation and risk reduction strategies.  Future research should focus on quantifying the health burdens, improving predictive modelling, and developing equitable and effective interventions.
