Artificial intelligence (AI) holds transformative potential for medical diagnostics, offering faster, more accurate, and potentially more accessible diagnoses. However, translating this potential into clinical practice faces significant experimental challenges. This presentation explores key limitations in the application of AI to healthcare diagnostics.  We will examine the difficulties associated with data acquisition, focusing on the need for large, high-quality, and diverse datasets representative of real-world patient populations. The inherent biases present in existing datasets and the subsequent risk of perpetuating health inequalities through algorithmic bias will be addressed.  Furthermore, the challenges of model validation and generalizability will be discussed, emphasizing the critical need for robust testing across diverse patient cohorts and clinical settings to ensure reliable performance.  Finally, we will highlight the complexities of integrating AI diagnostic tools into existing healthcare workflows, including considerations of clinician acceptance, regulatory approval, and the ethical implications of algorithmic decision-making in a human-centered healthcare system. Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for the safe and equitable implementation of AI in medical diagnostics.
