Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This presentation explores the significant evolution of MIS techniques, emphasizing the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving advancements.  Early MIS relied heavily on laparoscopy, limited by two-dimensional visualization and instrument dexterity.  However, the integration of robotics, advanced imaging modalities (e.g., 3D laparoscopy, augmented reality), and sophisticated instrumentation has dramatically expanded capabilities.  The development of robotic surgical systems, for example, requires collaboration between surgeons, engineers, and computer scientists, yielding enhanced precision and control.  Similarly, the incorporation of image-guided surgery necessitates close collaboration with radiologists and medical physicists.  Furthermore, the increasing complexity of MIS procedures necessitates improved pre-operative planning involving anaesthesiologists, intensivists, and pathologists to optimize patient selection and post-operative management.  This presentation will analyze key technological breakthroughs, highlighting the synergistic effects of interdisciplinary research and development that have propelled MIS from a niche technique to a cornerstone of modern surgery.  Finally, future directions focusing on artificial intelligence and personalized medicine will be discussed, emphasizing the continued need for strong interdisciplinary partnerships.
