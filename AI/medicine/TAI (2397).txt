Organ transplantation, while a life-saving medical marvel, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  Central to these is the allocation of scarce organs, demanding a just and equitable system.  Utilitarian approaches prioritize maximizing benefit, potentially leading to discriminatory practices based on factors like age or lifestyle.  Deontological frameworks, conversely, emphasize the inherent right to life and bodily autonomy, necessitating informed consent and prohibiting coercion.  

Practical application of these principles manifests in waiting list prioritization criteria, which often incorporate medical urgency and predicted post-transplant survival.  However, debates persist regarding the inclusion of factors such as social contribution or adherence to healthy lifestyles.  Furthermore, the ethics of living donation raise issues of vulnerability and potential exploitation, highlighting the need for rigorous assessment of donor autonomy and capacity to consent.  Ultimately, navigating these ethical complexities requires a nuanced approach balancing societal well-being with individual rights.
