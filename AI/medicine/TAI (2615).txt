Cancer, a complex disease, arises from somatic mutations accumulating within a cell's genome.  Recent advances in genomic sequencing have revolutionized our understanding of this genetic basis, revealing the heterogeneous nature of even single tumour types.  This detailed genetic profiling allows for the identification of specific driver mutations and oncogenic pathways unique to individual patients.  This understanding underpins the burgeoning field of personalized oncology.

Advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies now enable comprehensive genomic characterization of tumours, including whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing, as well as RNA sequencing to assess gene expression profiles.  This facilitates the identification of targetable mutations, informing treatment decisions based on individual genetic profiles, moving away from one-size-fits-all chemotherapy approaches.  Furthermore, liquid biopsies, offering less invasive sampling of circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), are increasingly utilized for early detection, monitoring treatment response, and identifying drug resistance mechanisms.  These breakthroughs promise more effective, less toxic cancer therapies tailored to each patient's unique genetic landscape.
