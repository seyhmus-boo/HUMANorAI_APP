Climate change poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health. This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between a changing climate and human health outcomes, moving beyond simple correlations to highlight causal pathways. We will examine the direct impacts of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and wildfires, on morbidity and mortality, emphasizing the disproportionate burden borne by vulnerable populations.  Further, the indirect effects, including changes in vector-borne disease transmission, air quality degradation, and food insecurity, will be discussed.  The presentation will also consider the mental health consequences of climate-related disasters and displacement.

Practical applications of this research are crucial.  We will highlight the development of early warning systems for heat-related illnesses and the importance of climate-resilient healthcare infrastructure.  Furthermore, we will discuss the role of public health interventions in mitigating climate change's impact, including strategies for promoting climate-conscious behaviors, improving access to clean water and sanitation, and strengthening community resilience.  Finally, we advocate for incorporating climate change considerations into all aspects of public health planning and policy to ensure effective and equitable adaptation and mitigation strategies.
