The evolution of minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques represents a significant advancement in surgical practice, driven by interdisciplinary collaborations.  Early MIS, exemplified by laparoscopy, relied primarily on advancements in optics and instrumentation from engineering and materials science.  However, the field has expanded dramatically, incorporating expertise from diverse disciplines.  Computer science has been crucial in developing robotic surgery platforms and image-guided navigation systems, enhancing precision and dexterity beyond the limitations of human hands.  Biomedical engineering has played a key role in designing smaller, more sophisticated instruments and developing novel biocompatible materials for implants and sutures.  Advances in imaging techniques, such as high-definition endoscopy and 3D imaging, originating from medical physics and radiology, allow for better visualization and real-time monitoring during procedures.  Furthermore, advancements in anesthesia and postoperative care, developed through collaborative efforts with anesthesiologists and critical care specialists, have significantly improved patient safety and outcomes.  This interdisciplinary synergy has propelled MIS from a niche approach to a widely adopted standard across various surgical specialties, ultimately leading to reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved patient experience.  Ongoing research continues to refine these techniques and explore novel approaches, such as single-port surgery and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES).
