Antibiotic resistance, the ability of microorganisms to withstand antimicrobial treatments, poses a significant and escalating global health threat.  The widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture has driven selective pressure, fostering the evolution and dissemination of resistant strains. This phenomenon transcends geographical boundaries, facilitated by global travel and trade.  Consequent increases in morbidity and mortality associated with resistant infections are placing immense strain on healthcare systems worldwide.  The economic burden, encompassing increased treatment costs, prolonged hospital stays, and reduced productivity, is substantial.  Failure to effectively address antibiotic resistance will undermine progress in treating infectious diseases, reversing decades of advancements in public health and potentially jeopardizing the success of future surgical procedures and cancer therapies.  Urgent implementation of stewardship programs, coupled with the development of novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapeutic strategies, are critical to mitigating this global crisis.
