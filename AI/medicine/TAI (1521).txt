Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This paper examines the complex and evolving relationship between climate change and its impacts on human health, moving beyond simple correlations to explore nuanced causal pathways and differential vulnerabilities.  We review existing literature to synthesize the evidence linking climate-driven changes in temperature, precipitation patterns, and extreme weather events to a range of adverse health outcomes. These outcomes encompass both direct effects, such as heat-related mortality and injuries from extreme weather, and indirect consequences, including the increased burden of infectious diseases, respiratory illnesses exacerbated by air pollution, and malnutrition due to agricultural disruption.  Furthermore, the paper considers the social determinants of health, exploring how existing inequalities in access to resources and healthcare exacerbate the vulnerability of specific populations to climate change impacts.  Finally, we discuss implications for public health policy and interventions, highlighting the urgent need for proactive adaptation and mitigation strategies to protect human health from the escalating effects of a changing climate.
