Organ transplantation, while a life-saving procedure, presents profound ethical dilemmas.  Central concerns revolve around the allocation of scarce organs, often necessitating prioritization frameworks.  Recent developments emphasize the move towards more equitable systems, addressing historical biases embedded in allocation algorithms.  For instance,  incorporating social determinants of health into scoring systems aims to mitigate disparities impacting marginalized communities.

Another key area is informed consent.  Ensuring truly voluntary donation, free from coercion, particularly in vulnerable populations, remains challenging.  The increasing use of living donors necessitates rigorous ethical review to prevent exploitation.  Furthermore, debates continue regarding the definition of death, especially with advancements in brain death criteria, prompting nuanced discussions on the irreversibility of neurological function.  Finally,  the burgeoning field of xenotransplantation – using animal organs – introduces novel ethical complexities around animal welfare, potential zoonotic disease transmission, and the moral permissibility of interspecies organ transfer.  Addressing these issues requires ongoing interdisciplinary dialogue involving medical professionals, ethicists, and policymakers.
