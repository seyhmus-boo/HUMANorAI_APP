Cancer's genetic heterogeneity presents a significant challenge to the promise of personalized medicine. While advancements in next-generation sequencing have enabled comprehensive genomic profiling of tumors, translating this data into effective, targeted therapies remains experimentally complex.  Identifying driver mutations amidst passenger mutations requires sophisticated bioinformatic analysis, prone to false positives and negatives, hindering accurate therapeutic selection. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of cancer genomes, with intratumoral heterogeneity and clonal evolution, complicates treatment strategies.  A single biopsy may not represent the entire tumor's genetic landscape, leading to treatment resistance and relapse.  

Developing robust preclinical models that accurately reflect the complexity of individual patient tumors is another crucial hurdle.  Traditional cell lines and xenograft models often fail to capture the intricate tumor microenvironment and stromal interactions crucial for therapeutic response.  The generation of patient-derived organoids and xenografts, while promising, faces challenges in reproducibility and scalability.  Finally, the high cost and accessibility limitations of comprehensive genomic profiling necessitate further research into cost-effective, high-throughput screening methods to facilitate widespread implementation of personalized cancer medicine.  Overcoming these experimental limitations is crucial to realizing the full potential of this rapidly evolving field.
