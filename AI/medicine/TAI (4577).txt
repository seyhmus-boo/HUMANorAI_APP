Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the concerning rise of mental health disorders in adolescents.  Think of adolescence as a bridge – a period of significant transition, often fraught with challenges navigating newfound independence and identity.  Unfortunately, for many, this bridge becomes precarious, with the increased prevalence of anxiety and depression likened to cracks appearing in its structure.  

These cracks, manifested as disorders like generalized anxiety disorder or major depressive episode, are not solely the result of individual fragility. Societal pressures – academic competition (imagine the bridge overloaded with weight) and social media's impact (consider the erosion caused by constant exposure to idealized lifestyles) – exacerbate vulnerability.

Treatment approaches are evolving, mirroring efforts to repair this damaged bridge.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) acts as scaffolding, providing adolescents with the tools to manage negative thought patterns.  Medication, in certain cases, functions like reinforcing the bridge's foundations, stabilizing the individual's emotional state.  Early intervention, akin to preventative maintenance, is crucial to minimise long-term damage and facilitate successful navigation across this crucial developmental stage.  Ultimately, a multi-faceted approach, combining therapeutic interventions with supportive social environments, is essential for building resilient and healthy young adults.
