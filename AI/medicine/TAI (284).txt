Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and multifaceted area demanding ongoing scrutiny. This review examines key ethical challenges, including the allocation of scarce organs, the definition of death, and the potential for coercion and exploitation in organ procurement.  The current prioritization systems, often based on medical urgency and likelihood of success, are debated for their potential inequities, raising concerns about social justice and access for marginalized populations.  The evolving understanding of brain death continues to spark ethical discussion, particularly concerning the potential for inaccurate diagnoses and the differing cultural perspectives on death.  Furthermore, the vulnerability of potential donors, including living donors and those in vulnerable socioeconomic circumstances, necessitates robust safeguards against undue influence and exploitation.  Concerns regarding informed consent, equitable access, and the prevention of a commodified approach to organs remain paramount.  This review highlights the urgent need for transparent and ethically sound policies guided by principles of justice, beneficence, and respect for persons to navigate the complex ethical landscape of organ transplantation.  Further research is crucial to address persistent challenges and ensure equitable access to life-saving transplantation procedures.
