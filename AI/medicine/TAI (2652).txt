Organ transplantation remains a life-saving intervention, yet its practice is fraught with complex ethical dilemmas.  This abstract highlights recent developments and enduring challenges in this field.  The persistent global shortage of organs necessitates ongoing scrutiny of allocation systems, with debates centering on the fairness of prioritizing patients based on factors such as medical urgency, adherence to treatment regimens, and lifestyle choices.  Recent advancements in xenotransplantation, utilizing animal organs for transplantation, raise novel ethical concerns regarding animal welfare, the potential for zoonotic disease transmission, and equitable access to this potentially transformative technology.  Furthermore, the evolving landscape of genetic engineering and CRISPR technology introduces possibilities for enhancing organ suitability and reducing immune rejection, but also necessitates careful consideration of germline modifications and potential unforeseen consequences.  The informed consent process, particularly for vulnerable populations, continues to be a critical ethical cornerstone, requiring nuanced approaches to ensure autonomy and capacity are respected.  Finally, equitable access to transplantation services, transcending socioeconomic and geographical barriers, remains a paramount ethical imperative demanding policy interventions and resource allocation strategies focused on global health equity.
