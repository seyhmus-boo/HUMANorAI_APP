Cancer, a complex group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, has plagued humanity for millennia.  Early understandings, primarily observational, linked environmental factors to disease manifestation. However, the advent of molecular biology revolutionized our comprehension of cancer's etiology, revealing its inherent genetic basis.  Landmark discoveries, such as the identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, provided crucial insights into the molecular mechanisms driving carcinogenesis.  This understanding shifted the paradigm from solely focusing on broad-spectrum treatments to the burgeoning field of personalized medicine.  This paper explores the significant advances in our knowledge of cancer genetics that underpin the development of personalized cancer therapies. We will review the key genetic alterations implicated in various cancer types, focusing on mutations affecting oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair pathways.  Furthermore, we will examine the implications of these genetic findings for the development of targeted therapies, including small molecule inhibitors, immunotherapy, and gene therapies, and discuss the ongoing challenges and future directions of personalized cancer medicine, considering issues of accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and ethical implications.
