Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare diagnostics, impacting various medical disciplines.  Its influence spans from radiology, where AI algorithms excel at identifying subtle anomalies in medical images, to pathology, facilitating faster and more accurate analysis of tissue samples.  This review highlights the significant interdisciplinary collaborations driving this transformation.  Computer scientists develop and refine AI algorithms, working closely with clinicians (radiologists, pathologists, oncologists, etc.) to ensure clinical validity and usability.  Biostatisticians play a crucial role in validating diagnostic accuracy and managing biases inherent in datasets.  Furthermore, ethicists and legal experts contribute to address critical issues surrounding data privacy, algorithmic bias, and liability.  While AI offers remarkable potential for improved diagnostic accuracy, speed, and efficiency, successful implementation requires robust interdisciplinary collaborations to overcome challenges related to data integration, algorithm validation, and ethical considerations. Future research should focus on fostering stronger collaborative partnerships to ensure responsible and beneficial AI integration within the diagnostic landscape.  The success of AI in healthcare diagnostics ultimately hinges on this interdisciplinary synergy.
