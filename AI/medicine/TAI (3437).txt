Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset and development of mental health disorders.  Historically, understanding of adolescent mental health lagged behind adult psychiatry, often conflating childhood disorders with adult presentations and neglecting the unique developmental context. Early perspectives, largely shaped by psychoanalytic theories, focused on familial dynamics and internal conflicts.  However, the latter half of the 20th century witnessed a burgeoning of research employing epidemiological and neurobiological approaches, leading to a more nuanced understanding of the prevalence and etiology of adolescent mental health conditions.  This shift revealed striking increases in the rates of anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders, prompting significant concern and necessitating the development of tailored interventions. This paper will explore the evolving trends in the prevalence and presentation of key mental health disorders affecting adolescents, examining the influence of societal factors and technological advancements.  Furthermore, it will critically analyze the efficacy and limitations of current treatment modalities, including pharmacological, psychotherapeutic, and preventative approaches, advocating for a comprehensive and integrated strategy to address this growing public health challenge.
