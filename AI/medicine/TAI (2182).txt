Climate change significantly impacts public health through multifaceted pathways.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly affecting vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, expanding their geographical range and incidence.  Extreme weather events, increasingly frequent and intense due to climate change, lead to injuries, displacement, and mental health consequences, such as post-traumatic stress disorder.  Furthermore, alterations in air quality, driven by increased wildfires and pollution, exacerbate respiratory illnesses.

Recent developments highlight the growing urgency of this interconnectedness.  Studies increasingly demonstrate non-linear relationships, showing disproportionate health impacts even with modest temperature increases.  Advances in spatial epidemiology and modelling are improving predictions of disease outbreaks and heat-related morbidity under various climate scenarios.  However, research also reveals significant knowledge gaps, particularly concerning the complex interplay of climate change with existing health inequalities and the long-term consequences of chronic exposure to climate-related stressors.  Addressing this necessitates integrated research, robust surveillance systems, and proactive public health interventions that mitigate climate change and its health consequences simultaneously.
