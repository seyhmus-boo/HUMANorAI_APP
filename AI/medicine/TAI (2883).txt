Climate change, driven primarily by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, presents a profound and multifaceted threat to global public health.  While historically understood primarily through the lens of environmental degradation, its implications for human wellbeing are increasingly recognized as a critical area of research.  Early understandings focused on the direct impacts of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, leading to injuries, fatalities, and the displacement of populations. However, the scope of climate change's influence on health extends far beyond these immediate effects.  The 20th century witnessed a gradual increase in scientific awareness of the interconnectedness between environmental shifts and disease patterns, with studies linking altered precipitation patterns to vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever.  More recently, research has highlighted the intricate and often indirect pathways through which climate change impacts health, including air pollution exacerbation, food insecurity, mental health consequences of displacement and trauma, and the emergence of novel infectious diseases.  This paper explores the complex and evolving relationship between climate change and public health, examining both the established and emerging threats, and considering the implications for future research and intervention strategies.
