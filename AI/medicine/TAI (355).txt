Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting rising prevalence rates globally.  Anxiety and depression are particularly prevalent, often comorbid and influenced by a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and sociocultural factors.  Trends indicate increasing diagnoses, potentially reflecting improved awareness and diagnostic tools, but also highlighting the escalating pressures faced by young people in contemporary society, including academic stress, social media influence, and societal inequalities.  Treatment approaches are multifaceted, encompassing pharmacological interventions like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) for depression, and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) which addresses maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors.  Family-based therapies prove effective in addressing familial dynamics influencing the adolescent's mental health.  Practical applications emphasize early intervention strategies, promoting mental health literacy in schools and communities, and facilitating access to evidence-based treatments through increased funding and reduced stigma.  Integrating technology, such as telehealth platforms, expands accessibility, particularly in underserved areas.  Future research should focus on personalized medicine approaches, tailoring treatments to individual needs and incorporating longitudinal studies to better understand the long-term impact of adolescent mental health disorders.
