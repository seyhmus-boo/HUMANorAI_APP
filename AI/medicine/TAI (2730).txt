Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), initially pioneered with laparoscopy, has undergone a dramatic evolution, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and robotic technology.  Early laparoscopic procedures were largely limited by the two-dimensional view offered by the camera and the dexterity challenges imposed by the instruments.  However, significant progress has been made.  The development of high-definition 3D laparoscopy and robotic surgery systems, such as the da Vinci Surgical System, has markedly improved precision, dexterity, and surgeon ergonomics, enabling more complex procedures to be performed minimally invasively.  Recent developments include the integration of augmented reality and artificial intelligence (AI) into MIS.  Augmented reality overlays real-time anatomical data onto the surgical field, enhancing visualization and situational awareness.  AI algorithms are increasingly used for pre-operative planning, intraoperative assistance (e.g., real-time tissue identification), and post-operative prediction of complications, further refining the precision and safety of these techniques.  Furthermore, advancements in energy sources, such as ultrasound and radiofrequency ablation, alongside novel sutureless techniques, continue to reduce surgical trauma and improve patient outcomes.  This ongoing evolution promises to expand the applicability of MIS to an even wider range of surgical specialties.
