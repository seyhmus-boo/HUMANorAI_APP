Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, undermining the efficacy of treatments for bacterial infections.  Driven by factors including widespread antibiotic use in human and animal healthcare, agriculture, and inadequate infection control practices, AR results in increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs globally.  The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens, particularly Gram-negative bacteria and *Enterobacteriaceae*, presents a critical challenge to public health infrastructure, impacting the management of common infections and jeopardizing the success of complex surgical procedures.  The global implications extend beyond healthcare, impacting economic productivity through increased healthcare expenditure, lost workdays, and reduced agricultural yields.  Effective mitigation strategies require a multi-pronged approach encompassing stewardship programs to optimize antibiotic use, investment in novel antimicrobial drug discovery and development, strengthened surveillance systems to track resistance patterns, and improved hygiene and sanitation practices.  Addressing AR demands international collaboration and coordinated efforts to ensure the continued effectiveness of antibiotics and prevent a return to the pre-antibiotic era of high mortality from infectious diseases.
