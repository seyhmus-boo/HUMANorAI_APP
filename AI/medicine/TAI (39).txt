Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health globally. This presentation explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and human health outcomes, focusing on key pathways of impact.  We will examine the direct effects of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, on morbidity and mortality, highlighting vulnerable populations disproportionately affected.  Further, the indirect consequences of climate change, including changes in vector-borne disease transmission, air pollution exacerbation, and food and water insecurity, will be discussed.  The presentation will analyze the growing body of evidence demonstrating the escalating burden of climate-sensitive diseases and the associated economic and social costs.  Finally, we will briefly discuss strategies for effective adaptation and mitigation, emphasizing the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration between climate scientists, public health professionals, and policymakers in developing and implementing resilient health systems capable of mitigating the escalating health impacts of a changing climate.  This necessitates a proactive approach focused on both immediate response to acute events and long-term planning for a climate-resilient future.
