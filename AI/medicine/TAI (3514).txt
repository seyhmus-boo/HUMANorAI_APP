This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the genetic basis of cancer and their translation into personalized medicine.  Significant progress has been made in identifying driver mutations across diverse cancer types through high-throughput sequencing technologies.  This has led to the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, demonstrating improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to traditional chemotherapies in specific patient subgroups.  However, intratumoral heterogeneity and the emergence of resistance remain significant challenges.  Advances in liquid biopsies, enabling non-invasive monitoring of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), offer opportunities for early cancer detection, real-time disease monitoring, and the identification of resistance mechanisms.  Furthermore, the integration of genomic data with clinical and lifestyle factors through bioinformatics and machine learning algorithms is paving the way for more precise risk stratification and treatment selection. While personalized medicine based on cancer genomics holds immense promise, further research is needed to address challenges related to cost-effectiveness, access, and the ethical implications of genomic data usage.  Future directions include the development of more comprehensive genomic profiling assays and the integration of multi-omics data to refine therapeutic strategies and improve patient outcomes.
