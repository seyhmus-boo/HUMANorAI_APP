Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, driven by continuous advancements in instrumentation, imaging, and surgical techniques.  Early MIS procedures, primarily laparoscopic, relied on rigid instrumentation and 2D visualization, limiting dexterity and precision.  This abstract traces the evolution of MIS techniques, highlighting key advancements.  The introduction of robotic surgery significantly enhanced dexterity and precision through articulated instruments and 3D vision, expanding the applicability of MIS to complex procedures previously relegated to open surgery.  Simultaneously, advancements in energy sources (e.g., ultrasonic, bipolar) improved hemostasis and tissue dissection.  Natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) emerged as a paradigm shift, aiming for scarless surgery via natural orifices, although its widespread adoption remains limited due to technological and anatomical challenges.  Recent trends focus on enhanced visualization techniques, including augmented reality and fluorescence imaging, alongside the development of single-port and sutureless techniques.  Further research is needed to address remaining challenges, such as the learning curve associated with new technologies and the optimization of surgical workflows for improved efficiency and patient outcomes.  Ultimately, the evolution of MIS techniques continues to drive improved patient safety, reduced morbidity, and faster recovery times.
