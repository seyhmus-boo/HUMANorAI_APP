The genetic basis of cancer underpins the burgeoning field of personalized medicine.  Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of oncogenesis, revealing the complex interplay of somatic mutations, germline predispositions, and epigenetic modifications driving tumorigenesis.  This detailed genomic characterization allows for the identification of specific driver mutations, paving the way for targeted therapies tailored to individual patient profiles.  For instance, the presence of *EGFR* mutations in lung adenocarcinoma dictates the efficacy of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors.  Furthermore,  analysis of tumor mutational burden (TMB) informs treatment decisions regarding immunotherapy, particularly checkpoint inhibitors.  Ongoing challenges include the heterogeneity within tumors, the emergence of drug resistance driven by further mutations, and the cost-effectiveness of comprehensive genomic profiling.  Nevertheless, the integration of genomic data with clinical information promises a future where cancer treatment is increasingly precise, effective, and individualized, improving patient outcomes and reducing adverse effects.
