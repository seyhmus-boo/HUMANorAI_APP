Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has undergone a period of rapid evolution, significantly impacting modern healthcare delivery.  Recent developments are characterized by an increasing sophistication in technological capabilities and a broadening of its applications.  High-speed internet access and the proliferation of mobile devices have facilitated wider adoption of telehealth platforms, enabling remote patient monitoring (RPM) of vital signs and chronic conditions, such as diabetes and heart failure.  Furthermore, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) are powering diagnostic tools capable of analyzing medical images remotely, assisting clinicians in faster and more accurate diagnosis.  The integration of wearable sensors provides continuous data streams, offering personalized interventions and proactive management of patient health.  However, challenges persist, including issues of digital literacy among patients, ensuring data security and privacy, and overcoming regulatory hurdles related to licensing and reimbursement across geographical boundaries. Despite these obstacles, telemedicine's expanding role in addressing healthcare access disparities, particularly in rural and underserved populations, positions it as a cornerstone of future healthcare systems, demanding further research into its efficacy and ethical implications.
