Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are deeply rooted in its historical context. Early transplants, often involving close relatives, raised fewer ethical dilemmas compared to the current system relying heavily on deceased donation.  The shift towards deceased donation introduced complex issues regarding consent, particularly around presumed consent versus explicit consent models.  Different jurisdictions grapple with defining death itself, impacting the timing and legality of organ retrieval.

Equitable access to transplantation remains a significant challenge, raising concerns about distributive justice.  Wealthy individuals often enjoy privileged access, while those in lower socioeconomic brackets face extended waitlists, highlighting systemic inequalities.  Furthermore, the potential for coercion, particularly in vulnerable populations, necessitates robust safeguards against exploitative practices.  Finally, the debate surrounding living donation involves balancing altruism with the potential risks to the donor's health and well-being, demanding careful assessment of autonomy and informed consent.  These multifaceted issues require ongoing ethical reflection and robust regulatory frameworks.
