Climate change significantly impacts public health through a complex interplay of environmental and societal factors.  Rising temperatures exacerbate heat-related illnesses and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to increased flooding and waterborne disease outbreaks, while altered vector distributions expand the geographical range of infectious diseases like malaria and dengue fever.  Furthermore, extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, cause direct injuries and fatalities, disrupt healthcare infrastructure, and negatively impact mental health through displacement and trauma.  Indirect effects include malnutrition due to crop failures and reduced air quality exacerbating respiratory illnesses.  Addressing climate change, therefore, is crucial for safeguarding public health. Mitigation strategies focusing on greenhouse gas emission reductions and adaptation measures aimed at building climate resilience in healthcare systems and communities are essential for minimizing the substantial public health burden of a changing climate.  Further research is needed to fully quantify the complex and evolving relationship between these two critical global challenges.
