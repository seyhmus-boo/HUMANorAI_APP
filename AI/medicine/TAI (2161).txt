Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating threat to global health security, demanding an urgent and multifaceted response. This research paper explores the complex and interconnected challenges presented by AR, highlighting the crucial need for interdisciplinary collaboration to effectively mitigate its impact.  The emergence and dissemination of resistant pathogens transcends geographical boundaries, impacting healthcare systems, economies, and social structures worldwide.  Understanding AR necessitates a synthesis of knowledge from diverse fields.  This study draws upon insights from microbiology, epidemiology, medicine, public health, veterinary science, environmental science, and the social sciences to comprehensively examine the drivers of AR.  We explore the role of agricultural practices, human behavior, healthcare infrastructure, and environmental contamination in fostering resistance.  Furthermore, we analyze the implications of AR on global health equity, considering disparities in access to effective antimicrobial treatments and the disproportionate burden borne by vulnerable populations.  Finally, we examine the potential of interdisciplinary approaches, such as One Health initiatives and the development of innovative diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, to combat this growing crisis.
