Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting escalating prevalence rates globally.  Trends indicate a rise in anxiety and depression, alongside increasing diagnoses of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and eating disorders.  These increases are likely multifactorial, influenced by societal pressures, technological advancements, and evolving understanding of diagnostic criteria.  Effective treatment necessitates an interdisciplinary approach.  Psychiatry provides pharmacological interventions, tailoring medication to individual needs and considering potential interactions with other therapies.  Psychology offers evidence-based psychotherapies, including Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), targeting maladaptive thought patterns and emotional regulation.  Crucially, social work plays a vital role in addressing systemic factors impacting mental wellbeing, facilitating access to resources and supporting family engagement.  Furthermore, educational psychologists contribute by identifying and addressing learning difficulties which may exacerbate mental health challenges, promoting inclusive school environments.  Successful interventions often integrate these disciplines, acknowledging the biopsychosocial model and the interconnectedness of individual, familial, and societal influences on adolescent mental health.  Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies to better understand developmental trajectories and refine integrated treatment strategies.
