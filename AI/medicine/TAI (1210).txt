Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding urgent attention.  Research into AR faces considerable experimental challenges, hindering the development of effective countermeasures.  One major hurdle is the inherent complexity of bacterial systems, exhibiting diverse mechanisms of resistance and often involving intricate interplay between bacterial genes and the host environment.  Reproducing these complexities in vitro presents significant difficulty, often leading to discrepancies between in vitro findings and clinical realities.  Furthermore, developing robust high-throughput screening assays for novel antibiotics is hampered by the lack of standardized methods and the diversity of bacterial species involved.  The evaluation of antibiotic efficacy is further complicated by the heterogeneous nature of bacterial populations within infections, with subpopulations exhibiting differing levels of resistance, leading to treatment failure.  Finally, the long timelines and high costs associated with the development and regulatory approval of new antibiotics constitute a significant barrier to innovation.  Overcoming these experimental challenges necessitates a multi-faceted approach encompassing advanced modelling techniques, improved screening methods, and greater investment in research and development.
