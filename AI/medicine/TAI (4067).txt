This presentation examines the pivotal role of nutrition in preventing chronic diseases, tracing its evolution from historical understandings to contemporary scientific evidence. Historically, nutritional deficiency diseases like scurvy and beriberi highlighted the crucial link between diet and health, shaping early public health interventions. However, the understanding of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers, as significantly influenced by dietary factors evolved more gradually.  This presentation will review the epidemiological evidence supporting the association between specific dietary patterns – including the Mediterranean diet and DASH diet – and reduced risk of these chronic conditions.  We will discuss the mechanisms by which nutritional factors, such as macronutrient balance, micronutrient intake, and phytochemical consumption, exert their protective effects, encompassing inflammation, oxidative stress, and gut microbiome modulation.  Finally, the presentation will address the challenges in translating this knowledge into effective public health strategies, considering factors such as socioeconomic disparities and the complex interplay of genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors influencing dietary choices and chronic disease development.  We conclude by emphasizing the urgent need for integrated, multi-faceted approaches to promote healthy diets and prevent chronic disease burdens globally.
