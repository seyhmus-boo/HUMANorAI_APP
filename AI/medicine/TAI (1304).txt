Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's ability to treat bacterial infections.  The widespread use and misuse of antibiotics have driven the selection and proliferation of resistant strains, rendering previously effective treatments ineffective.  This phenomenon transcends geographical boundaries, impacting healthcare systems worldwide and exacerbating morbidity and mortality rates.  Recent developments highlight the escalating severity of the problem.  The emergence of resistance to last-resort antibiotics, such as carbapenems and colistin, represents a particularly alarming trend.  Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, capable of resisting multiple classes of antibiotics, necessitates a paradigm shift in infectious disease management.  This includes a concerted global effort to curtail antibiotic overuse, enhance surveillance mechanisms for tracking resistance patterns, and accelerate the development of novel antibiotics and alternative therapeutic strategies, such as phage therapy and immunotherapy.  Failure to address AR effectively will profoundly impact healthcare accessibility, economic productivity, and global health security.
