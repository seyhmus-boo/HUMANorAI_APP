Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, jeopardizing the efficacy of treatments for bacterial infections.  While the clinical implications are widely acknowledged, translating epidemiological observations into effective interventions faces substantial experimental challenges.  The complex interplay of bacterial genetics, selective pressures exerted by antibiotic usage, and the ecological dynamics within microbial communities hinders the development of robust predictive models.  Laboratory experiments struggle to accurately replicate the in vivo complexities of host-pathogen interactions and the diverse selective pressures encountered in natural environments.  Moreover,  studying the evolution and spread of resistance in clinically relevant bacterial populations requires ethically-challenging longitudinal studies with stringent infection control measures.  Furthermore, the development of novel antibiotics is hampered by a dwindling pipeline, coupled with the high cost and time investment required for research and development.  Addressing the global challenge of AR necessitates overcoming these experimental hurdles through the development of innovative high-throughput screening methods, advanced in silico modelling incorporating ecological complexity, and improved collaborative research initiatives promoting the responsible use of existing antibiotics and facilitating the discovery of novel antimicrobial agents.
