Mental health disorders in adolescents are a growing concern globally, impacting academic performance, social functioning, and long-term well-being. This presentation will examine recent trends in the prevalence and presentation of common adolescent mental health disorders, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  We will analyze data highlighting shifts in diagnostic rates, potential contributing factors such as increased social media use and academic pressures, and disparities in access to care based on socio-economic status and ethnicity.  Further, the presentation will explore contemporary treatment approaches, encompassing evidence-based interventions such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), and family-based therapies.  A critical evaluation of the efficacy and limitations of these treatments will be provided, alongside a discussion of emerging therapeutic modalities such as mindfulness-based interventions and digital mental health platforms.  Finally, the presentation will emphasize the crucial role of early identification, timely intervention, and integrated care models in improving outcomes for adolescents struggling with mental health challenges.  The aim is to facilitate a better understanding of current trends and promote informed discussion on effective strategies for improving adolescent mental health.
