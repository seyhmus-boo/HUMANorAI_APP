Adolescents experience a significant burden of mental health disorders, with increasing prevalence rates observed globally. This presentation will examine recent trends in the epidemiology of common adolescent mental health conditions, including anxiety disorders, depression, and substance use disorders. We will explore contributing factors such as societal pressures, technological advancements, and biological vulnerabilities.  Particular attention will be paid to the evolving understanding of the interplay between these factors and their influence on disorder onset, course, and severity.  The presentation will then review current best-practice treatments, focusing on evidence-based interventions such as cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), and psychopharmacological approaches.  A critical appraisal of the limitations of current treatment modalities, including access disparities and treatment adherence challenges, will be offered.  Finally, promising avenues for future research, such as personalized medicine and the development of novel digital interventions, will be discussed.  This presentation aims to provide clinicians and researchers with an updated overview of the landscape of adolescent mental health, highlighting areas requiring further investigation and innovation to improve outcomes for this vulnerable population.
