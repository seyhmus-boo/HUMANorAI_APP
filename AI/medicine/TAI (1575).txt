Adolescents experience a disproportionately high prevalence of mental health disorders, with significant trends observed across recent years.  Increases in anxiety and depression diagnoses are particularly noteworthy, potentially linked to societal factors such as increased academic pressure, social media usage, and exposure to traumatic events.  Furthermore, the comorbidity of multiple disorders, such as anxiety and substance use, is increasingly prevalent, complicating treatment and prognosis.  Treatment approaches vary widely depending on the specific disorder and its severity, ranging from evidence-based psychotherapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to pharmacological interventions, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants.  Integrated approaches, combining therapy and medication, are often considered the most effective for moderate to severe cases.  However, access to appropriate and timely mental healthcare remains a significant barrier for many adolescents, particularly those from disadvantaged socioeconomic backgrounds. Future research should focus on identifying preventative strategies, improving early intervention programs, and addressing systemic inequalities in access to care to mitigate the growing burden of adolescent mental health disorders.
