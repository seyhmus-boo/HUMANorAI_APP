Mental health disorders in adolescents represent a significant public health concern, exhibiting increasing prevalence over recent decades. Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with limited diagnostic frameworks and treatment options.  Early conceptualizations focused on societal maladjustment rather than underlying biological or psychological factors. However, advancements in neurobiological understanding, alongside epidemiological research employing standardized diagnostic tools like the DSM-5 and ICD-11, have revealed a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and social influences impacting conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders.  These studies consistently demonstrate rising rates, particularly among girls.  Current treatment strategies incorporate a multidisciplinary approach, emphasizing evidence-based therapies like cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), alongside pharmacological interventions where appropriate.  However, significant disparities persist in access to care, particularly for marginalized youth.  Future research should focus on early intervention strategies, personalized treatment approaches informed by precision medicine, and reducing stigma to improve mental health outcomes for adolescents globally.  Addressing the systemic issues contributing to these disorders is crucial for effective long-term solutions.
