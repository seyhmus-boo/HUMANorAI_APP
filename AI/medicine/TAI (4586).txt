This presentation explores the crucial role of nutrition in preventing chronic diseases, highlighting the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration for effective interventions.  Chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain cancers, share significant nutritional risk factors.  However, addressing these complex issues requires a multi-faceted approach that transcends the boundaries of traditional disciplines.  This presentation will examine the interplay between nutritional science, public health, behavioral science, and economics in shaping dietary choices and health outcomes.  We will discuss the limitations of solely focusing on nutritional guidelines, emphasizing the importance of understanding socio-economic determinants of food access and affordability, psychological factors influencing dietary behavior, and the impact of food policy and marketing strategies.  Further, the presentation will explore the potential of interdisciplinary collaborations to develop and implement effective population-level interventions, such as community-based nutrition programs and policy changes that promote healthy food environments.  Ultimately, we argue that a holistic, interdisciplinary approach is vital for translating nutritional science into effective chronic disease prevention strategies.
