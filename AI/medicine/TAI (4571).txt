Organ transplantation represents a remarkable advancement in medical science, offering life-saving interventions for individuals with end-stage organ failure.  However, the inherent scarcity of transplantable organs necessitates a complex system of allocation and procurement, raising significant ethical challenges. This paper examines the multifaceted ethical considerations surrounding organ transplantation, focusing on three key areas: equitable allocation of scarce resources, the ethical implications of live organ donation, and the potential for exploitation and coercion within the procurement process.  We analyze existing ethical frameworks and guidelines, exploring the tension between maximizing the number of successful transplants and ensuring fairness and justice in the allocation process.  Furthermore, we scrutinize the informed consent process for both deceased and living donors, highlighting the vulnerability of potential donors and the need for rigorous safeguards against undue influence.  Finally, we discuss the global disparities in access to transplantation and the ethical responsibilities of the international community in addressing these inequalities. This research contributes to a critical evaluation of current practices and proposes avenues for enhancing ethical decision-making in the field of organ transplantation.
