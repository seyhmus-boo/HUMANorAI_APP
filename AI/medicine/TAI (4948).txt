Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, extending beyond the traditionally recognized impacts of extreme weather events.  Recent research underscores the increasingly complex and interconnected nature of this relationship, demanding a more nuanced understanding than previously held.  This paper examines the evolving connections between climate change and public health outcomes, focusing on recent developments in the field.  We move beyond the well-established links between heat waves and mortality to explore emerging challenges, such as the expansion of vector-borne diseases due to shifting climatic zones and the exacerbation of air pollution through increased wildfire frequency and intensity.  Furthermore, we address the indirect consequences, including mental health impacts stemming from climate-related disasters and displacement, and the amplified burden on healthcare systems struggling to cope with climate-sensitive diseases.  This review synthesizes recent epidemiological studies, modelling projections, and policy interventions to illustrate the urgent need for comprehensive, integrated strategies addressing both climate mitigation and adaptation to protect public health in the face of a rapidly changing climate.  The paper concludes by highlighting critical knowledge gaps and recommending future research directions.
