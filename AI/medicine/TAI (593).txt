Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgery, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This evolution, however, has been inextricably linked to significant experimental challenges in refining both instrumentation and surgical approaches.  This paper explores the key experimental hurdles encountered throughout the development of MIS procedures, from early laparoscopic techniques to the current era of robotic surgery and advanced imaging modalities.  Challenges in translating bench-top innovations to the operating room, including issues of dexterity, precision, and haptic feedback in confined spaces, will be critically analyzed.  We will examine the limitations of existing experimental models in accurately simulating the complex biomechanical properties of human tissues and the difficulties in objectively assessing the effectiveness of new surgical instruments and techniques. Furthermore, the ethical considerations surrounding the translation of experimental advancements into clinical practice, particularly concerning patient safety and the need for rigorous validation, will be discussed. Ultimately, this review aims to highlight the ongoing experimental work required to further refine and advance the field of minimally invasive surgery.
