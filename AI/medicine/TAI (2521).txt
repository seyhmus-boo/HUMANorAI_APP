Antibiotic resistance (AR) presents a significant and escalating global health threat, jeopardizing modern medicine's capacity to treat bacterial infections.  This review summarizes the multifaceted nature of AR and its widespread implications.  The primary driver is the overuse and misuse of antibiotics, fostering the selection and proliferation of resistant strains across diverse bacterial species.  Consequences range from increased morbidity and mortality associated with treatment failure to substantial economic burdens on healthcare systems worldwide.  The global spread of resistant pathogens, facilitated by international travel and trade, exacerbates the challenge.

Practical applications focusing on mitigation strategies are crucial.  These include optimizing antibiotic prescribing practices through stewardship programs, promoting infection prevention and control measures in healthcare settings, and developing rapid diagnostic tools to guide targeted therapy.  Furthermore, research and development of novel antibiotics and alternative therapeutic approaches, such as bacteriophage therapy and antimicrobial peptides, are urgently needed.  Strengthening global surveillance systems to track resistance patterns and implementing effective public health interventions are equally vital to curbing this global crisis.  Ultimately, a multi-pronged, collaborative approach encompassing individual responsibility, healthcare system improvements, and global cooperation is essential to address the growing menace of antibiotic resistance.
