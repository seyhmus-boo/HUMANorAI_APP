This review summarizes recent advances in understanding the genetic basis of cancer and their translation into personalized medicine.  Significant progress has been made in identifying driver mutations and oncogenic pathways through high-throughput sequencing technologies, enabling more precise cancer classification and prognosis. This improved understanding has spurred the development of targeted therapies, such as kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which show enhanced efficacy compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapies.  However, challenges remain, including the identification of actionable mutations in a subset of cancers, the emergence of drug resistance driven by further genetic alterations, and the need for cost-effective and accessible genomic testing.  Furthermore, the complexity of tumor heterogeneity and the interplay between genetic and epigenetic factors necessitate a more holistic approach. While personalized medicine offers a promising paradigm shift in cancer treatment, continued research focusing on comprehensive genomic profiling, development of novel therapeutic strategies to circumvent resistance mechanisms, and equitable access to these advancements are crucial for maximizing its benefits.
