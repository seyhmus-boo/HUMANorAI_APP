Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma and faster recovery.  This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in the evolution of MIS techniques, focusing on the interplay between technological advancements and surgical skill acquisition.  Early MIS relied on rudimentary instrumentation and limited visualization, posing significant challenges in dexterity and precision.  The subsequent development of robotic surgery and enhanced imaging modalities, while improving accuracy, introduced new complexities.  Experimental work is crucial in addressing these challenges, ranging from the development and validation of novel instruments and robotic systems to the creation of realistic simulation models for surgical training.  We will discuss the limitations of current simulation platforms in replicating the tactile feedback and dynamic tissue response encountered during actual procedures.  Furthermore, we will examine the difficulties in standardizing preclinical evaluations across different MIS techniques and assessing long-term outcomes.  Overcoming these experimental hurdles is vital for advancing the safety and efficacy of MIS and ensuring consistent high-quality patient care.  The presentation concludes by highlighting promising avenues for future research, including the integration of artificial intelligence and advanced materials science in MIS technology.
