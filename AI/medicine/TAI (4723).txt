Telemedicine, the remote delivery of healthcare services using information and communication technologies, has evolved significantly from its rudimentary beginnings in the 1960s, initially employing basic technologies like telephone consultations.  Its modern iteration leverages advanced tools such as video conferencing, remote patient monitoring (RPM) devices, and electronic health records (EHRs) to expand access and improve the efficiency of healthcare delivery.

Historically hampered by technological limitations and regulatory hurdles, telemedicine has experienced exponential growth, particularly accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  It now plays a crucial role in addressing various healthcare challenges, including geographical limitations to specialist access, overcoming resource constraints in underserved communities, and facilitating chronic disease management through RPM.  Furthermore, telemedicine offers enhanced patient convenience, reduced healthcare costs through decreased travel and hospital admissions, and improved continuity of care.  However, challenges persist, including digital literacy disparities amongst patients, concerns about data security and privacy, and the need for standardized regulations and reimbursement models to ensure widespread adoption and equitable access.
