Minimally invasive surgical techniques have revolutionized healthcare, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes compared to traditional open surgery.  This paper explores the evolution of these techniques, highlighting the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in driving advancements.  From the initial laparoscopic approaches, characterized by limited dexterity and visualization challenges, the field has witnessed exponential growth fueled by contributions from diverse scientific disciplines.  Mechanical engineering has provided innovative instrumentation, including robotic systems offering enhanced precision and control, while materials science has contributed biocompatible and durable implants.  Advances in imaging technologies, such as high-definition endoscopes and 3D visualization, developed through collaborations between medicine and physics, have significantly improved surgical accuracy and safety.  Furthermore, the integration of computer science, through the development of surgical simulation and augmented reality platforms, facilitates training and enhances surgical planning.  This research will analyze the interplay between these disciplines, examining how their combined expertise has shaped the trajectory of minimally invasive surgery and continues to pave the way for future innovations, focusing specifically on the impact of interdisciplinary research on procedural safety, efficacy, and patient outcomes.
