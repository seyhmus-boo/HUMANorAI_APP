Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of bacteria to withstand antibiotic treatment, poses a significant and growing threat to global health.  Driven by factors including overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, as well as agricultural practices, AR leads to treatment failures, prolonged illness, increased mortality, and substantial healthcare costs.  The global implications are profound, impacting healthcare systems' capacity to manage infectious diseases and threatening progress in various fields, including surgery, organ transplantation, and cancer treatment.  The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) bacteria, particularly in healthcare settings, necessitates urgent action.  Practical applications for mitigating AR include improved infection control measures, optimizing antibiotic prescribing practices through stewardship programs, developing rapid diagnostic tests to guide treatment, and accelerating the discovery and development of novel antibiotics and alternative therapeutic strategies, such as bacteriophages and immunotherapy.  Furthermore, stringent regulations governing antibiotic use in agriculture and promoting public health education campaigns are crucial to curb the spread of AR and safeguard global health security.  International collaboration is vital to address this complex challenge effectively.
