Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, demanding innovative solutions beyond traditional approaches. This presentation explores the potential of quantum mechanics to address this crisis, moving beyond empirical observations to a deeper understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms.  We will discuss how quantum chemical calculations, such as density functional theory (DFT), can be employed to investigate the binding affinities of antibiotics to their target proteins in resistant and susceptible strains. This allows for the identification of crucial structural features influencing binding strength and the prediction of mutations driving resistance.  Furthermore, we will explore the application of quantum simulations to design novel antibiotics with improved efficacy and reduced susceptibility to resistance mechanisms.  This involves exploring the potential energy landscapes of antibiotic-target interactions to identify optimal binding conformations and to design molecules that evade resistance pathways. By leveraging the power of quantum mechanics, we can accelerate the discovery and development of new antibiotics and strategies for combating the global spread of AR, ultimately contributing to a more effective and sustainable approach to antimicrobial therapy.  This presentation will highlight current progress and future directions in this rapidly evolving field.
