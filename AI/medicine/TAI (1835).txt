Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding urgent attention. While the clinical implications are widely acknowledged, experimental challenges hinder effective research and mitigation strategies.  One key hurdle lies in the difficulty of accurately modelling the complex interplay of factors driving AR development, including bacterial evolution, environmental pressures, and human behaviour.  In vitro studies often fail to capture the intricacies of in vivo environments, leading to discrepancies between laboratory findings and real-world observations.  Furthermore, the development of robust high-throughput screening methods for novel antibiotics faces significant limitations, exacerbated by the inherent chemical complexity of bacterial targets.  Establishing standardized methodologies for measuring and comparing AR levels across diverse settings remains a critical challenge, hindering comparative analyses and the identification of effective interventions.  Finally, the ethical considerations surrounding clinical trials for new antimicrobials in the face of potentially high treatment failure rates present a considerable obstacle.  Overcoming these experimental roadblocks requires a multidisciplinary approach, integrating advanced modelling techniques, innovative screening methodologies, and ethically sound clinical trial designs to ultimately combat the escalating global crisis of AR.
