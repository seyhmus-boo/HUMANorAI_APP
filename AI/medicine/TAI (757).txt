Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, jeopardizing the effectiveness of treatments for bacterial infections and impacting healthcare systems worldwide.  The rise of AR is driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and animal health, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices.  Recent developments highlight the complex interplay of environmental, societal, and genetic factors contributing to this crisis.  Whole-genome sequencing technologies are increasingly used to track the spread of resistant strains, revealing the global dissemination of highly resistant clones and the emergence of novel resistance mechanisms.  Furthermore, advancements in understanding the microbiome's role in AR are shedding light on potential therapeutic strategies, including phage therapy and microbiome modulation.  However, significant challenges remain in developing new antibiotics, implementing effective stewardship programs, and addressing the economic and social determinants of AR.  International collaborations and coordinated efforts are crucial to combat this escalating public health emergency, requiring a One Health approach encompassing human, animal, and environmental health to mitigate the global impact of antibiotic resistance.
