Adolescent mental health disorders represent a significant global public health concern, exhibiting rising prevalence rates across diverse settings. This abstract summarizes recent trends and treatment approaches for these conditions.  Anxiety disorders and depression remain the most prevalent, impacting academic performance, social functioning, and overall well-being.  Emerging data suggests an increasing burden of self-harm and suicidal ideation, demanding urgent attention to preventative strategies.  Treatment modalities continue to evolve, with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) remaining cornerstones of evidence-based care.  However, access to timely and appropriate care remains a major barrier, particularly in low-resource settings.  Future research should focus on developing culturally sensitive, cost-effective interventions, tailored to specific adolescent needs and delivered through accessible platforms.  Practical applications include integrating mental health screenings into routine adolescent healthcare, training educators to identify early warning signs, and promoting widespread dissemination of evidence-based psychoeducation.  Addressing these issues requires a multi-pronged approach involving healthcare professionals, educators, policymakers, and families to effectively mitigate the escalating impact of adolescent mental health disorders.
