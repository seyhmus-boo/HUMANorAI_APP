Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health globally.  Rising temperatures directly contribute to increased morbidity and mortality from heatstroke and cardiovascular events, particularly impacting vulnerable populations such as the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.  Furthermore, altered weather patterns exacerbate the spread of infectious diseases, with vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever expanding their geographical range and intensity.  Changes in precipitation patterns can lead to water scarcity, impacting sanitation and increasing the risk of waterborne diseases.  Extreme weather events, including floods, droughts, and wildfires, cause direct injuries and fatalities, displace populations, and disrupt essential health services, leading to secondary health impacts like malnutrition and mental health issues.  Indirect effects are equally concerning, with climate change potentially increasing food insecurity, air pollution, and the prevalence of respiratory illnesses.  Therefore, addressing climate change is not merely an environmental imperative but a crucial public health priority requiring integrated strategies that mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and bolster climate resilience within healthcare systems.  Future research should focus on quantifying the specific health burdens attributable to climate change and developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies tailored to diverse contexts.
