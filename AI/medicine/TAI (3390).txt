Climate change poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health. This presentation examines the multifaceted relationship between a changing climate and human well-being, highlighting recent developments in our understanding of this complex interplay.  We will explore direct impacts such as increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, amplified transmission of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever, and the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to worsening air quality.  

Recent research emphasizes the disproportionate burden of climate-related health impacts on vulnerable populations, including low-income communities and marginalized groups.  We will discuss the growing body of evidence demonstrating the link between climate change, food insecurity, and malnutrition, leading to increased susceptibility to infectious diseases and other health problems.  Furthermore, the presentation will touch upon the mental health consequences of climate-related disasters, displacement, and environmental degradation.  Finally, we will briefly address promising adaptation and mitigation strategies aimed at reducing climate-related health risks, emphasizing the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in building climate-resilient health systems and promoting equitable access to healthcare.
