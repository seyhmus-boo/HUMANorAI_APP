Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to mitigation.  The rise of resistant pathogens, driven by overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture, transcends purely medical concerns.  Economic implications are substantial, with increased healthcare costs, lost productivity, and potential disruptions to global food security.  Environmental science plays a crucial role, investigating the dissemination of resistant genes through wastewater and soil, highlighting the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health â€“ the "One Health" paradigm.  Social sciences contribute by analyzing antibiotic use patterns, influencing public health interventions through targeted educational campaigns and policy changes regarding antibiotic stewardship.  Furthermore, the development of novel antimicrobial therapies requires interdisciplinary collaborations between chemists, biologists, and engineers, exploring alternative strategies like phage therapy and immune-based therapies.  Effectively combating AR requires a coordinated, global effort integrating expertise across disciplines to address both immediate clinical challenges and the underlying socio-ecological drivers of resistance.
