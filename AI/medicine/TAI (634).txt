Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has revolutionized surgical practice, driven by advancements minimizing tissue trauma and improving patient outcomes.  Early MIS techniques, primarily laparoscopy, relied on 2D visualization and limited instrument dexterity.  However, recent decades have witnessed a paradigm shift towards enhanced visualization and instrument control.  The advent of robotic surgery, with its superior dexterity, 3D vision, and tremor filtration, has broadened the scope of MIS to complex procedures previously deemed unsuitable.  Simultaneously, natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES) has explored accessing surgical sites through natural orifices, minimizing external incisions.  Recent developments in NOTES include improved access techniques and specialized instrumentation.  Furthermore, advancements in imaging technology, such as fluorescence imaging and augmented reality overlays, provide surgeons with real-time, enhanced anatomical visualization.  These combined advancements contribute to decreased postoperative pain, shorter hospital stays, reduced scarring, and improved patient quality of life.  Ongoing research focuses on refining existing techniques, exploring new minimally invasive approaches, and developing sophisticated haptic feedback systems for enhanced surgical precision and control within the expanding field of MIS.
