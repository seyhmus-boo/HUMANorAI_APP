Adolescence, a period of significant biological, psychological, and social transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window of vulnerability for the onset and development of mental health disorders.  This paper examines recent trends in the prevalence and presentation of mental health disorders among adolescents, highlighting the escalating burden on healthcare systems globally.  While specific disorders such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders remain prevalent, emerging concerns include the rising rates of self-harm and eating disorders, demanding a comprehensive and nuanced understanding.  Crucially, this research emphasizes the critical need for interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing this complex issue.  Effective treatment necessitates the integration of perspectives and expertise from psychiatry, psychology, social work, neuroscience, and education, amongst others. This interdisciplinary approach is explored through an analysis of current treatment modalities, including pharmacological interventions, psychotherapies, and community-based support programs, examining their efficacy and identifying areas requiring further research and collaboration.  Ultimately, the paper advocates for a holistic, integrated model of care that leverages the strengths of multiple disciplines to improve early identification, intervention, and long-term outcomes for adolescents struggling with mental health challenges.
