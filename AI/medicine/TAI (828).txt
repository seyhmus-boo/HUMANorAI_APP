Adolescence, a period of significant physical, cognitive, and emotional transformation, is increasingly recognized as a critical window for the onset of mental health disorders.  Historically, adolescent mental health was often overlooked, with issues attributed to "teenage angst" or dismissed as transient phases.  However, growing epidemiological research reveals a concerning rise in the prevalence of conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders among young people.  This upward trend, documented across diverse geographical regions and socio-economic strata, demands urgent attention and necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the contributing factors and effective treatment strategies.  This paper explores the evolving landscape of adolescent mental health, tracing historical perspectives on diagnosis and treatment to contemporary understandings.  We will examine emerging trends in prevalence rates, analyze potential contributing factors including societal pressures, technological advancements, and biological vulnerabilities, and critically evaluate the efficacy of existing therapeutic interventions, including pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and integrated approaches.  Ultimately, this review aims to illuminate critical gaps in current knowledge and advocate for improved access to timely and appropriate care for adolescents experiencing mental health challenges.
