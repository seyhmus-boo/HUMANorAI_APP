Minimally invasive surgery (MIS), a paradigm shift in surgical practice, has undergone remarkable evolution since its nascent stages. Early attempts, dating back to the late 19th century with pioneering laparoscopic explorations, were hampered by limited instrumentation and visualization.  The introduction of the Hopkins rod lens system in the 1970s significantly improved image quality, paving the way for broader adoption.  However, early procedures were primarily diagnostic, with therapeutic applications remaining limited by dexterity challenges.

Subsequent decades witnessed exponential growth, driven by advancements in endoscopy, robotics, and imaging technologies.  The development of smaller, more versatile instruments and high-definition cameras enhanced precision and control.  Robotic surgery, emerging in the 1990s, further revolutionized MIS by offering enhanced dexterity and ergonomic advantages for surgeons.  Simultaneously, advancements in energy sources, such as lasers and ultrasonic shears, improved tissue dissection and hemostasis.

Contemporary MIS encompasses a broad spectrum of procedures, from simple laparoscopic appendectomies to complex robotic-assisted cardiac surgeries.  Further innovation is anticipated, particularly in areas like augmented reality, artificial intelligence, and single-port access techniques, promising continued improvements in patient outcomes and surgical efficacy.  Despite significant progress, challenges remain regarding training, cost-effectiveness, and the selection of appropriate candidates for MIS.
