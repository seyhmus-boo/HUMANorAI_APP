Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are typically framed within classical bioethical frameworks.  This presentation argues that a quantum mechanical perspective, specifically focusing on the concept of quantum entanglement and observer dependence, offers a novel and potentially enriching lens through which to examine these dilemmas.  Traditional bioethics emphasizes donor autonomy and recipient well-being as separate, classical entities. However, the entangled nature of biological systems, where the donor's state is inextricably linked to the recipient's post-transplantation, challenges this separation.  We posit that the act of transplantation itself constitutes a measurement, collapsing the superposition of donor and recipient states into a single, observed reality. This "measurement" raises questions regarding the persistence of donor identity and the potential for unintended consequences arising from the unavoidable entanglement disruption.  Further, the observer effect, where the act of observation alters the observed system, necessitates critical consideration of the ethical responsibilities of healthcare professionals involved in the procurement and allocation process.  Exploring these quantum analogies prompts a re-evaluation of existing ethical guidelines, potentially leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive approach to organ transplantation ethics. This presentation will outline these concepts and initiate discussion on the implications for future policy and practice.
