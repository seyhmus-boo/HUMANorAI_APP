The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare diagnostics represents a paradigm shift with potentially transformative consequences. While the application of computational tools in medicine dates back to early image analysis techniques in the mid-20th century, the recent advancements in machine learning, particularly deep learning, have propelled AI to the forefront of diagnostic innovation.  Early efforts primarily focused on rule-based expert systems, limited by their rigid structure and inability to handle the inherent complexity and variability of medical data.  However, the exponential growth of computing power and the availability of vast medical datasets have enabled the development of AI algorithms capable of identifying subtle patterns and correlations beyond human capacity. This research explores the multifaceted impact of AI on various diagnostic domains, from medical imaging analysis (radiology, pathology) to genomic sequencing and electrocardiogram interpretation. We will examine the benefits, including increased diagnostic accuracy, speed, and accessibility, alongside the limitations and challenges, such as algorithm bias, data privacy concerns, and the ethical implications of delegating diagnostic responsibility to AI systems.  Ultimately, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of AI in healthcare diagnostics and to illuminate its future trajectory.
