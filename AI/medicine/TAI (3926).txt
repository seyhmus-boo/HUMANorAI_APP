Antibiotic resistance poses a significant global health threat, demanding innovative solutions beyond traditional drug discovery approaches. This presentation explores the potential of quantum mechanics to address this crisis.  While classical methods struggle to accurately model the complex interactions between antibiotics and bacterial targets, quantum mechanical calculations offer unprecedented precision in determining binding affinities and reaction mechanisms. We will discuss how density functional theory (DFT) and other quantum chemistry methods can be employed to screen vast chemical libraries for novel antibiotic candidates, focusing on identifying molecules with optimized binding to resistant bacterial strains.  Furthermore, we will examine the application of quantum simulations to unravel the intricate dynamics of resistance mechanisms, such as enzymatic inactivation and efflux pump action.  By elucidating the underlying quantum mechanical processes, we can potentially design antibiotics that circumvent resistance pathways, and develop strategies to overcome the limitations of existing therapies. This presentation will highlight recent advances and future prospects of quantum-based approaches in combating this critical global challenge, paving the way for more effective and sustainable antibiotic development.
