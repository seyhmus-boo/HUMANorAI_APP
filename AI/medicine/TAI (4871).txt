Historically, adolescent mental health disorders were often overlooked, attributed to typical teenage angst, or inadequately addressed.  However, recent decades have witnessed a significant shift, with increasing recognition of the prevalence and severity of conditions such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse disorders in this vulnerable population.  Trends indicate a concerning rise in these disorders, potentially linked to factors like increased social media usage, academic pressures, and societal changes.  

Treatment approaches have evolved from primarily psychoanalytic methods to encompass a broader spectrum of evidence-based interventions.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) are now widely used, alongside medication management for specific disorders.  Family-based therapies are also crucial, recognizing the family system's significant impact on adolescent well-being.  Early identification and intervention are paramount, leveraging school-based screening programs and collaborative care models involving mental health professionals, educators, and families to ensure optimal outcomes. Continued research into etiology and more effective, accessible treatments remains a critical priority.
