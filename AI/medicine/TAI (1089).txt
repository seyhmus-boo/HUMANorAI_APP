Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This abstract summarizes the established and emerging linkages between a changing climate and human health outcomes.  Rising temperatures are directly associated with increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns contribute to the spread of vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever, altering their geographical distribution and incidence.  Extreme weather events, including floods, droughts, and wildfires, cause immediate injuries and fatalities, and disrupt healthcare infrastructure and access to essential services, leading to long-term health consequences.  Furthermore, climate change impacts food security and water resources, exacerbating malnutrition and increasing the risk of diarrheal diseases.  Air pollution, exacerbated by climate change, contributes to respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses.  Addressing climate change, therefore, is not solely an environmental imperative but a critical public health intervention.  Future research should focus on quantifying the specific health impacts of climate change across diverse populations and developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies to minimize its detrimental effects on global health equity.
