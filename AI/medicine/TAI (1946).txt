The understanding of cancer's genetic basis has revolutionized oncology, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Early research, focusing primarily on cytogenetic analyses, revealed chromosomal abnormalities in cancerous cells, establishing a link between genetic alterations and uncontrolled proliferation.  However, the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies dramatically expanded our knowledge, identifying a multitude of somatic mutations, including point mutations, insertions, deletions, and copy number variations, driving oncogenesis. These mutations often affect genes involved in cell cycle regulation (e.g., TP53, RB1), DNA repair (e.g., BRCA1/2), and signal transduction pathways (e.g., EGFR, KRAS).  This wealth of genomic information has enabled the development of targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors specific to mutated EGFR in lung cancer, representing a paradigm shift from cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Furthermore, pharmacogenomics investigates the influence of individual genetic variations on drug response, allowing for the prediction of treatment efficacy and toxicity, optimizing patient selection for specific therapies and minimizing adverse events. While challenges remain in translating genomic data into clinically effective strategies, personalized cancer medicine, based on a comprehensive understanding of the tumor's genetic landscape, offers the promise of more effective and less toxic treatments tailored to individual patients.
