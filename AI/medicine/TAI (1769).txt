Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant global health threat, jeopardizing the effectiveness of treatments for bacterial infections.  Driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, coupled with inadequate sanitation and hygiene practices, AR is accelerating globally.  Recent developments highlight the alarming scale of the problem.  Studies reveal the emergence of pan-resistant bacteria, exhibiting resistance to all available antibiotics, significantly impacting treatment outcomes and increasing mortality rates, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).  

The spread of AR is facilitated by various factors, including the movement of people and goods, leading to the global dissemination of resistant strains.  Recent research focuses on innovative strategies to combat AR, including the development of new antibiotics, exploring alternative therapies like phage therapy and antimicrobial peptides, and implementing stringent stewardship programs to optimize antibiotic use.  However, the slow pace of antibiotic discovery and the high cost of development pose substantial challenges.  Effective global collaboration, improved surveillance systems, and sustained investment in research and development are crucial to mitigate the escalating threat of AR and safeguard global health security.
