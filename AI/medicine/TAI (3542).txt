While a purely quantum mechanical description of surgical techniques is currently beyond our capabilities, a conceptual framework can be considered. Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) fundamentally strives to reduce the system's overall entropy, both in the patient (minimized tissue trauma) and the surgical environment (reduced invasiveness).  From a quantum perspective, this could be interpreted as a manipulation of the system's wave function, aiming for a final state with reduced uncertainty and maximized predictability.

Traditional open surgery represents a high-energy, high-entropy state, characterized by widespread tissue disruption.  The evolution of MIS towards laparoscopy and robotic-assisted surgery reflects a shift towards a lower-energy, lower-entropy state, achieved through precise control of energy input.  Improved visualization technologies, analogous to a more precise measurement of the system's wave function, enable surgeons to act with increased precision, thereby minimizing unwanted interactions.

The development of smaller instruments and advanced energy sources (e.g., lasers) can be considered analogous to a refined manipulation of the system's Hamiltonian, allowing for tailored energy deposition at the target site. Ultimately, future advancements in MIS might involve quantum technologies for enhanced imaging and precise energy control, leading to a further reduction in surgical invasiveness and improved patient outcomes.  However,  a complete quantum mechanical description requires a future leap in our understanding of complex biological systems.
