This presentation explores the emerging intersection of quantum mechanics and the understanding of adolescent mental health disorders.  While seemingly disparate fields, quantum-like properties of complex systems, such as the brain, suggest new avenues for investigating the underlying mechanisms of these disorders.  We argue that the inherent uncertainty and entanglement present in quantum systems provide a novel framework for comprehending the dynamic and interconnected nature of neurological processes implicated in conditions like depression, anxiety, and schizophrenia during adolescence â€“ a period marked by significant brain plasticity and hormonal fluctuations.  Traditional treatments often rely on a reductionist approach, targeting individual neurotransmitters.  However, a quantum perspective allows for considering the holistic interplay of multiple brain regions and their interconnected activity, potentially revealing novel therapeutic targets.  This presentation will review recent advancements in quantum biology and its application to neuroscience, highlighting the potential for developing novel diagnostic tools and treatment strategies. We will discuss the implications of quantum entanglement in neural networks and the possibility of exploiting quantum coherence to improve the efficacy of existing therapies, such as psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy.  Finally, we will propose avenues for future research, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to translate theoretical insights into clinically relevant applications.
