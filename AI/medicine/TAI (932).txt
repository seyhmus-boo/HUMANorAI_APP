**The Genetic Basis of Cancer: Advances in Personalized Medicine**

**Abstract**

Cancer is a complex disease driven by somatic genetic alterations.  Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the underlying genomic landscape, revealing a multitude of driver mutations and diverse mutational signatures across various cancer types. This has fueled the development of personalized medicine approaches aimed at tailoring cancer treatment to the unique genetic profile of each patient.  This presentation will explore the key genetic alterations implicated in cancer development and progression, focusing on actionable mutations that inform targeted therapies.  We will discuss the role of genomic profiling techniques, such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) and gene expression analysis, in identifying these mutations and guiding treatment decisions.  Furthermore, we will review the current successes and limitations of personalized medicine in oncology, highlighting challenges such as the identification of optimal biomarkers, the management of treatment resistance, and the ethical considerations surrounding genomic testing and data privacy. Finally, we will explore emerging strategies, including immunotherapy and gene editing technologies, which hold promise for further advancing personalized cancer therapies and improving patient outcomes.
