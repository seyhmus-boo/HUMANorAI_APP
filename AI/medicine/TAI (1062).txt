The genetic basis of cancer is increasingly understood, fueling the development of personalized medicine approaches.  However, translating this knowledge into effective clinical practice remains challenging. This presentation will explore key experimental hurdles in harnessing genomic information for cancer treatment.  We will discuss the limitations of current sequencing technologies in accurately identifying all relevant somatic mutations, particularly in heterogeneous tumor samples.  The complexities of interpreting genomic data, including the identification of driver mutations amidst passenger variations and the prediction of treatment response, will be highlighted.  Furthermore, we will address the challenges associated with developing and validating robust preclinical models that accurately recapitulate the genetic and microenvironmental complexities of human cancers.  The development of cost-effective, high-throughput screening methods to evaluate the efficacy of targeted therapies against diverse genetic profiles also presents a significant hurdle. Finally, the ethical and practical challenges of implementing personalized medicine approaches within healthcare systems, including accessibility and cost-effectiveness, will be briefly considered.  Overall, this presentation aims to foster discussion on the critical experimental challenges that must be addressed to fully realize the promise of personalized cancer medicine.
