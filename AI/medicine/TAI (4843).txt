Telemedicine has rapidly evolved into an integral component of modern healthcare delivery, significantly impacting access, efficiency, and quality of care.  Recent advancements in high-bandwidth internet access, mobile technology, and sophisticated telehealth platforms have broadened its reach and capabilities.  This abstract highlights key developments, including the expansion of telehealth services beyond routine monitoring to encompass remote diagnosis, virtual consultations, and even remote surgery enabled by robotic assistance.  The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) enhances diagnostic accuracy and personalized treatment plans through remote patient monitoring data analysis.  While challenges remain, such as ensuring data security, addressing digital health literacy disparities, and navigating regulatory frameworks, evidence increasingly demonstrates telemedicine's efficacy in managing chronic conditions, improving patient outcomes, and reducing healthcare costs.  Future research should focus on optimizing AI integration, developing standardized protocols for remote care delivery, and evaluating the long-term impact on healthcare systems, particularly in underserved populations.  The continued expansion of telemedicine promises to reshape healthcare delivery, creating a more accessible, efficient, and patient-centered system.
