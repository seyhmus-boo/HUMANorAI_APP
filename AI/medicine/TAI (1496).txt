Antibiotic resistance, a growing global crisis, represents a significant threat to human and animal health, jeopardizing the effectiveness of life-saving treatments.  This presentation will explore the historical trajectory of antibiotic resistance, tracing its emergence from the initial widespread use of penicillin in the mid-20th century to its current pervasive nature.  We will examine the key drivers of resistance, including the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human medicine, agriculture, and livestock production, coupled with the inherent evolutionary pressures favoring resistant strains.  The global implications are far-reaching, extending beyond healthcare systems.  Increased morbidity and mortality, prolonged hospital stays, escalating healthcare costs, and potential limitations in surgical procedures all contribute to a substantial economic and social burden.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the urgent need for coordinated global efforts, emphasizing the importance of stewardship programs, novel therapeutic strategies, and the development of rapid diagnostic tools to combat this escalating threat.  Finally, we will briefly consider the potential role of alternative antimicrobial approaches and the crucial need for interdisciplinary collaboration to effectively mitigate the devastating impact of antibiotic resistance.
