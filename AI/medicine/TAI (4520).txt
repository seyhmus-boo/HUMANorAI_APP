Organ transplantation, a life-saving medical marvel, presents complex ethical dilemmas requiring interdisciplinary collaboration for responsible practice. This presentation explores key ethical considerations within this field, emphasizing the crucial roles of medicine, law, philosophy, and sociology. We will examine the allocation of scarce organs, focusing on justice and fairness in prioritization systems, highlighting the tension between utilitarian and deontological approaches.  The implications of living donation, including informed consent and potential coercion, will be critically analyzed, emphasizing the need for robust legal frameworks and psychological support. Furthermore, the presentation will address the ethical complexities surrounding organ tourism and the global disparities in access to transplantation, advocating for equitable resource distribution and international cooperation.  By exploring these multifaceted issues through an interdisciplinary lens, we aim to foster a more nuanced understanding of the ethical landscape of organ transplantation and encourage collaborative efforts towards responsible and just practice.  Finally, we will briefly discuss promising future directions, such as the ethical implications of xenotransplantation and the potential of 3D-printed organs.
