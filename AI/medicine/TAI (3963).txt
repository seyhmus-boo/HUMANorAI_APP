Minimally invasive surgery (MIS) has undergone a dramatic evolution since its inception, driven by advancements in imaging, instrumentation, and surgical skills.  Early laparoscopic approaches, characterized by limited dexterity and visualization, have been progressively refined.  The introduction of robotic surgery enhanced precision and dexterity, overcoming limitations of traditional laparoscopy, particularly in complex procedures.  Concurrent developments in energy sources, such as ultrasonic and bipolar coagulation, improved hemostasis and tissue dissection, minimizing collateral damage.  Advances in 3D and augmented reality imaging further augment surgeon perception and enable more precise tissue manipulation.  These improvements translate to tangible benefits including reduced patient trauma, shorter hospital stays, faster recovery times, and decreased postoperative complications across a wide range of surgical specialties.  Examples include improved outcomes in cholecystectomy, colorectal surgery, and gynecological procedures.  Future directions include the integration of artificial intelligence for intraoperative decision support and the exploration of novel approaches such as single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery, pushing the boundaries of minimally invasive techniques and further enhancing patient care.
