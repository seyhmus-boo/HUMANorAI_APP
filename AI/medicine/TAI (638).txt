Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to understanding and mitigating its impacts.  This presentation explores the complex interplay between climate change and public health outcomes, highlighting the crucial need for collaboration across disciplines. We will examine the direct effects of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and floods, on morbidity and mortality, alongside indirect consequences like changes in vector-borne disease distribution and air quality degradation.  The presentation will further analyze the socio-economic vulnerabilities that exacerbate climate-related health risks, drawing on insights from sociology, economics, and geography to demonstrate how social inequalities shape health outcomes in the face of climate change.  We will discuss the critical role of interdisciplinary research in developing effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, encompassing epidemiological modelling, public health policy analysis, and environmental engineering.  By emphasizing the interconnectedness of climate science, public health, and the social sciences, this presentation advocates for a holistic approach that prioritizes equitable and sustainable solutions to protect public health in a changing climate.
