Climate change, driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, presents a multifaceted threat to global public health.  While traditionally approached through epidemiological and socio-economic lenses, this research explores the burgeoning field of applying quantum mechanical principles to understand and potentially mitigate its impact.  Existing research predominantly focuses on macroscopic consequences such as increased heat waves, infectious disease spread, and air pollution. However, the intricate biomolecular mechanisms underlying these impacts remain partially understood. This paper argues that a quantum mechanical perspective, focusing on the subtle yet crucial role of quantum phenomena in biological processes, offers a novel avenue for investigation.  Specifically, we will examine how changes in environmental conditions, driven by climate change, may influence quantum coherence and entanglement within crucial biomolecules, impacting their function and consequently, human health. This approach may illuminate the mechanistic basis for observed correlations between climate-related stressors and disease incidence, providing insights beyond classical thermodynamic models.  We will explore the potential of quantum computing in modelling these intricate interactions and discuss the future prospects of quantum-informed interventions for climate change-related public health challenges.
