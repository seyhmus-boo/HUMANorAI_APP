Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of microorganisms to withstand antimicrobial agents, poses a significant and escalating global threat.  The widespread use and misuse of antibiotics, coupled with inherent microbial adaptability, have driven the emergence and dissemination of resistant strains across diverse bacterial species. This phenomenon impacts healthcare systems worldwide, resulting in treatment failures, prolonged hospitalizations, and increased mortality rates, particularly concerning infections caused by multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens.  The economic burden, including escalating healthcare costs and lost productivity, is substantial and disproportionately affects low- and middle-income countries with limited access to effective treatments and infection control measures.  Furthermore, AR jeopardizes advances in modern medicine, such as organ transplantation and cancer chemotherapy, which rely heavily on effective antibiotic prophylaxis.  Global efforts to mitigate AR necessitate a multi-pronged approach encompassing responsible antibiotic stewardship, enhanced surveillance systems, the development of novel antimicrobial agents and alternative therapies, and improved sanitation and hygiene practices. Failure to address this crisis effectively could lead to a return to the pre-antibiotic era, where common infections become life-threatening.
