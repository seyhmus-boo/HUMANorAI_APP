Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, extending beyond the traditionally recognized impacts.  Recent research has underscored the increasingly complex and intertwined nature of this relationship, moving beyond simple correlations to demonstrate causal links and quantify the escalating burden of disease.  This paper examines the evolving understanding of this crucial nexus, focusing on recent developments in several key areas.  Firstly, we explore the expanding evidence base linking specific climate-related events, such as heatwaves and extreme weather, to increased morbidity and mortality rates, paying particular attention to vulnerable populations.  Secondly, we analyze the indirect impacts of climate change, including alterations in disease vector distribution and the exacerbation of food and water insecurity, resulting in malnutrition and infectious disease outbreaks.  Thirdly, we consider the emerging literature on the mental health consequences of climate change-related disasters and displacement, acknowledging the significant psychological toll of environmental stressors. Finally, we discuss recent advancements in climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies specifically designed to enhance public health resilience and preparedness. This review aims to synthesize the current state of knowledge, highlight critical knowledge gaps, and inform the development of effective public health interventions in the face of a changing climate.
