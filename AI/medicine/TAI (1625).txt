Cancer, a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell proliferation, has plagued humanity throughout history.  Early understandings, rooted in humoral theories and anatomical observations, offered limited insight into its etiology.  The 20th century witnessed a paradigm shift with the identification of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes, laying the groundwork for a genetic understanding of cancer development. This discovery revolutionized the field, revealing cancer as a disease driven by somatic mutations accumulating within the genome, leading to dysregulation of cellular processes like growth, apoptosis, and DNA repair.  

The subsequent mapping of the human genome further accelerated progress, providing a comprehensive blueprint for identifying cancer-associated genes and variations.  This wealth of genomic information has fueled the emergence of personalized medicine, allowing for the stratification of patients based on their individual genetic profiles.  This approach moves beyond traditional, one-size-fits-all treatments towards targeted therapies tailored to the specific genetic mutations driving a patient's cancer. This paper will explore recent advances in understanding the genetic basis of cancer and critically analyze their translation into the clinical arena of personalized cancer treatment, focusing on the challenges and successes of this rapidly evolving field.
