Climate change significantly impacts public health through a complex interplay of environmental and social determinants.  This necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, integrating expertise from climatology, epidemiology, public health, sociology, and economics.  Direct effects include increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, exacerbated respiratory illnesses due to worsened air quality, and the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever through shifting geographic ranges.  Indirect consequences stem from changes in food security, water scarcity, and displacement due to extreme weather events, leading to malnutrition, infectious disease outbreaks, and mental health issues related to trauma and insecurity.

Furthermore, socioeconomic disparities exacerbate climate change's health impacts, with vulnerable populations disproportionately affected.  Interdisciplinary research is crucial for understanding these disparities, developing effective adaptation strategies, and promoting climate-resilient healthcare systems. This includes modelling future health risks under various climate scenarios, evaluating the cost-effectiveness of interventions, and engaging with policymakers to integrate health considerations into climate policy.  Ultimately, addressing the intertwined challenges of climate change and public health demands a holistic, interdisciplinary framework to ensure equitable and effective mitigation and adaptation strategies.
