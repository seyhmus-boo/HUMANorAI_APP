Ethical considerations in organ transplantation are typically framed within classical bioethics, focusing on informed consent, distributive justice, and the potential for coercion. This presentation proposes a novel perspective, exploring the ethical implications through the lens of quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate, quantum phenomena such as entanglement and superposition offer intriguing parallels to the complex interconnectedness of donor, recipient, and their families.  We argue that the traditional focus on individual autonomy may be insufficient to capture the inherent interconnectedness implied by the transfer of a vital organ, a quantum “system” whose properties are fundamentally altered during transplantation.  The superposition of the donor's life before and after donation, as well as the recipient’s pre- and post-transplant states, presents ethical challenges not easily addressed by classical ethical frameworks.  Furthermore, the entanglement between donor and recipient, even after the physical separation of the organ, raises questions about the ongoing ethical responsibility towards the donor's legacy.  This presentation will explore these unconventional quantum-inspired perspectives, challenging traditional ethical frameworks and prompting a more holistic understanding of the ethical complexities inherent in organ transplantation.  We propose that a quantum-informed bioethics could offer a richer and more nuanced approach to this crucial field.
