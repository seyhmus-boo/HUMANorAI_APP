This presentation examines evolving trends and treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents, acknowledging a historical context marked by underrecognition and inadequate support.  Historically, adolescent mental health issues were often minimized or attributed to developmental phases, hindering early intervention and appropriate care.  However, recent decades have witnessed a significant rise in reported cases of anxiety, depression, and self-harm, necessitating a reassessment of both prevalence and effective therapeutic approaches.  We will explore the contributing factors behind these shifts, including societal pressures, technological advancements, and evolving diagnostic criteria.  The presentation will further analyze contemporary treatment modalities,  contrasting traditional approaches like psychotherapy and medication with newer interventions, such as mindfulness-based therapies and digital mental health platforms.  Finally, we will discuss challenges in access to timely and appropriate care, focusing on the need for integrated service delivery models that address the unique developmental needs of this vulnerable population.  The presentation aims to stimulate discussion on improving prevention strategies and optimizing treatment outcomes for adolescents struggling with mental health disorders.
