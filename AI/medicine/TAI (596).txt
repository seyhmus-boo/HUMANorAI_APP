Cancer's genetic basis has been understood incrementally, beginning with early observations of familial cancer predisposition.  The discovery of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes revolutionized the field, revealing that cancer arises from accumulated genetic alterations disrupting cellular regulation.  These alterations, encompassing point mutations, chromosomal rearrangements, and epigenetic modifications, affect pathways controlling cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.

Recent advances in genomics, particularly next-generation sequencing, have profoundly impacted our understanding.  Detailed genomic profiling of individual tumors allows identification of specific driver mutations underpinning tumorigenesis.  This knowledge fuels the development of personalized medicine, tailoring therapeutic strategies to the unique genetic profile of a patient's cancer.  Targeted therapies, designed to inhibit specific oncogenic proteins, represent a significant leap forward, offering increased efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Furthermore, immunotherapy, leveraging the patient's immune system to target cancer-specific mutations, is increasingly reliant on genomic information to predict response and select appropriate candidates.  Ongoing research focuses on integrating multi-omic data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics) to refine predictive models and further personalize cancer treatment.
