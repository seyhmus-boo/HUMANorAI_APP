Cancer is a genetically heterogeneous disease driven by somatic mutations accumulating throughout a lifetime.  Advances in genomic sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic landscape underlying cancer development and progression, revealing diverse driver mutations and complex interactions between genes, epigenetic modifications, and the tumor microenvironment.  This increased knowledge fuels the development of personalized medicine approaches, significantly impacting cancer diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.  Targeted therapies, designed to specifically inhibit the products of oncogenic driver mutations, demonstrate improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to conventional chemotherapies.  Furthermore,  biomarker discovery, facilitated by genomic profiling, enables patient stratification for optimal treatment selection, including immunotherapy, based on tumor mutational burden or expression of specific immune checkpoints.  Ongoing challenges include identifying actionable mutations in diverse cancer types, addressing treatment resistance arising from clonal evolution, and mitigating the cost and accessibility barriers associated with comprehensive genomic testing.  However, the integration of genomic information with clinical data promises to further enhance the precision and effectiveness of cancer care, ultimately improving patient outcomes and survival.
