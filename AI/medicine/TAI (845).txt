Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This paper investigates the complex and evolving relationship between climate change and its impacts on human health outcomes.  We examine a range of climate-sensitive health risks, including the increased incidence of heat-related illnesses, vector-borne diseases, respiratory problems exacerbated by air pollution, and the impact of extreme weather events on physical and mental health.  Furthermore, the study explores the indirect consequences of climate change, such as food insecurity, displacement, and conflict, and their contribution to public health vulnerabilities.  Existing literature predominantly focuses on specific climate-health linkages; however, this research adopts a more holistic approach, synthesizing evidence across multiple disciplines to provide a comprehensive understanding of the interconnectedness between environmental change and population health. The paper assesses the current evidence base, highlighting knowledge gaps and research priorities, while also discussing the implications for public health policy and intervention strategies aimed at mitigating the adverse health effects of climate change.  Ultimately, the research aims to underscore the urgent need for integrated and proactive approaches to address this critical global challenge.
