Adolescents experience a significant burden of mental health disorders, with trends indicating rising prevalence rates across various conditions, including anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders.  This increase is attributed to complex interplay of factors encompassing societal changes (e.g., increased social media usage, academic pressures), biological vulnerabilities, and inadequate access to timely and appropriate care.  Treatment approaches often integrate evidence-based interventions tailored to the developmental stage. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) have demonstrated efficacy in managing anxiety and mood disorders, while family-based therapies address familial dynamics contributing to adolescent mental health challenges.  Pharmacological interventions, though sometimes necessary, are typically used in conjunction with psychotherapy and require careful consideration of potential side effects.  A concerning trend is the disparity in access to mental health services, particularly for marginalized adolescents, highlighting the need for culturally sensitive and equitable interventions. Future research should focus on preventative strategies targeting risk factors, improving early identification through screening programs, and enhancing accessibility and affordability of comprehensive mental health services for all adolescents.
