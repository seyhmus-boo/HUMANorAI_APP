This review summarizes current trends and treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents.  Prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors are significantly increasing, demanding urgent attention to early intervention strategies.  Technological advancements, including telehealth and mobile applications, offer promising avenues for expanding access to care, particularly in underserved populations.  However, disparities in access to evidence-based treatments, including psychotherapy and medication, persist across socioeconomic and racial groups. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and other evidence-based psychotherapies remain cornerstones of treatment, although their efficacy varies across disorders and individual needs.  Pharmacological interventions, while sometimes necessary, are increasingly accompanied by concerns regarding potential long-term side effects and require careful monitoring.  Future research should focus on identifying predictive biomarkers for treatment response, refining personalized treatment approaches, and addressing the societal factors contributing to the rising prevalence of mental health disorders in this vulnerable population.  A multi-faceted approach encompassing prevention, early intervention, and comprehensive care is crucial to improve adolescent mental health outcomes.
