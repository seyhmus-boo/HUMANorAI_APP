Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to public health globally. This presentation explores the complex interplay between a changing climate and various health outcomes, moving beyond simple correlations to highlight causal pathways.  We will examine direct impacts, such as increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the expansion of vector-borne diseases, and the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to air pollution amplified by wildfires and extreme weather events.  Furthermore, the presentation will address indirect impacts, including malnutrition stemming from disrupted agricultural systems, mental health challenges related to displacement and trauma from climate-related disasters, and the increased risk of waterborne diseases due to flooding and contamination.  We will synthesize existing literature to showcase the disproportionate burden borne by vulnerable populations, highlighting the urgent need for climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies that integrate public health considerations.  Finally, we propose a framework for future research, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaborations and the development of effective, equitable, and context-specific public health interventions to address the escalating health challenges posed by climate change.
