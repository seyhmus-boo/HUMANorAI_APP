Cancer is a complex disease driven by somatic mutations accumulating across multiple genes.  Advances in next-generation sequencing technologies have revolutionized our understanding of the genetic landscape of various cancers, revealing the intricate interplay of oncogenes, tumor suppressor genes, and DNA repair pathways. This improved genomic characterization underpins the burgeoning field of personalized medicine, enabling the stratification of patients based on their unique tumor profiles.  Targeted therapies, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors, are now tailored to specific genomic alterations, offering improved efficacy and reduced toxicity compared to traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy.  Furthermore, the identification of predictive biomarkers allows for the selection of patients most likely to benefit from specific treatments, maximizing therapeutic benefit and minimizing adverse events.  Challenges remain, including the complexity of interpreting large genomic datasets, the identification of actionable mutations, and the development of effective therapies for cancers with limited targetable mutations.  Ongoing research focusing on functional genomics, liquid biopsies, and artificial intelligence-driven approaches promises further refinement of personalized cancer therapies, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.
