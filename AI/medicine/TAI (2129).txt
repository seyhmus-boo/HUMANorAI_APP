Antibiotic resistance (AR), a critical global health threat, arises from the evolutionary adaptation of bacteria to antimicrobial agents.  This poses immense challenges experimentally.  Firstly, accurately predicting the emergence and spread of resistant strains remains difficult.  Current *in vitro* models often fail to capture the complex ecological interactions within human hosts and diverse environmental reservoirs, leading to inaccurate estimations of resistance development rates and transmission dynamics.  Secondly, studying AR in diverse bacterial populations requires sophisticated genomic and phenotypic characterization techniques capable of identifying subtle mutations conferring resistance and differentiating between inherent and acquired resistance mechanisms.  Furthermore, evaluating the efficacy of novel antimicrobials and interventions presents significant challenges.  Developing robust, standardized assays that accurately reflect *in vivo* conditions, including host immune responses and the complex microbiome, is crucial but complex.  Finally, studying the socio-economic dimensions of AR, such as antibiotic stewardship and the impact on healthcare systems, necessitates large-scale epidemiological studies and modelling approaches, presenting logistical and data-gathering hurdles.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is paramount to developing effective strategies against this global threat.
