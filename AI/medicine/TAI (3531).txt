Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat to public health, jeopardizing the efficacy of treatments for bacterial infections.  Driven by the overuse and misuse of antibiotics in human and veterinary medicine, agriculture, and aquaculture, AR manifests in diverse bacterial species, impacting a broad spectrum of infections. This widespread resistance compromises treatment options, leading to prolonged illness, increased mortality, and substantial healthcare costs.  The global implications are profound, affecting low- and middle-income countries disproportionately due to limited access to effective antibiotics and robust infection control measures.  AR exacerbates existing healthcare inequalities, hindering progress towards achieving sustainable development goals related to health and well-being.  Furthermore, the emergence of multidrug-resistant organisms necessitates the urgent development and implementation of comprehensive strategies, including improved antimicrobial stewardship, infection prevention and control practices, diagnostic innovations, and accelerated research into novel therapeutic approaches.  Addressing AR requires a global, One Health approach, integrating human, animal, and environmental health strategies to mitigate its devastating impact on global health security.
