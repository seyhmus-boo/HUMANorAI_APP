This review summarizes current trends and treatments for mental health disorders in adolescents.  Prevalence rates for anxiety, depression, and substance use disorders continue to rise globally, with significant disparities based on socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and gender.  Early onset and persistent symptoms are increasingly recognized as predictors of long-term functional impairment.  While traditional pharmacological interventions remain a cornerstone of treatment, particularly for severe disorders, there is growing emphasis on integrated approaches.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) demonstrate effectiveness in managing a range of adolescent mental health challenges.  Furthermore, family-based therapies, focusing on improving communication and reducing conflict, are increasingly implemented.  Technological advancements, including telehealth and mobile applications, offer promising avenues for increasing access to care and delivering personalized interventions.  However, significant challenges remain, including limited access to specialized mental health services, inadequate training of healthcare professionals, and persistent stigma surrounding mental illness. Future research should focus on developing and evaluating culturally sensitive, evidence-based interventions tailored to specific adolescent needs and utilizing innovative technological platforms to bridge existing service gaps.
