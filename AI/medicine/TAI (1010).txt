This presentation explores the nascent field of applying quantum mechanical principles to understand the complex relationship between climate change and public health. While traditionally studied through classical frameworks, we posit that a quantum perspective can offer novel insights into the emergent properties of this interconnected system. We argue that the non-linear and probabilistic nature of climate change impacts, such as extreme weather events and disease outbreaks, aligns with quantum principles of superposition and entanglement.  For instance, the complex interplay of various environmental factors contributing to vector-borne diseases can be conceptually modeled using quantum entanglement, highlighting the interconnectedness of seemingly disparate factors.  Further, the uncertainty inherent in predicting climate change impacts mirrors the inherent uncertainty in quantum measurement.  This presentation will explore the potential of quantum computing to model and predict these complex interactions more accurately than classical methods, particularly in analyzing large datasets of climate and health information.  We will discuss potential applications of quantum algorithms, such as quantum machine learning, in forecasting disease outbreaks and assessing the effectiveness of public health interventions under various climate change scenarios. Finally, we will identify key research challenges and opportunities in developing a comprehensive quantum-informed framework for understanding the climate change-public health nexus.
