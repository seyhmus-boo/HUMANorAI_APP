Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to fully understand and mitigate its impacts.  This research paper explores the complex and interconnected relationship between climate change and public health outcomes, highlighting the crucial need for collaboration across diverse fields.  While traditionally viewed through the lens of environmental science, the consequences of a changing climate profoundly impact human health across a spectrum of disciplines, including epidemiology, sociology, economics, and political science.  This paper will examine the direct and indirect pathways through which climate change affects human well-being, focusing on phenomena such as the increased incidence of heat-related illnesses, the expansion of vector-borne diseases, the disruption of food security, and the exacerbation of mental health challenges.  Furthermore, it will investigate the social determinants of health within the context of climate change, analyzing how vulnerabilities are differentially distributed across populations and considering the implications for health equity.  By integrating perspectives from various disciplines, we aim to offer a comprehensive understanding of this crucial issue and identify effective strategies for building climate-resilient health systems.
