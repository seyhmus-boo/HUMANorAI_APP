Cancer is a complex disease driven by somatic mutations accumulating across multiple genes.  Recent advances in genomics, particularly next-generation sequencing (NGS), have revolutionized our understanding of its genetic basis, paving the way for personalized medicine.  Whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing now routinely identify driver mutations and specific mutational signatures, allowing for more accurate prognosis and targeted therapies.  The identification of novel oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes through large-scale genomic studies continues to expand our knowledge of cancer development across diverse tumor types.  Furthermore, advancements in liquid biopsies, utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), offer minimally invasive approaches for early detection, monitoring treatment response, and detecting recurrence.  These technologies, combined with improved bioinformatic analyses and machine learning algorithms, are enabling the prediction of drug response and the identification of potential therapeutic vulnerabilities specific to individual patients. While challenges remain in translating these discoveries into widespread clinical practice, the convergence of genomics, bioinformatics, and targeted therapies represents a significant step towards truly personalized cancer care.  Future research should focus on elucidating the complex interplay of genetic and epigenetic factors to further enhance the precision and efficacy of personalized cancer treatments.
