Climate change poses a significant and multifaceted threat to global public health.  This research paper examines the complex and evolving relationship between climate change and its impacts on human health, moving beyond the well-established links to explore nuanced interactions and emerging challenges.  We analyze the direct effects of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, floods, and droughts, on morbidity and mortality rates, considering variations across different populations and geographical locations.  Furthermore, the indirect consequences of climate change, including alterations in vector-borne disease prevalence, air pollution levels, and food security, are critically assessed.  This investigation utilizes a systematic review of existing literature, encompassing epidemiological studies, modelling projections, and policy analyses.  The paper highlights the disproportionate burden of climate change-related health impacts on vulnerable populations, including low-income communities and marginalized groups.  Finally, we discuss implications for public health interventions and policy responses, emphasizing the need for integrated strategies that address both climate mitigation and adaptation to safeguard global health in the face of a changing climate.
