Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes.  This presentation traces the evolution of MIS, highlighting key technological advancements and their impact on surgical approaches.  We will explore the transition from early laparoscopic procedures, characterized by limited instrumentation and visualization, to the current era of robotic-assisted surgery and advanced imaging modalities.  Emphasis will be placed on the progressive refinement of instruments, including the development of smaller, more dexterous tools and improved energy sources.  Furthermore, we will discuss the significant contributions of enhanced visualization techniques, such as high-definition 3D imaging and fluorescence-guided surgery, in improving precision and minimizing complications.  The presentation will also analyze the ongoing development of novel techniques such as single-port and natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery (NOTES), examining their potential benefits and limitations.  Finally, we will consider future directions in MIS, including the integration of artificial intelligence and augmented reality technologies to further optimize surgical outcomes and expand the application of minimally invasive approaches.
