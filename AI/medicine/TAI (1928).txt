Cancer's genetic basis is increasingly understood, driving significant advancements in personalized medicine.  The identification of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes driving individual cancers allows for targeted therapeutic interventions.  Next-generation sequencing technologies enable comprehensive profiling of a patient's tumor, revealing its unique mutational landscape.  This information guides the selection of appropriate therapies, maximizing efficacy and minimizing adverse effects.

For instance, identifying EGFR mutations in lung cancer allows for the targeted application of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, demonstrably improving patient outcomes compared to conventional chemotherapy.  Similarly, BRAF mutations in melanoma are effectively targeted by BRAF inhibitors.  Beyond single-gene mutations, the analysis of the tumor microenvironment, immune profiling, and genomic instability contributes to a holistic understanding facilitating treatment strategy selection.   This personalized approach, informed by the genetic fingerprint of the cancer, marks a paradigm shift from broad-spectrum therapies toward precision oncology, ultimately improving cancer survival rates and quality of life.
