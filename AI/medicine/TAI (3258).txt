While a direct quantum mechanical explanation of the relationship between climate change and public health is not currently feasible, a conceptual framework can be constructed leveraging quantum principles to illuminate the complex interplay.  Climate change, driven by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, instigates a cascade of macroscopic effects, each potentially modeled via statistical mechanics, an emergent property of quantum systems.  For instance, alterations in atmospheric and oceanic circulation patterns, described by complex, multi-body quantum systems at the molecular level, impact weather extremes. Increased frequency and intensity of heatwaves, predicted via climate models incorporating quantum-based atmospheric physics, directly cause heat stroke and exacerbate cardiovascular diseases.  Furthermore, changes in precipitation patterns influence the distribution and abundance of disease vectors such as mosquitos, influencing the spread of diseases like malaria and dengue fever, again emergent phenomena from complex interactions described by quantum mechanics at the fundamental level. Rising sea levels, another consequence of climate change, contribute to displacement and increased exposure to waterborne pathogens, impacting public health in multifaceted ways that could be analyzed through the lens of quantum information theory regarding information flow in complex systems.  Therefore, while not directly applied, the foundational principles of quantum mechanics underpin the physical processes driving the observed impacts of climate change on global public health.
