This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and the established relationship between climate change and public health. While seemingly disparate fields, a quantum mechanical perspective offers unique insights into the complex, interconnected systems underlying this critical issue.  We argue that the inherent uncertainties and probabilistic nature of climate change impacts, as modeled through increasingly sophisticated quantum computational methods, can be leveraged to enhance public health preparedness.  Specifically, we discuss how quantum computing can improve the accuracy and speed of predictive modeling for vector-borne disease outbreaks, heat stress events, and air pollution, allowing for more timely and targeted public health interventions. Furthermore, the exploration of quantum entanglement in complex biological systems – relevant to understanding the impacts of environmental stressors on human health – provides a new theoretical framework for researching the mechanistic links between climate change and disease manifestation.  We will present preliminary findings on the application of quantum machine learning to predict the spatial distribution of vulnerable populations, highlighting the potential for quantum-enhanced strategies in mitigating climate-related health risks. This work underscores the emerging role of quantum mechanics not just in understanding the physical processes of climate change, but also in improving public health responses and resilience.
