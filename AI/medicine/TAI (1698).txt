The relationship between climate change and public health is complex and increasingly critical.  Historically, climate variability has influenced disease patterns, with warmer temperatures correlating with increased vector-borne illnesses like malaria and dengue fever.  However, anthropogenic climate change amplifies these impacts, projecting more frequent and intense extreme weather events.  Heat waves directly cause morbidity and mortality, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Changes in precipitation patterns affect waterborne diseases and food security, leading to malnutrition and associated health problems.  Sea-level rise contributes to displacement and mental health issues resulting from trauma and loss.  Furthermore, altered ecosystems can facilitate the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases, potentially leading to future pandemics.  Indirectly, climate change exacerbates existing health inequalities, disproportionately affecting marginalized communities with limited access to healthcare and resources.  Addressing climate change is thus essential not only for environmental sustainability but also for safeguarding global public health.  The interconnectedness demands integrated strategies encompassing mitigation, adaptation, and robust healthcare systems capable of managing the projected surge in climate-sensitive health impacts.
