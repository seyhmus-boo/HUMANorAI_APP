Adolescents experience a heightened vulnerability to mental health disorders, with prevalence rates steadily increasing in recent years.  This rise is likely multifactorial, encompassing societal pressures, increased screen time, and evolving diagnostic criteria.  Anxiety disorders, including generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder, represent a significant portion of diagnoses, followed by mood disorders, particularly depression and bipolar disorder.  Substance use disorders frequently co-occur with these primary diagnoses, complicating treatment and prognosis.  Treatment approaches are evolving, integrating evidence-based practices tailored to the developmental stage of the adolescent.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) remain cornerstones of therapeutic intervention, often augmented by family-based therapies to address systemic influences.  Pharmacological interventions, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants, are frequently employed, but require careful monitoring due to potential side effects and the need for individualized dosing.  Further research is crucial to understand the complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors contributing to these trends and to refine treatment strategies that maximize efficacy and minimize adverse outcomes in this vulnerable population.  Future investigations should prioritize early intervention strategies and the development of accessible and culturally sensitive care models.
