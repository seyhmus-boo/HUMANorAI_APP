Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and multifaceted global threat, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation.  The rise of AR is driven by complex interactions between human behavior (overuse and misuse of antibiotics in healthcare and agriculture), microbial evolution (horizontal gene transfer and mutations), and environmental factors (antibiotic residues in wastewater and soil). This necessitates collaboration across medicine, veterinary science, microbiology, ecology, engineering, and social sciences.  Medical research focuses on novel antibiotic development and diagnostic tools, while veterinary science investigates responsible antibiotic stewardship in livestock production.  Environmental scientists analyze the dissemination of resistant bacteria and antibiotic residues in various ecosystems.  Engineers contribute through the development of wastewater treatment technologies to reduce antibiotic pollution.  Finally, social scientists explore the behavioral and socioeconomic factors influencing antibiotic consumption and promoting responsible use.  Successfully combating AR requires integrated strategies targeting all these aspects.  A One Health approach, emphasizing the interconnectedness of human, animal, and environmental health, is crucial for developing and implementing effective, sustainable solutions to this global crisis.  Failure to act decisively will lead to a post-antibiotic era with devastating consequences for global health and economic stability.
