Antibiotic resistance, a phenomenon where microorganisms evolve mechanisms to withstand antibiotic treatment, poses a significant and escalating global threat. This presentation explores the historical context of antibiotic resistance, tracing its emergence from the early days of antibiotic discovery in the mid-20th century to its current, pervasive prevalence.  Initially hailed as miracle drugs, antibiotics rapidly altered the landscape of infectious disease control. However, the widespread and often indiscriminate use of antibiotics, coupled with inadequate infection control practices, inadvertently fueled the selection and proliferation of resistant strains.  This has led to a global crisis, impacting healthcare systems, agricultural practices, and economic stability.  The abstract will detail the key mechanisms of resistance, including mutation, horizontal gene transfer, and biofilm formation,  highlighting the challenges in developing new antibiotics and the increasing limitations of existing treatments.  It will further discuss the crucial implications of this crisis, ranging from increased morbidity and mortality rates to the rising costs of healthcare and the potential for untreatable infections.  Finally, the presentation will briefly outline potential strategies to mitigate the global threat of antibiotic resistance through responsible antibiotic stewardship, enhanced surveillance, and the development of novel therapeutic approaches.
