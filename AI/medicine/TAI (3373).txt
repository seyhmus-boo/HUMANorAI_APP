Climate change poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective mitigation and adaptation strategies. This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between climate change and public health, highlighting the crucial interconnections between environmental science, epidemiology, sociology, and public policy.  We will examine the direct impacts of climate change, such as increased heat-related morbidity and mortality, the expansion of vector-borne diseases, and the exacerbation of respiratory illnesses due to air pollution.  Further, we will discuss the indirect consequences, including mental health impacts from climate-related disasters and displacement, and the social determinants of health exacerbated by climate change-induced inequalities.  The presentation will emphasize the need for collaborative research across disciplines to develop robust predictive models, identify vulnerable populations, and design effective public health interventions.  Finally, we will explore the potential for integrating climate change considerations into existing public health frameworks and policies, promoting a more holistic and proactive approach to safeguarding global well-being.
