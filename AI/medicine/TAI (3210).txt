Antimicrobial resistance (AMR), particularly antibiotic resistance, poses a significant and escalating threat to global health security.  The effectiveness of antibiotics, cornerstones of modern medicine, is rapidly diminishing due to the widespread misuse and overuse of these life-saving drugs, coupled with the intrinsic capacity of bacteria to evolve resistance mechanisms.  Recent developments underscore the urgency of this crisis.  The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) pathogens, such as carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis, highlights the limitations of current therapeutic options.  Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the problem, disrupting supply chains and increasing antibiotic usage in both human and animal healthcare.  Recent studies have also revealed alarming trends in the spread of resistance genes through various vectors, including the environment and the food chain, necessitating a One Health approach to tackle this complex challenge. This paper will delve into the multifaceted nature of antibiotic resistance, analyzing its global implications across healthcare, agriculture, and the environment, while also exploring promising advancements in research and innovative strategies for combating this critical public health issue.
