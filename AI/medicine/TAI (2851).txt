Ethical considerations in organ transplantation remain a complex and evolving area demanding ongoing scrutiny. This presentation examines key ethical dilemmas inherent in the process, focusing on three principal areas: donor consent and autonomy, equitable allocation of scarce resources, and the potential for exploitation and coercion.  We analyze the tension between respecting individual autonomy in deceased donation (e.g., presumed consent vs. explicit consent) and the overriding societal need for organs.  Further, we explore the ethical challenges posed by disparate access to transplantation based on socioeconomic factors, geographic location, and other disparities, arguing for the implementation of just and transparent allocation systems.  Finally, the presentation addresses the vulnerability of potential living donors, emphasizing the need for robust safeguards against undue influence and coercion, particularly within vulnerable populations.  By critically analyzing these ethical dimensions, we aim to stimulate discussion and promote best practices in organ transplantation to ensure equitable and ethically sound practices for all stakeholders.
