Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global threat, jeopardizing modern medicine and public health infrastructure. This presentation will address the critical experimental challenges hindering our understanding and mitigation of AR.  The complex interplay between bacterial genetics, environmental factors, and human behavior necessitates sophisticated experimental designs to accurately reflect real-world scenarios.  We will discuss the limitations of current *in vitro* models, highlighting the need for more sophisticated *in vivo* and *in silico* approaches capable of capturing the intricacies of bacterial evolution and transmission dynamics within diverse host environments.  The inherent heterogeneity of bacterial populations and the difficulty in accurately mimicking the complex microbiota of various host niches represent significant hurdles. Furthermore, the challenges associated with translating research findings into effective clinical strategies will be examined, including the complexities of developing novel antibiotics and implementing effective antimicrobial stewardship programs globally.  We will conclude by emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaborations and the development of innovative experimental methodologies to combat this burgeoning global crisis.
