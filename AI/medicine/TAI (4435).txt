The prevention of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes, is significantly influenced by nutrition, highlighting the need for an interdisciplinary approach.  Nutritional science, underpinned by biochemistry and physiology, elucidates the role of macronutrients and micronutrients in metabolic processes.  Inadequate intake of fruits and vegetables, rich in antioxidants and fibre, is linked to increased oxidative stress and impaired gut microbiota composition, factors implicated in chronic inflammation â€“ a hallmark of many diseases.  Conversely, diets high in saturated and trans fats contribute to dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis.

This understanding necessitates collaboration with other disciplines.  Epidemiology provides population-level data on dietary patterns and disease prevalence, informing public health interventions.  Psychology contributes to understanding behavioural factors influencing food choices, enabling the development of tailored interventions addressing individual needs and cultural contexts.  Furthermore, economics plays a crucial role in shaping food accessibility and affordability, influencing dietary habits within specific socio-economic groups.  This interdisciplinary integration is crucial for effective chronic disease prevention strategies, transcending the limitations of a purely nutritional focus.
