Mental health disorders are increasingly prevalent among adolescents, posing significant challenges to individual well-being and societal resources. This abstract reviews recent trends and treatment approaches for these conditions.  Data indicate a rising incidence of anxiety, depression, and self-harm behaviors in this population, potentially linked to factors such as increased social media use, academic pressures, and societal changes.  Treatment strategies have evolved, moving beyond traditional approaches.  Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and other evidence-based psychotherapies remain cornerstones, demonstrating efficacy in reducing symptoms and improving functional outcomes.  Pharmacological interventions, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other antidepressants, are sometimes utilized, but their prescription requires careful consideration of potential side effects and individualized risk assessment.  A growing emphasis is placed on integrated care models, encompassing mental and physical health services alongside social support systems.  Future research should focus on early identification and prevention strategies, tailored interventions addressing specific cultural contexts and comorbidities, and the development of accessible and affordable treatment options to mitigate the rising burden of adolescent mental health disorders.  Technological advancements, such as telehealth platforms, offer promising avenues for improving access to care, particularly in underserved communities.
