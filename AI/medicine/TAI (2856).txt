Adolescent mental health disorders, encompassing conditions like anxiety, depression, and substance abuse, are exhibiting concerning upward trends globally.  This surge is attributed to complex interplay of biological predispositions, socio-environmental factors (e.g., social media pressures, academic stress), and societal changes.  Effective treatment necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, transcending the limitations of a purely medical model.

Psychology plays a crucial role, offering therapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) to address maladaptive thought patterns and behaviors.  Psychiatry contributes through medication management, particularly for severe cases requiring pharmacological intervention.  Social work addresses the socio-environmental determinants, connecting adolescents and families with support systems and navigating systemic barriers.  Furthermore, educational institutions provide crucial early intervention and preventative strategies, fostering mental health literacy and creating supportive school environments.  A collaborative approach, involving these disciplines alongside family members and the adolescent themselves, offers the best prospect for effective diagnosis, treatment, and long-term positive outcomes.  The ongoing challenge lies in integrating these perspectives and ensuring seamless communication across disciplines.
