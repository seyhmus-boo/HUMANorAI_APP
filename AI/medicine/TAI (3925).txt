Ethical considerations in organ transplantation have evolved alongside advancements in surgical techniques and immunosuppression.  Historically, transplantation was hampered by a severe shortage of organs, leading to practices now considered unethical, such as the appropriation of organs from executed prisoners without informed consent (common in some countries during the 20th century).  This underscored the urgent need for robust ethical frameworks.

Contemporary challenges revolve around equitable allocation of scarce resources.  The development of sophisticated allocation systems aimed at maximizing benefit necessitates careful consideration of factors such as medical urgency, waiting time, and tissue compatibility, often alongside social justice concerns regarding disparities in access based on socioeconomic status or geographic location.  Further ethical dilemmas arise in defining death (brain death vs. cardiopulmonary death), managing informed consent (especially in cases of incapacitated donors), and navigating conflicts of interest among healthcare professionals involved in the process.

This presentation will examine the historical trajectory of ethical dilemmas in organ transplantation, analyze current challenges in organ allocation and informed consent, and discuss the importance of ongoing ethical deliberation and the development of transparent and equitable allocation systems to ensure the integrity and fairness of this life-saving medical practice.
