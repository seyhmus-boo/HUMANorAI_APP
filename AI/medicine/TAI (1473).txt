Minimally invasive surgical (MIS) techniques have revolutionized surgical practice, offering patients reduced trauma, faster recovery times, and improved cosmetic outcomes. This presentation traces the evolution of MIS, highlighting key technological advancements and their impact on surgical approaches.  We will explore the transition from early laparoscopic procedures, initially limited by instrumentation and visualization challenges, to the sophisticated robotic and single-port techniques employed today.  The development of enhanced energy sources, such as ultrasonic and bipolar coagulation, will be discussed in relation to improved precision and hemostasis.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the integration of advanced imaging modalities, including 3D laparoscopy and intraoperative fluorescence imaging, which significantly enhance surgical visualization and precision.  Finally, we will examine current trends and future directions in MIS, including the potential of artificial intelligence and augmented reality to further refine surgical techniques and expand the scope of minimally invasive approaches.  The presentation concludes by reflecting on the ongoing evolution of MIS and its potential to redefine surgical care in the years to come.
