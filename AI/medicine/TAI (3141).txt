Antibiotic resistance (AR), the ability of bacteria to withstand the effects of antimicrobial drugs, poses a significant and escalating threat to global public health.  This phenomenon, no longer confined to clinical settings, presents a complex challenge demanding an interdisciplinary approach to address its multifaceted nature. This paper explores the global implications of AR, highlighting the interconnectedness of its drivers and consequences across diverse fields.  We examine the role of agricultural practices, where the widespread use of antibiotics in livestock contributes significantly to the development and dissemination of resistant strains.  Furthermore, we analyze the intricate interplay between environmental contamination, human behavior (e.g., antibiotic misuse and overuse), and the evolving genetic mechanisms underlying AR.  The research integrates insights from microbiology, epidemiology, veterinary science, environmental science, and public health policy to delineate the current landscape of AR.  Ultimately, we argue that effective mitigation strategies necessitate a holistic, interdisciplinary framework that transcends disciplinary boundaries and fosters international collaboration to combat this global crisis.
