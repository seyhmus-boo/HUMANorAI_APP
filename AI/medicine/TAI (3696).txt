Antibiotic resistance poses a global health crisis, threatening the efficacy of life-saving treatments. While traditionally addressed through epidemiological and chemical approaches, a quantum mechanical perspective offers novel insights into the underlying mechanisms and potential solutions. This presentation explores the application of quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics simulations to understand the interactions between antibiotics and their target proteins in resistant strains. We will discuss how subtle changes in electronic structure, bond lengths, and vibrational frequencies, often undetectable by classical methods, can significantly impact drug-target binding affinity and efficacy.  Furthermore, we will examine the potential for quantum computing to accelerate the *de novo* design of novel antibiotics, bypassing resistance mechanisms through optimized interactions at the atomic level.  By analyzing the quantum mechanical properties of antibiotic-protein complexes in both susceptible and resistant strains, we aim to highlight the potential of this approach to identify promising drug targets and guide the development of next-generation antibiotics.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the challenges and future directions of integrating quantum methodologies into the fight against antibiotic resistance, focusing on the need for high-performance computing and interdisciplinary collaboration.
