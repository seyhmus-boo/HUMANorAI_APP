This presentation explores emerging trends in adolescent mental health disorders through the lens of quantum-like models of cognition. While acknowledging the limitations of directly applying quantum mechanics to the brain, we propose that certain aspects of mental illness, particularly those characterized by instability and rapid shifts in emotional states, might be better understood using frameworks inspired by quantum theory.  We will review recent research indicating the potential relevance of quantum-like phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, in modeling cognitive processes underlying conditions like depression, anxiety, and bipolar disorder.  Specifically, we'll examine how these frameworks could potentially explain the seemingly paradoxical experiences of adolescents, including simultaneous contradictory thoughts and feelings, and rapid transitions between different emotional states.  Furthermore, we will discuss implications for treatment, highlighting how quantum-inspired computational models may offer novel avenues for personalized interventions.  Finally, we will address the challenges and future directions of this nascent field, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between physicists, psychologists, and clinicians to fully explore the potential of quantum-like approaches to understanding and treating adolescent mental health disorders.
