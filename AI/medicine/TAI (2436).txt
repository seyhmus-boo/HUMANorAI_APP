Antibiotic resistance (AR) poses a significant and escalating global health threat, undermining modern medicine's ability to treat bacterial infections.  Driven by factors including widespread antibiotic overuse and misuse in both human and veterinary medicine, and the inherent capacity of bacteria to evolve, AR leads to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.  The global implications are far-reaching, impacting vulnerable populations disproportionately and threatening progress in various sectors, including surgery, organ transplantation, and cancer treatment, where antibiotics are crucial for preventing infections.  

Practical applications aimed at mitigating AR include stringent antibiotic stewardship programs promoting judicious use, targeted antibiotic development focusing on novel mechanisms of action, and the exploration of alternative therapies such as phage therapy and antimicrobial peptides.  Improved infection prevention and control measures in healthcare settings are also crucial.  Furthermore, effective surveillance systems are needed to monitor resistance patterns and inform public health interventions.  Addressing AR necessitates a multifaceted, global approach encompassing policy changes, technological innovation, and public awareness campaigns to promote responsible antibiotic use and curb the rise of resistant strains.  Failure to act decisively will result in a return to a pre-antibiotic era with devastating consequences.
