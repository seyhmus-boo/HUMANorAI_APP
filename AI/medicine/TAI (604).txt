Adolescence, a period of significant physical, cognitive, and psychosocial development, is also a critical window of vulnerability for the onset of mental health disorders.  This paper examines the evolving trends in adolescent mental health, focusing on the prevalence, presentation, and co-occurrence of key disorders such as depression, anxiety, and substance abuse.  While diagnostic criteria remain relatively consistent,  shifting societal factors, including increased screen time, social media pressures, and economic instability, are hypothesized to influence both the incidence and manifestation of these disorders.  Furthermore, the paper will explore the efficacy and limitations of current treatment modalities, ranging from pharmacological interventions to evidence-based psychotherapies like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT).  A particular emphasis will be placed on the practical applications of research findings, including the development of targeted prevention programs, improved early intervention strategies, and the integration of technology-assisted treatments to enhance accessibility and engagement in care.  Ultimately, this review aims to contribute to the ongoing effort to improve mental healthcare outcomes for adolescents and to bridge the gap between research and clinical practice.
