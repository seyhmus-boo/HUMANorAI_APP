Cloud computing, initially conceived as a utility computing model, has undergone significant evolution since its inception. Early iterations focused primarily on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), offering virtualized computing resources on demand.  This foundational stage, characterized by limitations in scalability and management complexity, paved the way for subsequent advancements. The emergence of Platform as a Service (PaaS) provided developers with pre-configured environments, simplifying application deployment and management.  Simultaneously, Software as a Service (SaaS) gained prominence, offering fully managed applications accessible via the internet, significantly reducing the burden on end-users.  Recent developments have witnessed a convergence of these service models, fostering hybrid cloud architectures that leverage the strengths of both public and private clouds.  Furthermore, the integration of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and serverless computing has further propelled cloud computing's capabilities, enabling the development of sophisticated, scalable, and cost-effective solutions across various sectors.  This continuous evolution underscores cloud computing's pivotal role in modern technological infrastructure and its ongoing transformation of the digital landscape.
