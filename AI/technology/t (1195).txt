Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly expanding their application domains beyond entertainment, demonstrating significant potential across diverse sectors.  AR applications, overlaying computer-generated imagery onto the real world, are increasingly utilized in fields such as manufacturing (for interactive training and assembly guidance), healthcare (surgical planning and patient rehabilitation), and retail (virtual try-on experiences).  The integration of AR with mobile devices has broadened accessibility and fuelled innovation in user interfaces. Conversely, VR, which immerses users in entirely computer-generated environments, finds application in areas demanding high-fidelity simulation, including flight training, architectural visualization, and therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD.  However, challenges remain, including the cost of hardware and software development, the potential for motion sickness in VR applications, and concerns regarding data privacy and cybersecurity.  Future research should focus on enhancing user experience, addressing technological limitations, and investigating the ethical implications of widespread AR/VR adoption across diverse societal contexts.  Furthermore, interoperability between different AR/VR platforms and the development of robust, standardized content creation tools are crucial for fostering broader industry adoption and accelerating technological advancement.
