Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, while showing immense potential across various fields, face significant experimental challenges.  This abstract highlights key methodological limitations hindering robust scientific investigation.  Precise control over the experimental environment is often compromised in AR/VR studies, particularly concerning the influence of participant-specific factors like prior experience and individual differences in motion sickness susceptibility.  Standardization of hardware and software across experiments remains a major hurdle, limiting replicability and comparability of results.  Furthermore, ecological validity is a concern; immersive simulations may not accurately reflect real-world scenarios, potentially impacting the generalizability of findings.  The subjective nature of user experience necessitates sophisticated data collection techniques beyond simple questionnaires,  including physiological measurements and eye-tracking,  but these introduce complexities in data analysis and interpretation.  Future research must address these limitations through rigorous methodological design, employing standardized protocols, utilizing advanced data capture methods, and focusing on the development of robust experimental paradigms to advance our understanding of AR/VR's impact.
