This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), tracing their historical development and highlighting their contemporary significance.  Early conceptualizations of AI, dating back to the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, envisioned machines capable of human-level intelligence.  Initial optimism, however, gave way to periods of reduced funding and progress, known as "AI winters," due to limitations in computational power and algorithmic sophistication.

The resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributable to advancements in ML, particularly deep learning.  This presentation will explore key milestones, including the development of expert systems, the rise of neural networks, and the breakthroughs achieved through increased computational resources and the availability of massive datasets.  Specific examples will illustrate the applications of ML across diverse fields, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.  The ethical implications of increasingly sophisticated AI systems will also be briefly addressed, including concerns about bias, transparency, and the potential displacement of human labor.  Finally, the presentation will conclude by considering future directions and challenges in the ongoing evolution of AI and ML.
