Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture will briefly explore the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, conceptually dating back to Alan Turing's seminal work in the 1950s, encompasses the broader goal of creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, demonstrating limited success in complex, real-world scenarios.

Machine Learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data, adapting and improving their performance over time.  This paradigm shift, particularly accelerated by the rise of big data and computational power in recent decades, has fueled significant advancements in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.  While distinct, AI and ML are deeply interconnected; ML provides a crucial set of tools for achieving the overarching goals of AI, fostering a synergistic relationship that continues to shape technological progress.  We shall now delve into specific ML techniquesâ€¦
