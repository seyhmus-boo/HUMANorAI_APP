The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a paradigm shift in transportation, promising enhanced safety, efficiency, and accessibility. While the development of AVs is predominantly approached through classical engineering disciplines, this paper explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and this rapidly evolving field.  Although seemingly disparate, quantum phenomena offer potential avenues for enhancing various aspects of AV technology.  This research investigates the implications of quantum computing for real-time processing of sensor data, crucial for navigation and obstacle avoidance in complex environments. We examine the potential for quantum algorithms to surpass classical approaches in addressing the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional data streams generated by lidar, radar, and camera systems.  Furthermore, we delve into the potential applications of quantum sensing, specifically in enhancing the precision and robustness of positioning systems, thereby mitigating the limitations of GPS reliance. Finally, we discuss the long-term implications of quantum communication for secure inter-vehicle communication and the development of resilient infrastructure for autonomous driving.  This exploration lays the groundwork for future research on the pivotal role quantum mechanics may play in shaping the future of autonomous vehicle technology.
