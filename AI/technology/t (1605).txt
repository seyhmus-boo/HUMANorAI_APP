The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) presents significant experimental challenges across diverse disciplines.  Successfully navigating complex real-world scenarios necessitates overcoming limitations in sensor technology, particularly in adverse weather conditions like heavy rain or snow, where accurate object detection and classification become problematic.  Robustness against adversarial attacks, such as malicious interference with sensor data or software exploits, remains a crucial area of research, demanding the development of secure and verifiable systems.

Ethical dilemmas surrounding accident avoidance and decision-making algorithms pose substantial experimental hurdles. Defining acceptable risk levels and designing algorithms capable of consistently making morally justifiable decisions in unpredictable situations is an ongoing challenge.  Furthermore, the scalability of AV testing and validation presents significant logistical difficulties.  Replicating the sheer volume and diversity of real-world driving scenarios within a controlled environment, while ensuring meaningful data collection, is computationally expensive and requires innovative experimental designs.  Finally, the integration of AVs into existing traffic infrastructure and the development of effective human-machine interaction paradigms demand further interdisciplinary research and large-scale experimental trials.
