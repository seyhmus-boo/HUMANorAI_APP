Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly intertwined fields driving technological advancement.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. ML, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This learning process involves the identification of patterns and relationships within datasets, allowing algorithms to improve their performance on specific tasks over time.  Various ML techniques exist, including supervised learning (using labeled data), unsupervised learning (identifying patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error). The synergy between AI and ML is evident in applications ranging from natural language processing and computer vision to robotics and autonomous systems.  However, ethical considerations surrounding bias in algorithms, data privacy, and the potential for job displacement necessitate careful consideration as AI and ML technologies continue to evolve and permeate society.
