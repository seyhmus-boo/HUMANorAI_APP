The Internet of Things (IoT), a network of interconnected physical devices embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity, has significantly impacted the evolution of smart homes.  Early precursors to IoT in home automation emerged in the late 20th century with programmable thermostats and rudimentary security systems. However, the proliferation of low-cost microcontrollers, widespread broadband internet access, and the development of robust communication protocols like Zigbee and Z-Wave in the 21st century propelled the true rise of IoT-enabled smart homes.

Smart homes leverage IoT by connecting appliances, lighting, security systems, and entertainment devices to a central network, often managed through a smartphone application.  This allows for automated control, remote monitoring, and data collection, enabling functionalities such as energy optimization, enhanced security, and personalized comfort.  However, the integration of numerous devices raises concerns regarding data privacy, security vulnerabilities, and interoperability challenges. Future research needs to address these issues to fully realize the potential of IoT in creating truly intelligent and user-friendly living environments.
