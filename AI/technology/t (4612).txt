While seemingly disparate, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies possess subtle connections to the principles of quantum mechanics.  Although classical computation underpins current AR/VR hardware, the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena offers intriguing avenues for future development.  Consider the challenge of rendering photorealistic virtual environments:  the sheer computational complexity necessitates sophisticated algorithms mirroring the probabilistic wave function collapse inherent in quantum measurement.  Similarly,  ARâ€™s overlay of digital information onto the real world could benefit from quantum-enhanced sensors providing higher precision and sensitivity in capturing and processing real-time data, surpassing the limitations of classical detectors.  Quantum computing's potential for exponentially faster computation could revolutionise rendering speed and processing power, enabling far more immersive and interactive AR/VR experiences.  Furthermore, quantum entanglement could, theoretically, facilitate seamless integration between the digital and physical realms, creating hyper-realistic and truly interactive simulations that currently remain computationally infeasible.  While significant hurdles remain, exploring the intersection of quantum mechanics and AR/VR promises advancements far exceeding the capabilities of classical systems.
