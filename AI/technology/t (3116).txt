The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology promises a transformative impact on transportation, yet significant experimental challenges remain before widespread deployment becomes a reality.  This presentation will examine key hurdles in the development and testing of AVs, focusing on three critical areas. Firstly, robust perception in challenging environmental conditions, such as adverse weather or complex, dynamic scenes, remains a significant obstacle.  The limitations of current sensor technologies and the computational cost of real-time scene understanding will be discussed. Secondly, the development of safe and reliable decision-making algorithms capable of handling unpredictable human behavior poses a considerable challenge.  This includes ethical considerations embedded within decision frameworks, especially in unavoidable accident scenarios. Finally,  the complexities of large-scale real-world testing, encompassing data acquisition, validation, and verification of safety protocols, will be addressed.  We will argue that addressing these experimental challenges requires a multi-faceted approach incorporating advancements in sensor fusion, AI algorithms, robust simulation environments, and collaborative data sharing initiatives across the research community.  The presentation will conclude by outlining promising future research directions for overcoming these obstacles and accelerating the safe and responsible integration of AVs into our society.
