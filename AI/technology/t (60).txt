Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on cloud computing and its evolutionary trajectory.  Initially conceived as a utility-based model for distributing computing resources, cloud computing has undergone a significant metamorphosis.  Early iterations, primarily characterized by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), offered basic virtualized hardware.  This evolved into Platform as a Service (PaaS), providing developers with pre-configured environments for application deployment.  The current landscape is dominated by Software as a Service (SaaS), offering fully managed applications accessible via the internet.

This evolution has been driven by increasing demand for scalability, cost-efficiency, and accessibility.  Practical applications are ubiquitous.  From streaming services like Netflix leveraging IaaS for scalability to Salesforce CRM utilizing PaaS for application development and Google Docs epitomising SaaS for collaborative document editing, cloud computing permeates modern life.  Furthermore, advancements in areas like serverless computing and edge computing continue to refine the cloud paradigm, promising even greater efficiency and responsiveness in the future.  This transformative technology will continue to reshape our digital world.
