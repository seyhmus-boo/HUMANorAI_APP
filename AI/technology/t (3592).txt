Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  A crucial subset of AI is machine learning (ML), where systems learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on input data. This learning process can be supervised, using labelled data, unsupervised, identifying patterns in unlabelled data, or reinforcement-based, learning through trial and error.

The practical applications of AI and ML are vast and rapidly expanding. In healthcare, ML algorithms diagnose diseases from medical images with remarkable accuracy.  Financial institutions leverage AI for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on AI for object recognition and navigation.  Furthermore, AI powers personalized recommendations in e-commerce and enables sophisticated natural language processing in virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa.  The continued advancement of these technologies promises transformative impacts across numerous sectors.
