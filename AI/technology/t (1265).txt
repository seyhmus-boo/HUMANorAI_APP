The advent of quantum computing presents both unprecedented challenges and potential solutions to cybersecurity.  Current cryptographic systems, relying on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers (RSA) or discrete logarithm problems (ECC), are vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm capable of efficiently solving these problems. This renders widely used encryption methods obsolete, threatening data confidentiality and integrity on a global scale.  Furthermore, quantum annealing may accelerate brute-force attacks on symmetric key cryptography, although the extent of this threat remains a subject of ongoing research.

Addressing these challenges necessitates the development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), which encompasses algorithms resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers.  Lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, and multivariate cryptography are prominent candidates, leveraging the mathematical hardness of problems believed intractable even for quantum computers.  However, the transition to PQC is complex, requiring careful standardization, algorithm selection considering efficiency and security trade-offs, and widespread implementation across existing infrastructure.  Moreover, quantum key distribution (QKD), utilizing the principles of quantum mechanics to secure key exchange, offers a fundamentally secure alternative, though its scalability and practical implementation remain considerable hurdles.  Ultimately, a holistic approach, encompassing both algorithmic and physical security measures, is vital to ensure robust cybersecurity in the quantum era.
