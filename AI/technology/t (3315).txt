Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly evolving, transcending initial entertainment-focused deployments to encompass diverse sectors.  Recent developments in AR showcase a shift towards more sophisticated overlay technologies.  Improved markerless tracking and simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms facilitate seamless integration of digital content into the real world, enhancing applications in fields such as architecture (virtual walkthroughs of building designs), medical training (interactive anatomical models), and retail (virtual try-on experiences).  Meanwhile, VR has witnessed advancements in haptic feedback technology, providing users with a more immersive and realistic sense of touch. This enhancement is particularly impactful in areas like surgical simulation and rehabilitation therapy, where tactile interaction is crucial for effective training and treatment.  Furthermore, the increasing affordability and accessibility of VR headsets, coupled with the development of more powerful and portable processing units, are driving wider adoption across various sectors.  The convergence of AR and VR technologies, creating mixed reality (MR) experiences, represents another significant frontier, blurring the lines between the physical and digital worlds and promising innovative applications yet to be fully explored.
