The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a culmination of decades of research and development in various fields, including artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics.  Early conceptualizations date back to the 1920s, with rudimentary demonstrations of radio-controlled vehicles. However, significant advancements emerged in the latter half of the 20th century, fueled by progress in computing power and sensor technology.  The development of expert systems and early forms of machine learning during the 1970s and 80s laid the theoretical groundwork for autonomous navigation.  The 1990s saw increased government and academic investment in autonomous vehicle projects, often focusing on specific environments like off-road terrains or structured highway settings.  The 21st century has witnessed an exponential increase in both technological capabilities and commercial interest. This acceleration is largely attributed to breakthroughs in deep learning, enabling sophisticated object recognition and decision-making capabilities, as well as the proliferation of affordable, high-performance sensors like LiDAR and radar.  Consequently, major automotive manufacturers and technology companies are now heavily investing in AV development, marking a pivotal moment in the automotive industry's transition towards a potentially transformative technology with far-reaching societal implications.
