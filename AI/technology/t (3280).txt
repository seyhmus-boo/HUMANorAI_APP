Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, while distinct, share a common lineage rooted in early computer graphics research and the burgeoning field of human-computer interaction.  Early head-mounted displays, dating back to the 1960s, laid the groundwork for immersive VR experiences, initially focusing on simulation and military applications.  Simultaneously, research in computer vision paved the way for AR systems capable of overlaying digital information onto the real world.  This abstract explores the evolution and current applications of both technologies.  While early VR applications were primarily limited by processing power and display resolution, advancements in computing and sensor technology have enabled highly realistic and interactive experiences, finding use in gaming, training, and therapeutic interventions.  AR, benefiting from the proliferation of smartphones and wearable computing, has seen wider adoption in consumer applications like navigation and mobile gaming, while also demonstrating potential in industrial maintenance, medical visualization, and education.  This review highlights the convergence of these technologies, including advancements in mixed reality (MR), and their burgeoning influence across diverse fields, emphasizing the need for further research into user experience, ethical considerations, and the potential societal impact of increasingly immersive digital environments.
