This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), tracing their historical development and highlighting their current impact.  Early conceptualizations of AI, dating back to the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, envisioned machines capable of human-level intelligence.  Initial progress focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, but limitations in scalability and real-world applicability became apparent. The subsequent "AI winters" witnessed periods of reduced funding and enthusiasm.

The resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributed to advancements in ML, particularly deep learning.  The availability of massive datasets and increased computational power, coupled with algorithmic innovations, enabled breakthroughs in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics. This presentation will discuss key ML algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, outlining their respective strengths and weaknesses.  Finally, we will briefly address the ethical implications and societal impact of rapidly advancing AI and ML technologies, emphasizing the need for responsible development and deployment.  The presentation concludes by considering future directions and potential challenges in this rapidly evolving field.
