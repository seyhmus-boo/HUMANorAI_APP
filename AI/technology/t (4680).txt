Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation.  Its conceptual roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, marking a formal initiation of the field. Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, achieving limited success.

Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns and make predictions from data.  This shift, spurred by increased computing power and data availability, led to significant advancements.  Early ML techniques included decision trees and naive Bayes classifiers.  The subsequent development of neural networks, inspired by the structure of the human brain, revolutionized the field, enabling deep learning and breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and other domains.  While AI's scope is broader, encompassing areas like expert systems and robotics, ML provides the engine driving many contemporary AI applications.  The ongoing convergence of AI and ML continues to propel technological innovation across numerous sectors.
