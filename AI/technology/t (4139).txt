5G networks, while primarily operating within classical electromagnetic regimes, subtly interact with the quantum mechanical world, presenting both challenges and opportunities.  The high frequency and dense deployment of 5G infrastructure necessitate considerations of quantum noise, particularly in sensitive quantum technologies.  Increased signal density may introduce unwanted decoherence in quantum systems via electromagnetic interference, hindering the performance of quantum computing, sensing, and communication devices. Conversely,  5G's high bandwidth and low latency offer potential benefits for quantum key distribution (QKD) networks, facilitating faster and more secure quantum communication.  The miniaturization of components in 5G technology also necessitates investigation into quantum effects at nanoscales, influencing device reliability and signal propagation. This abstract argues for a more holistic approach in future 5G development, incorporating quantum mechanical principles to both mitigate potential negative impacts and leverage the synergistic potential between classical and quantum technologies. Future research should focus on quantifying the impact of 5G electromagnetic fields on various quantum systems and exploring innovative applications enabled by the convergence of these fields.
