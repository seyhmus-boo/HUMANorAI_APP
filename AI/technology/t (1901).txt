Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related technological advancements in human-computer interaction.  Historically, the conceptual foundations for both can be traced back to Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957), a pioneering immersive entertainment device.  However, significant development only occurred with the advent of powerful computing and display technologies.  VR, focusing on the creation of entirely simulated environments, initially saw application in military simulation and advanced visualization.  AR, conversely, overlays digital information onto the real world, finding early use in head-up displays for aviation.

Contemporary applications are far more diverse.  VR finds traction in gaming, architectural visualization, and therapeutic interventions, leveraging immersion to enhance engagement and understanding. AR, with its capacity for contextualized information delivery, is employed in retail (e.g., virtual try-ons), education (e.g., interactive learning modules), and industrial maintenance (e.g., real-time guidance overlays).  The convergence of both technologies, as seen in mixed reality systems, promises even more sophisticated applications, blurring the lines between the physical and digital realms and revolutionizing various aspects of human experience.
