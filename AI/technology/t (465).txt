This presentation explores the burgeoning intersection of big data analytics and quantum mechanics, focusing on the transformative role big data plays across modern industries. While seemingly disparate fields, the exponential growth of data necessitates computational approaches exceeding the capabilities of classical algorithms.  We argue that the inherent parallelism and potential for exponential speedup offered by quantum computing will be crucial in unlocking the full potential of big data analysis.  This presentation will examine specific industrial applications, including drug discovery, materials science, and financial modeling, where the complexity of data analysis currently hinders progress.  We will discuss how quantum machine learning algorithms, designed to operate on quantum computers, can effectively address challenges like feature extraction from high-dimensional datasets and optimization problems intractable for classical methods.  Furthermore, we will address the limitations of current quantum technologies and outline promising future directions for the development of hybrid classical-quantum approaches to big data analysis, focusing on the practical steps needed to bridge the gap between theoretical advancements and real-world industrial implementation.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the ethical implications of deploying such powerful analytical tools.
