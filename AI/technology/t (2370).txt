Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has rapidly evolved from its nascent stages to become a ubiquitous force shaping global digital infrastructure.  This paper examines the historical trajectory of cloud computing, tracing its origins and key developmental phases.  Early precursors, such as time-sharing systems and remote access computing in the 1960s and 70s, laid the groundwork for the distributed computing models that would eventually underpin cloud architecture.  The rise of the internet in the 1990s provided the crucial network backbone, enabling the development of scalable and on-demand services.  The pivotal moment arrived with the emergence of the commercial internet and the subsequent adoption of virtualization technologies in the early 2000s, facilitating the efficient sharing of resources.  This period witnessed the introduction of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), followed by Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), marking a transition from simple resource provision to comprehensive application delivery.  This research will analyze the technological advancements, market dynamics, and evolving security considerations that have driven the remarkable growth and diversification of cloud computing, culminating in its current omnipresence.
