Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture will briefly explore the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, in its broadest sense, encompasses the creation of intelligent agents, systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This is achieved through algorithms that identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time.

The distinction is crucial: AI sets the overarching goal of intelligent behaviour; ML provides a powerful methodology to achieve it.  ML algorithms power numerous practical applications.  In healthcare, ML aids in disease diagnosis and drug discovery.  Financial institutions leverage it for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on ML for object recognition and navigation.  Furthermore, recommendation systems used by online retailers and streaming services are driven by sophisticated ML models.  The rapid advancements in both AI and ML continue to reshape various sectors, promising both transformative opportunities and significant ethical considerations.
