Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications hold immense potential across diverse fields, yet their widespread adoption is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  This abstract highlights key obstacles encountered in evaluating the efficacy and usability of AR/VR systems.  Firstly, controlling for individual differences in user experience presents a considerable methodological hurdle.  Variability in technological literacy, spatial reasoning abilities, and susceptibility to cybersickness significantly impacts data interpretation and limits generalizability of findings. Secondly, creating ecologically valid experimental paradigms that accurately mirror real-world application scenarios is often difficult.  Overly simplified or artificial tasks may fail to capture the complexity of human-computer interaction within immersive environments.  Thirdly, the development of robust and reliable metrics for assessing the impact of AR/VR interventions remains an ongoing challenge.  Current measures often lack sensitivity or fail to capture the nuanced effects on cognitive, behavioral, and affective responses. Finally, ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, user safety, and potential biases embedded within AR/VR systems necessitate rigorous ethical review processes and the development of transparent methodological guidelines. Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing the scientific understanding and responsible implementation of AR/VR technologies.
