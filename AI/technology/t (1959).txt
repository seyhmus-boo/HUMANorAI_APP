Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, while distinct, share a common lineage in early computer graphics research.  Early conceptualizations, dating back to the mid-20th century, envisioned immersive digital environments, though technological limitations hampered their realization.  The development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) in the 1960s marked a crucial step, laying the foundation for both technologies.

VR, focusing on the creation of entirely simulated environments, has seen significant growth in gaming and entertainment, offering increasingly realistic experiences. However, challenges remain in addressing issues such as motion sickness and the high cost of development and hardware. AR, conversely, overlays digital information onto the real world, finding applications in fields ranging from medical training and industrial design to retail and tourism.  Its integration with mobile devices has broadened accessibility and spurred innovation.

Despite their different approaches, both AR and VR applications continue to evolve rapidly, fuelled by advances in computing power, sensor technology, and display capabilities.  Future advancements are likely to witness greater convergence, leading to more sophisticated hybrid experiences that blur the line between the physical and digital realms, with potential transformative impacts across various sectors.
