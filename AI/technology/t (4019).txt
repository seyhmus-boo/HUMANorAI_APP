This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications.  While current AR/VR technologies rely on classical computation, the inherent limitations of classical systems—particularly in processing power and data storage for highly complex simulations—suggest a future where quantum computing plays a crucial role.  We will examine potential applications of quantum algorithms in rendering photorealistic virtual environments, significantly improving computational efficiency in real-time rendering and physics simulations within AR/VR.  Furthermore, we will discuss the implications of quantum entanglement for creating more immersive and interactive experiences, enabling novel forms of user interaction and haptic feedback surpassing current technological capabilities.  The exploration of quantum-enhanced random number generation could also revolutionize the creation of procedural content, leading to unprecedented levels of detail and realism.  Challenges, including the development of quantum-compatible hardware and the need for quantum-resistant security protocols, will be addressed.  This presentation aims to stimulate discussion on the transformative potential of quantum mechanics in shaping the future of AR/VR technologies.
