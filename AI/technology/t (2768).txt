The burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are rapidly transforming human interaction with the digital world.  While traditionally considered domains of computer science and engineering, a deeper exploration reveals a potential for significant influence from quantum mechanics. This paper investigates the intersection of these seemingly disparate disciplines, focusing on how quantum mechanical principles might enhance and revolutionize AR/VR applications.  Currently, classical computing underpins AR/VR technologies, leading to limitations in processing power, display resolution, and data management, particularly in complex, immersive environments.  Quantum computing, with its potential for exponential speedups and improved data encoding, offers a compelling avenue to overcome these obstacles. We explore the potential of quantum algorithms for real-time rendering of high-fidelity 3D environments, improved sensor fusion for more accurate tracking and interaction in AR, and the development of more realistic and responsive virtual avatars.  Furthermore, we consider the implications of quantum communication for enhanced latency and bandwidth in distributed AR/VR systems, ultimately paving the way for truly seamless and immersive experiences.  This paper will analyze these opportunities while acknowledging the significant technological hurdles that remain before quantum-enhanced AR/VR becomes a reality.
