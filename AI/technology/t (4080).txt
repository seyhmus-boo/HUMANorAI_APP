Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the experimental hurdles hindering the advancement of quantum computing. While theoretical advancements are rapidly progressing, realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers faces significant challenges.  Qubit coherence, the crucial maintenance of superposition, remains exceptionally fragile, susceptible to decoherence from environmental noise.  Scaling up the number of qubits, while maintaining individual qubit control and connectivity, presents a formidable engineering problem.  Current fabrication techniques struggle to produce qubits with sufficient fidelity and scalability, leading to high error rates in computation. Furthermore, developing robust quantum error correction codes and implementing them experimentally is a complex undertaking, requiring intricate control protocols and significant overhead.  Overcoming these challenges necessitates interdisciplinary collaborations encompassing materials science, nanotechnology, and control engineering.  Only through innovative solutions in these areas can we hope to unlock the transformative potential of quantum computing.
