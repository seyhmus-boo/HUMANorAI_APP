The advent of quantum computing presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges to the field of cybersecurity.  While classical cryptographic methods underpinning much of modern data security are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers, the inherent properties of quantum mechanics also offer pathways to fundamentally more secure systems. This research paper explores the intersection of quantum mechanics and cybersecurity, examining the evolving landscape of threats and the development of quantum-resistant solutions.  We analyze the vulnerabilities posed by Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm to widely used public-key cryptosystems and hash functions, highlighting the imminent need for a paradigm shift in cryptographic practices.  Furthermore, we investigate the potential of quantum key distribution (QKD) and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as robust alternatives.  This analysis will delve into the practical limitations and theoretical advancements within QKD, including its susceptibility to side-channel attacks and the scalability challenges associated with its implementation.  Finally, we discuss the diverse approaches within PQC, such as lattice-based, code-based, and multivariate cryptography, assessing their resilience against both classical and quantum attacks and their suitability for various applications.
