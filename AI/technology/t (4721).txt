Good morning. Today's lecture addresses experimental challenges in the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  While AI encompasses broader intelligent systems, our focus is on ML's reliance on empirical data for model training and evaluation.  A significant challenge lies in data bias, where skewed datasets lead to biased models, perpetuating and even amplifying societal prejudices.  Furthermore, achieving generalizability remains elusive.  Models trained on one dataset often fail to perform well on unseen data, hindering their real-world application.  The "black box" nature of many deep learning models presents another obstacle; understanding their decision-making processes is crucial for accountability and trust, yet remains largely opaque.  Finally, resource constraints – computational power and extensive datasets – significantly limit research, particularly in resource-limited settings, creating a disparity in AI development and application.  Overcoming these challenges is critical for responsible and effective AI development.
