The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) mirrors several historical technological transitions.  Like the shift from manual to automated manufacturing, AVs represent a move from human-intensive, error-prone systems to automated, potentially more efficient ones.  Consider the printing press: its introduction dramatically increased the accessibility and speed of information dissemination, much as AVs promise to revolutionize transportation.  However, initial adoption was gradual, encountering resistance and requiring significant infrastructure development (like the creation of standardized paper sizes).  Similarly, widespread AV adoption necessitates substantial investment in supporting infrastructure, including high-definition mapping, robust communication networks (5G and beyond), and legal frameworks addressing liability and safety.  The transition isn't simply technological; itâ€™s socio-economic, mirroring the agricultural revolution where mechanization displaced human labor, demanding adaptation and retraining.  Just as the internal combustion engine didn't immediately replace horses, AVs will likely coexist with human-driven vehicles for a considerable period, gradually increasing their market share as technological advancements and public confidence build.
