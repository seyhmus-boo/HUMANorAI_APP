Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Machine learning (ML), a subfield of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  ML algorithms identify patterns and build predictive models from input data, iteratively improving their accuracy through feedback mechanisms.  This learning process can be supervised, using labeled data to guide model training, unsupervised, identifying patterns in unlabeled data, or reinforcement-based, where an agent learns through trial and error within an environment.

The practical applications of AI and ML are pervasive.  In healthcare, ML algorithms analyze medical images for disease detection, predict patient outcomes, and personalize treatment plans.  Finance utilizes AI for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment.  Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on AI for navigation and obstacle avoidance.  Furthermore, natural language processing (NLP), a crucial AI component, powers chatbots, language translation tools, and sentiment analysis systems.  The continued advancement of AI and ML promises to revolutionize numerous sectors, albeit with concomitant ethical considerations requiring careful attention.
