This presentation addresses the experimental challenges inherent in researching Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications.  While AR/VR technologies offer transformative potential across numerous domains, rigorous experimental design and data collection present unique hurdles.  We will focus on three key areas: (1)  **Ecological Validity:**  Replicating real-world scenarios within controlled experimental settings remains a significant challenge, impacting the generalizability of findings.  The artificiality of many VR environments and the limitations of current AR overlays compromise the naturalism necessary for meaningful behavioral studies. (2) **Participant Experience and Bias:**  Motion sickness, cybersickness, and the novelty effect can significantly influence participant responses, confounding the interpretation of experimental data.  Addressing these biases requires sophisticated counterbalancing techniques and careful consideration of participant selection criteria. (3) **Data Acquisition and Analysis:**  The richness of data generated by AR/VR systems – including physiological measures, eye-tracking data, and behavioral interactions – necessitates robust and adaptable analytical frameworks.  Developing standardized methods for data acquisition and processing is crucial for facilitating cross-study comparisons and advancing the field.  The presentation will conclude by proposing potential solutions and outlining future research directions aimed at overcoming these experimental challenges to ensure the robust and reliable evaluation of AR/VR applications.
