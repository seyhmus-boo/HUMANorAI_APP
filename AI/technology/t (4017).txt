Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct but related approaches to integrating digital information with the user's perception of reality.  AR, analogous to adding digital annotations to a physical map, overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real world, enhancing it with supplementary information. Think of a smartphone app displaying furniture placement possibilities within your living room, superimposed onto the live camera feed â€“ the room remains real, but the digital furniture adds context and facilitates decision-making.  Conversely, VR, akin to stepping into a fully immersive diorama, creates entirely simulated environments.  Imagine wearing a headset that transports you to a historical battlefield; all sensory input, from visual landscapes to simulated sounds, is digitally fabricated, offering an entirely artificial yet potentially highly realistic experience. While distinct, both AR and VR find applications in various fields, ranging from interactive training simulations (VR) for surgeons practicing complex procedures, to enhanced navigation systems (AR) utilizing real-time traffic data overlaid on a driver's view. The key differentiator lies in their respective approaches: AR augments the real world, whereas VR replaces it altogether.
