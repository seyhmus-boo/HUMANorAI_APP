This lecture examines the evolving landscape of cybersecurity challenges and corresponding mitigation strategies.  The proliferation of interconnected devices within the Internet of Things (IoT) significantly expands the attack surface, rendering traditional perimeter-based security inadequate.  Furthermore, the sophistication of advanced persistent threats (APTs), employing techniques such as polymorphic malware and zero-day exploits, necessitates a multi-layered defence approach.  Data breaches, driven by both financially motivated actors and state-sponsored espionage, pose significant risks to individual privacy and organizational integrity.

Addressing these challenges requires a holistic strategy.  This includes robust authentication and authorization mechanisms, employing advanced endpoint detection and response (EDR) systems, and fostering a security-aware culture through comprehensive employee training.  Implementation of robust data loss prevention (DLP) measures, coupled with proactive threat intelligence gathering and incident response planning, are crucial.  Furthermore, the adoption of  blockchain technology and decentralized architectures offers potential for enhanced security and resilience in certain contexts. Continuous monitoring and adaptation are paramount, given the dynamic nature of the cyber threat environment.
