Cloud computing has revolutionized information technology, yet its ongoing evolution presents significant experimental challenges. This presentation explores the key experimental hurdles in studying and advancing cloud technologies.  We examine the limitations of traditional simulation approaches in capturing the dynamic and complex nature of large-scale cloud environments, highlighting the need for more sophisticated modelling techniques incorporating real-world variability and heterogeneity.  The inherent scalability of cloud systems poses difficulties in designing and executing controlled experiments, often leading to issues with reproducibility and generalizability of findings.  Further complexities arise from the distributed and multi-tenant nature of cloud resources, requiring innovative experimental methodologies to isolate effects and mitigate interference.  We discuss emerging approaches, such as controlled cloud testbeds and the use of advanced monitoring and analysis tools, to address these challenges.  Finally, the presentation will outline future research directions necessary to overcome these experimental bottlenecks and enable more robust and reliable evaluation of novel cloud architectures and services.  This includes exploring the ethical and societal implications of large-scale experimentation in cloud environments.
