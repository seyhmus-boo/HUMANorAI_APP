The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted the development of smart homes, transforming residences into interconnected ecosystems of intelligent devices.  This review examines the practical applications of IoT within the domestic sphere.  Smart home technology offers enhanced convenience and efficiency through automated systems managing lighting, temperature, and security.  For instance, smart thermostats learn user preferences to optimize energy consumption, while automated lighting systems enhance security and ambiance.  Further applications include integrated entertainment systems, remotely controlled appliances, and sophisticated security systems incorporating motion sensors and video surveillance.  These features contribute to improved energy efficiency, enhanced security, and increased convenience for residents.  However,  challenges remain, including data privacy concerns, the potential for cyberattacks, and the initial investment costs associated with implementing such systems.  Future research should focus on addressing these challenges to fully realize the transformative potential of IoT in the smart home environment.  Overall, the integration of IoT into homes presents a compelling paradigm shift in domestic living, offering tangible benefits despite inherent complexities.
