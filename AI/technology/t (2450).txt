Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating systems capable of intelligent behavior, has its roots in the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, widely considered its foundational event.  Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, aiming to encode human knowledge into rule-based programs. However, these approaches struggled with the complexity of real-world problems.  Machine learning, a subfield of AI, emerged as a more data-driven alternative.  Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns and make predictions from data through statistical methods.  This paradigm shift, fueled by increasing computational power and the availability of large datasets, led to significant breakthroughs in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.  While early ML techniques like decision trees and naive Bayes were relatively simple, the development of sophisticated algorithms such as support vector machines, neural networks, and deep learning architectures has revolutionized the field, enabling the creation of systems capable of achieving superhuman performance in specific tasks.  The ongoing interplay between AI and ML continues to push the boundaries of computational intelligence, driving innovation across diverse sectors.
