This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), highlighting its increasingly significant interdisciplinary connections.  While traditionally rooted in computer science, the transformative power of AI/ML necessitates collaboration across diverse academic domains. We will examine key interdisciplinary links, including:  the application of ML algorithms in the biological sciences for drug discovery and genomic analysis; the use of AI in social sciences to model complex social phenomena and predict human behavior; and the integration of AI in the humanities for text analysis, historical research, and the creation of new artistic forms.  Furthermore, we will discuss ethical considerations arising from these interdisciplinary collaborations, emphasizing the need for responsible AI development and deployment across all sectors.  The presentation will conclude by outlining future research directions emphasizing the critical role of interdisciplinary teams in addressing the challenges and harnessing the potential of AI/ML to solve complex real-world problems and foster innovation across fields.
