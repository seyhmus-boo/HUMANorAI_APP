Big data's transformative impact across modern industries is undeniable, promising enhanced efficiency, predictive capabilities, and novel business models.  However, harnessing its full potential presents significant experimental challenges that hinder the reliable translation of theoretical advancements into practical applications. This paper investigates these crucial experimental limitations within the context of big data's industrial deployment.  Specifically, we focus on the difficulties associated with data acquisition, preprocessing, and analysis in diverse industrial settings.  The heterogeneity of data sources, often involving disparate formats and varying levels of quality, poses a considerable obstacle to effective data integration and subsequent modelling.  Furthermore, the sheer volume and velocity of big data necessitate the development and deployment of robust and scalable computational infrastructures, a challenge compounded by issues of accessibility and computational cost.  Finally, ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, security, and potential bias in algorithmic outputs are inextricably linked to the experimental process and require careful attention.  This paper will examine these core experimental challenges, offering a critical analysis of existing methodologies and highlighting potential avenues for future research to overcome these limitations and unlock the full potential of big data in industry.
