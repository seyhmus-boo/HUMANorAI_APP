Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  ML algorithms identify patterns and build models from input data, iteratively improving their performance through feedback.  This contrasts with traditional programming, which relies on pre-defined rules.

AI's broader scope includes areas beyond ML, such as expert systems and natural language processing.  However, ML's ability to extract insights from large datasets has driven significant advancements across diverse applications.  Practical examples include image recognition in medical diagnosis, enabling automated detection of anomalies; natural language processing powering chatbots and language translation; and predictive modelling for financial forecasting and fraud detection.  The continuous development and refinement of ML algorithms are pushing the boundaries of AI's capabilities, leading to transformative impacts across numerous sectors.
