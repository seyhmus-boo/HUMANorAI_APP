Good morning. Today's lecture will explore the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and their diverse applications.  Recent developments signify a move beyond rudimentary gaming applications towards sophisticated, industry-integrated solutions.

In AR, advancements in computer vision and sensor technology facilitate increasingly seamless overlays of digital information onto the real world.  We see this manifested in improved navigation systems, interactive product visualizations in retail, and even medical applications like surgical planning and remote patient monitoring.  The miniaturisation of AR hardware, exemplified by the rise of AR glasses, promises further integration into everyday life.

VR, meanwhile, is witnessing significant progress in haptic feedback technology, rendering increasingly realistic and immersive experiences. This has broadened applications beyond entertainment, impacting areas such as architectural design, engineering simulations, and therapeutic interventions for PTSD and phobias.  The development of more affordable and user-friendly VR headsets is also driving wider adoption across various sectors.  The convergence of AR and VR, resulting in mixed reality environments, represents a particularly promising avenue for future research and innovation.
