Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subfield, machine learning (ML), face significant experimental challenges despite rapid advancements.  One primary hurdle lies in data acquisition and quality.  ML models are data-hungry, requiring vast, clean, and representative datasets for effective training.  Obtaining such datasets is often expensive, time-consuming, and prone to biases which propagate into the model, leading to unfair or inaccurate predictions.  Furthermore, the "black box" nature of many complex ML models presents interpretability challenges. Understanding *why* a model arrives at a specific prediction is crucial for validation, debugging, and building trust, yet many deep learning architectures lack transparency, hindering rigorous experimental evaluation.  Finally, generalizability remains a key obstacle. Models trained on one dataset often perform poorly on different, even closely related, datasets, limiting their real-world applicability.  Overcoming these data-centric, interpretational, and generalizability challenges is vital for advancing the field and ensuring responsible AI development.
