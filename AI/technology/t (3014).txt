The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a paradigm shift in transportation comparable to the transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles.  This presentation explores the multifaceted development of AV technology, drawing analogies to illustrate key advancements.  Just as the internal combustion engine revolutionized personal mobility, the convergence of artificial intelligence, sensor technology, and high-precision mapping is powering the AV revolution.  We will examine the development of AV perception, comparing it to the human visual and auditory systems;  the complex decision-making algorithms are analogous to the human brain's processing of sensory input to generate appropriate actions.  However, unlike human drivers, AVs rely on extensive datasets for training, akin to a student learning through rote memorization and experience. We will further discuss the challenges inherent in this technological leap, comparing the complexities of achieving reliable AV navigation in unpredictable environments to teaching a child to ride a bicycle safely in a busy city.  Finally, we will explore the societal implications, likening the potential disruption to the transformative effects of the internet on global communication.  This presentation will provide a high-level overview of this rapidly evolving field, highlighting both the promises and the pitfalls of this transformative technology.
