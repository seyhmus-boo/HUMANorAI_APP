Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrency, presents a distributed ledger system offering enhanced security, transparency, and immutability.  This review examines the core principles of blockchain, focusing on its cryptographic underpinnings and consensus mechanisms.  Applications beyond cryptocurrency are explored, demonstrating its versatility across diverse sectors.  Supply chain management benefits from improved traceability and fraud reduction, while healthcare sees potential in secure data storage and interoperability.  Furthermore, digital identity management leverages blockchain's inherent security to create verifiable credentials.  However, scalability challenges, regulatory uncertainties, and energy consumption concerns remain significant limitations.  While the potential for transformative applications is substantial, further research is required to address these hurdles and realize the full potential of blockchain technology.  This review concludes that blockchain's impact will depend on effective integration with existing infrastructure and the development of robust, efficient, and environmentally conscious protocols.
