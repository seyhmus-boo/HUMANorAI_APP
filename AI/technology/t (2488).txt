Good morning. Today's lecture will address the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the creation of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming. Recent developments have seen remarkable progress in both fields.

Deep learning, a powerful ML technique utilizing artificial neural networks with multiple layers, has driven significant advancements.  This has manifested in breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing, exemplified by AlphaGo's victory over a world champion Go player.  Furthermore, the rise of large language models, trained on massive datasets, has yielded impressive capabilities in text generation, translation, and question answering.  However, challenges remain, including addressing biases embedded in training data and ensuring the ethical and responsible deployment of these increasingly powerful technologies.  Further research is crucial to mitigate these risks and unlock the full potential of AI and ML.
