Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly advancing, promising transformative applications across diverse sectors.  However, the realization of their full potential is significantly hampered by a range of experimental challenges. This paper examines these critical limitations, focusing on the inherent difficulties in conducting rigorous and reproducible research within the AR/VR landscape.  The unique characteristics of these immersive technologies present methodological hurdles not encountered in traditional experimental paradigms.  Issues such as participant simulator sickness, the standardization of hardware and software across studies, and the complex interplay between technological features and user experience significantly impact data validity and generalizability.  Furthermore, the subjective nature of immersion and the difficulty in controlling extraneous variables within simulated environments necessitate careful consideration of experimental design and data analysis techniques.  This paper will explore these challenges, highlighting prevalent methodologies and suggesting potential avenues for improving the rigor and reproducibility of AR/VR research, thereby paving the way for more robust and reliable conclusions about the efficacy and impact of these emerging technologies.
