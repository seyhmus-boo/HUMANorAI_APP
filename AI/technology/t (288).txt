Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined as the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, boasts a history dating back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, where the term was coined. Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, aiming to program explicit rules to solve problems.  However, these approaches struggled with the complexity of real-world scenarios.  The subsequent shift towards ML, a subfield of AI, offered a more data-driven approach. ML algorithms learn patterns and make predictions from data without explicit programming, leveraging statistical methods and optimization techniques.  This paradigm shift, fueled by the exponential growth of computing power and data availability, led to significant advancements in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.  While early ML models were relatively simple, the development of deep learning – employing artificial neural networks with multiple layers – has propelled the field forward, enabling the achievement of previously unattainable levels of accuracy and performance in diverse applications.  The interplay between AI's overarching goals and ML's powerful techniques continues to drive innovation across numerous scientific and industrial sectors.
