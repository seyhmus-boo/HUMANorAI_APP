This presentation addresses the experimental challenges inherent in evaluating Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications.  While AR and VR technologies offer transformative potential across diverse fields, rigorous empirical investigation remains hampered by several key limitations.  Firstly, the inherent subjectivity of user experience necessitates sophisticated methodologies beyond simple questionnaires.  We discuss the need for integrating physiological measures (e.g., eye-tracking, galvanic skin response) to complement subjective reports and obtain a more comprehensive understanding of user engagement and immersion.  Secondly, the development of standardized experimental paradigms remains a crucial challenge.  The diversity of hardware and software platforms necessitates careful consideration of cross-platform compatibility and the potential for platform-specific biases in experimental findings.  Finally, ecological validity poses a significant hurdle.  Many current AR/VR experiments are conducted in controlled laboratory settings, raising questions about the generalizability of findings to real-world applications.  This presentation will explore these challenges through examples from our own research and propose potential solutions, including the development of standardized testing protocols and the incorporation of more ecologically valid experimental designs.  We argue that addressing these methodological shortcomings is critical to advancing the field and ensuring the responsible development and deployment of AR and VR technologies.
