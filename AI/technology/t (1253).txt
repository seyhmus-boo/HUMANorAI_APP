This presentation explores the evolution of cloud computing and the persistent experimental challenges hindering its full potential.  From early grid computing initiatives to the current multi-cloud and serverless architectures, the field has undergone a dramatic transformation, driven by advancements in virtualization, networking, and data management.  However, several experimental challenges remain.  Reproducibility of experiments across diverse cloud platforms, a major hurdle, stems from inherent platform heterogeneity and the lack of standardized benchmarking methodologies.  Furthermore, ensuring data integrity and security in distributed environments requires sophisticated experimental designs to address issues of data provenance and unauthorized access.  The dynamic nature of cloud resources poses significant challenges for performance evaluation, particularly in the context of resource provisioning and autoscaling.  Finally, the environmental impact of large-scale cloud deployments necessitates innovative experimental approaches to measure and mitigate energy consumption. This presentation will review these key challenges, discuss ongoing research efforts aiming to address them, and outline future directions for experimental investigation in cloud computing.
