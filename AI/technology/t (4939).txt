This presentation offers a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), employing accessible analogies to illuminate complex concepts.  AI, in its broadest sense, can be likened to a human chef: it aims to solve problems and achieve goals, but its approach varies.  ML, a subset of AI, is akin to teaching that chef a specific recipe. Instead of explicitly programming every step, we provide the chef (the algorithm) with data (ingredients and cooking instructions) and let it learn optimal cooking methods (patterns) through experience (training).  Different ML techniques, such as supervised learning (the chef follows a detailed recipe), unsupervised learning (the chef experiments to find the best flavour combinations), and reinforcement learning (the chef learns through trial and error, guided by customer feedback), represent diverse approaches to this "recipe learning".  The presentation will further explore the potential of AI and ML across diverse domains, highlighting both the transformative possibilities and the inherent limitations, using further illustrative analogies to elucidate crucial concepts like overfitting (a chef meticulously following a recipe for one type of dish but failing with others) and bias (a chef using only certain ingredients due to personal preference).  Finally, we will briefly address ethical considerations arising from the increasing deployment of these powerful technologies.
