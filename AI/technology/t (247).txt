Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science. AI encompasses the broader goal of creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computer systems to learn from and make predictions on data without explicit programming. This learning process involves identifying patterns, building models, and refining these models based on new data inputs.  The efficacy of ML algorithms hinges on the quality and quantity of the training data, and various techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, are employed depending on the nature of the data and the desired outcome.  Practical applications of AI and ML are ubiquitous, impacting diverse sectors.  In healthcare, ML algorithms diagnose diseases from medical images with increasing accuracy, while in finance, they predict market trends and detect fraudulent transactions.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on AI for navigation and obstacle avoidance, and personalized recommendations in e-commerce are powered by sophisticated ML models that analyze user preferences.  The continued advancement of these technologies promises even greater transformative potential across numerous fields.
