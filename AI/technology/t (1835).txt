Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning fields of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) and their practical applications.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception.  Examples include heads-up displays in automobiles providing navigation data, or mobile phone applications that superimpose product information onto physical objects using image recognition.  These technologies are transforming retail, allowing for virtual try-ons and immersive product demonstrations.

VR, conversely, immerses users in entirely simulated environments.  Applications span diverse sectors. In medicine, VR facilitates surgical training through realistic simulations, minimizing risk to patients.  In engineering,  VR enables design visualization and collaboration, streamlining complex projects.  Furthermore, VR is gaining traction in entertainment, with immersive gaming experiences offering unparalleled levels of engagement.  The continued development of both AR and VR promises to further revolutionize numerous aspects of human interaction and experience.  The ethical considerations inherent in such powerful technologies, however, must remain a central focus of ongoing research.
