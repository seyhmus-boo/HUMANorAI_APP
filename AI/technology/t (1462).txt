Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources, particularly data storage and computing power, has undergone a significant evolution.  Its conceptual roots lie in the time-sharing systems of the 1960s, which provided early forms of resource pooling.  However, the true genesis of modern cloud computing can be traced to the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the rise of the internet and the development of virtualization technologies.  These advancements enabled the efficient allocation and scaling of resources, paving the way for the emergence of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) models.

Initially dominated by large corporations offering dedicated solutions, the cloud computing landscape rapidly diversified.  The advent of open-source technologies and increased bandwidth further fuelled its expansion. Today, the field is characterized by a multitude of providers catering to diverse needs, from individual users to multinational enterprises, and continues to evolve with advancements in areas such as serverless computing and edge computing, promising greater efficiency and accessibility in the years to come.
