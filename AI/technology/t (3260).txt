Cybersecurity continues to present significant challenges in the contemporary digital landscape. This lecture examines prevalent threats, including advanced persistent threats (APTs), ransomware attacks, and increasingly sophisticated phishing campaigns targeting both individuals and organizations. The expanding attack surface, driven by the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud adoption, exacerbates vulnerabilities.  Data breaches, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage, underscore the urgency of robust security measures.  This presentation explores a multi-faceted approach to mitigation, emphasizing the importance of layered security architectures incorporating firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and robust endpoint protection.  Furthermore, the crucial role of employee training in bolstering human-centric security measures, including phishing awareness and secure password management, is highlighted.  Finally,  proactive measures such as regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and the adoption of zero-trust security models are presented as vital components of a comprehensive cybersecurity strategy to effectively navigate the evolving threat landscape.
