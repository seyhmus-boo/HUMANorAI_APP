Quantum computing holds immense promise but faces significant experimental hurdles before realizing its full potential.  This abstract highlights key challenges impeding the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.  Maintaining coherence times remains a critical obstacle, as environmental noise rapidly decoheres delicate quantum superpositions.  Scaling qubit numbers while preserving high fidelity control and minimizing crosstalk presents a formidable engineering challenge.  Developing robust, scalable quantum error correction codes is crucial for mitigating decoherence and gate errors, yet their implementation requires a significant increase in qubit count and control complexity. Furthermore, the development of efficient and scalable quantum algorithms tailored to address real-world problems is a critical, ongoing area of research.  Advancements in materials science, cryogenics, and control electronics are necessary to overcome these limitations.  Overcoming these experimental challenges requires concerted interdisciplinary efforts, encompassing novel qubit designs, improved fabrication techniques, and innovative error mitigation strategies, to pave the way for practical, large-scale quantum computers.
