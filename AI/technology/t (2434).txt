Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration across diverse fields.  This abstract explores the burgeoning applications of AR and VR, highlighting their synergistic potential and interdisciplinary links.  Computer science underpins the technological foundation, encompassing areas like 3D graphics rendering, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence for realistic simulations and intuitive interfaces.  Psychology contributes to understanding user experience, immersion, and the cognitive effects of extended realities, informing the design of engaging and effective applications.  Furthermore, medicine benefits from AR/VR in surgical planning, rehabilitation, and phobia treatment, while engineering leverages these technologies for design visualization and training simulations.  Education adopts AR/VR for immersive learning environments, enhancing knowledge retention and engagement.  Finally, the arts and humanities utilize these technologies for creative expression, museum exhibits, and historical reconstruction, demonstrating the broad impact of AR/VR across diverse domains.  Future research should focus on addressing challenges related to accessibility, affordability, and ethical considerations to fully realize the transformative potential of AR/VR across disciplines.
