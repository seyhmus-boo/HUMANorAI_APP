The future of quantum computing hinges critically on overcoming significant experimental challenges.  While theoretical advancements continue to expand the potential applications, realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers remains a formidable task.  Maintaining quantum coherence, the delicate superposition and entanglement crucial for computation, is hampered by environmental noise.  Developing robust quantum error correction codes and implementing them efficiently is paramount, but requires scaling up the number of qubits significantly, demanding advancements in fabrication and control techniques.

Furthermore, qubit scalability presents a major hurdle.  Current approaches, including superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and photonic systems, each face unique limitations in achieving the millions or billions of qubits necessary for practical computation.  These limitations stem from fabrication complexities, individual qubit control challenges, and the need for efficient qubit connectivity within a scalable architecture.  Finally, the development of fault-tolerant quantum algorithms and efficient compilers to map them onto the physical hardware remains an active area of research.  Overcoming these intertwined experimental barriers is crucial for transitioning from proof-of-concept demonstrations to large-scale, practically useful quantum computers.
