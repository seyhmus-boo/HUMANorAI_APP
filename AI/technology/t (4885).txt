This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on their practical applications across diverse sectors.  We will begin by defining key concepts, differentiating between AI's broad scope and ML's focus on algorithmic learning from data.  The presentation will then explore prominent ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, illustrating their strengths and limitations through relevant examples.  Practical applications will be highlighted, showcasing the transformative impact of AI/ML in healthcare (e.g., disease diagnosis, drug discovery), finance (e.g., fraud detection, algorithmic trading), and transportation (e.g., autonomous vehicles, traffic optimization).  We will discuss the ethical considerations inherent in deploying AI/ML systems, emphasizing the importance of bias mitigation and responsible development. Finally, the presentation will briefly address future trends and challenges in the field, including the potential for explainable AI and the ongoing pursuit of artificial general intelligence.  The aim is to provide attendees with a foundational understanding of AI/ML's capabilities and its burgeoning influence on society.
