Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the applications of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).  While seemingly novel, their conceptual roots stretch back to the mid-20th century, with Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) representing an early, albeit rudimentary, VR prototype.  Ivan Sutherland's "The Ultimate Display" (1968) further solidified the theoretical framework for immersive digital environments.  However, technological limitations significantly constrained early development.

The advent of more powerful computing and improved display technologies propelled AR and VR into the mainstream.  Contemporary AR applications, such as Pok√©mon Go and various filter-based social media tools, illustrate the technology's capacity for overlaying digital information onto the real world, enhancing user experience and interaction.  Conversely, VR, exemplified by gaming headsets and architectural simulations, creates fully immersive artificial environments.  Applications span diverse fields, including medicine (surgical training), engineering (design visualization), and entertainment, demonstrating their transformative potential across numerous sectors.  Further research into user interface design and haptic feedback remains crucial for optimizing their impact and accessibility.
