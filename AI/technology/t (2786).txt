This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in contemporary cybersecurity research.  While theoretical frameworks abound, translating these into robust, empirically validated solutions remains a significant hurdle. We highlight three key experimental challenges: (1) the difficulty in creating realistic, yet ethical, attack simulations; the inherent limitations of controlled environments often fail to capture the complexity and dynamism of real-world cyber threats. (2) the scarcity of publicly available, high-quality datasets for training and evaluating security algorithms;  data limitations hinder the development of generalized and robust models capable of handling novel attacks. (3) the challenge of accurately measuring the effectiveness of security interventions;  lack of standardized metrics and evaluation methodologies impedes comparative analysis and hinders progress in the field.  This presentation will discuss innovative approaches to addressing these challenges, including the use of synthetic data generation techniques, adversarial machine learning methods, and the development of more comprehensive evaluation frameworks.  We will argue that overcoming these experimental limitations is crucial for advancing cybersecurity research and for building more resilient and effective security systems.
