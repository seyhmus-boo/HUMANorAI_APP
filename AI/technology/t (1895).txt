The burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) necessitate a highly interdisciplinary approach for successful application development and implementation.  Their impact spans numerous sectors, demanding expertise from diverse disciplines.  Computer science forms the foundational layer, encompassing software engineering for immersive environments, 3D modelling, and real-time rendering.  Human-computer interaction (HCI) is crucial for designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, considering factors like ergonomics and accessibility.  Psychology contributes to the understanding of user experience, cognitive load, and the potential impact on perception and behaviour within virtual and augmented environments.  Furthermore, design thinking methodologies are essential for translating technological capabilities into meaningful and aesthetically pleasing experiences.  Applications in healthcare, for instance, leverage medical imaging and physiological data analysis alongside VR/AR to enhance surgical training and patient rehabilitation.  Similarly, engineering integrates with AR for improved maintenance processes and design visualization, while educational applications necessitate pedagogical expertise to maximize learning outcomes. This collaborative effort underscores the inherently interdisciplinary nature of AR/VR technology and its transformative potential across various sectors.
