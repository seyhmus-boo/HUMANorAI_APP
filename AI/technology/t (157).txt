This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on their practical applications across diverse sectors.  We will begin by differentiating AI and ML, clarifying the relationship between these increasingly intertwined fields and exploring core concepts such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.  The discussion will then transition to a review of real-world applications, highlighting successful deployments. Examples will include the utilization of ML algorithms in medical diagnosis (e.g., image analysis for early cancer detection), financial modeling (e.g., fraud detection and algorithmic trading), and personalized recommendations in e-commerce.  Furthermore, we will touch upon the ethical considerations and societal implications arising from the widespread adoption of AI and ML technologies, emphasizing the importance of responsible development and deployment.  The presentation concludes with a brief exploration of future trends and potential research directions within these rapidly evolving domains.
