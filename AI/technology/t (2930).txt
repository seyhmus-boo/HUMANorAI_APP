Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, broadly defined, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Its conceptual roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, marking a pivotal moment in its formalization.  Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems,  achieving limited success.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions. This paradigm shift, fueled by increased computing power and data availability, has led to significant breakthroughs in recent decades.  Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning constitute major learning paradigms, each suited to different types of problems and data structures.  The synergistic relationship between AI and ML continues to drive innovation across numerous sectors, from healthcare and finance to transportation and entertainment.  We will explore these applications in greater detail throughout the course.
