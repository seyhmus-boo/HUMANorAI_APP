This review examines the rapidly evolving fields of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), highlighting key advancements and ongoing challenges.  AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating intelligent agents, leverages ML techniques – algorithms enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming – to achieve its objectives.  Significant progress has been made in deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks for image recognition and recurrent neural networks for natural language processing, leading to breakthroughs in various applications, including autonomous vehicles, medical diagnosis, and financial forecasting.  However, limitations persist, including issues of data bias leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes,  explainability and interpretability of complex models hindering trust and accountability, and the significant computational resources required for training advanced models.  Furthermore, ethical considerations surrounding AI's impact on employment, privacy, and societal structures demand careful attention.  Future research should prioritize addressing these challenges to ensure the responsible and beneficial development and deployment of AI and ML technologies.  A multidisciplinary approach, integrating computer science with ethics, law, and social sciences, is crucial for navigating the complexities of this transformative technological landscape.
