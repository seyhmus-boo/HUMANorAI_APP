Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming numerous sectors, impacting scientific discovery, industrial processes, and societal structures. This presentation provides a concise overview of the fundamental concepts underpinning these transformative technologies.  We will explore core AI paradigms, including symbolic AI and connectionist approaches, emphasizing the distinct capabilities and limitations of each.  The presentation will then delve into the core principles of ML, focusing on supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques.  Specific algorithms, such as support vector machines, neural networks, and decision trees, will be briefly introduced, highlighting their applications in diverse fields like image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.  Furthermore, the ethical implications and societal challenges posed by the increasing prevalence of AI and ML will be addressed, emphasizing the need for responsible development and deployment of these powerful technologies.  Finally, we will briefly examine future research directions, focusing on advancements in explainable AI (XAI) and the potential for achieving artificial general intelligence (AGI).
