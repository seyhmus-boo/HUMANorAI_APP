Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).  Consider AR as a sophisticated overlay: imagine a heads-up display in a fighter jet, but instead of flight data, you see digital information superimposed onto your real-world view â€“ directions projected onto the street, or furniture virtually placed in your living room before purchase.  It *augments* reality.

Conversely, VR is a complete immersion.  Think of it like stepping into a meticulously crafted simulation; unlike AR's overlay, VR replaces your perception of the real world entirely.  You're not looking *at* a virtual environment, but *within* it.  Applications range from gaming, where you inhabit fantastical worlds, to medical training, allowing surgeons to practice complex procedures without risk to patients.

The distinction lies in their relationship with the physical environment: AR enhances it, blending the digital and the real, while VR replaces it altogether, offering a wholly simulated experience.  Both technologies hold immense potential across diverse sectors, from entertainment and education to healthcare and engineering, offering innovative and engaging solutions to existing challenges.
