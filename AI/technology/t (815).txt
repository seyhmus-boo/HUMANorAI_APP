Blockchain technology, at its core, functions as a distributed, immutable ledger.  Imagine a shared Google Doc, replicated across numerous computers worldwide.  Any change made – akin to recording a transaction – is simultaneously recorded across all copies, creating a permanent, auditable trail. This inherent transparency and immutability, ensured through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms, prevents tampering and fosters trust.  Unlike a centralised database vulnerable to single points of failure, a blockchain distributes trust across a network.

Its applications are diverse.  Consider supply chain management: each stage of a product's journey, from origin to consumer, can be recorded on the blockchain, enhancing traceability and combating counterfeiting.  Similarly, digital identity management benefits from blockchain's secure and verifiable nature, allowing individuals to control and share their data with greater autonomy.  Decentralized finance (DeFi) leverages blockchain to create peer-to-peer financial systems, circumventing traditional intermediaries.  These diverse applications underscore blockchain's potential to revolutionize numerous sectors by promoting transparency, security, and efficiency.
