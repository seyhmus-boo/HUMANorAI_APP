This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications. While current AR/VR technologies rely on classical computational frameworks, we argue that leveraging quantum phenomena offers potential for significant advancements.  Specifically, we examine the possibility of enhancing AR/VR experiences through quantum computing's superior capabilities in simulating complex systems and processing vast datasets.  This could revolutionize realistic rendering, particularly in biomolecular visualizations for medical training or complex fluid dynamics simulations for engineering.

Furthermore, quantum communication protocols could potentially enable secure and high-bandwidth data transmission critical for seamless, lag-free AR/VR experiences, especially in distributed environments.  We will discuss the feasibility of quantum random number generators to improve realism in virtual environments, and the potential for quantum sensing to enhance interaction capabilities, such as more precise gesture recognition and haptic feedback.  Finally, the presentation will identify key challenges and open research questions, including the development of quantum-compatible AR/VR hardware and the exploration of novel quantum algorithms optimized for real-time rendering and interaction.  This interdisciplinary approach promises to unlock transformative capabilities within the AR/VR landscape.
