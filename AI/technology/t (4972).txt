Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating machines capable of intelligent behavior, has its conceptual roots in the mid-20th century, with Alan Turing's seminal work on computation and the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956 widely considered foundational events.  Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, aiming to replicate human cognitive processes through explicit programming.  However, progress was hampered by limitations in computational power and the difficulty of encoding complex real-world knowledge.  Machine learning, a subfield of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach, leveraging algorithms that allow systems to learn patterns and make predictions from data without explicit programming.  This shift, fueled by increasing computing power and the availability of large datasets, has driven significant advancements in recent decades.  While early ML methods like decision trees and support vector machines were effective in specific contexts, the rise of deep learning, employing artificial neural networks with multiple layers, has revolutionized various applications, from image recognition and natural language processing to robotics and autonomous systems.  The symbiotic relationship between AI and ML continues to evolve, with ML providing a powerful toolkit for realizing many of AI's long-standing ambitions.
