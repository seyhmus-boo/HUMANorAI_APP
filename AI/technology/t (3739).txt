This presentation explores the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), tracing its historical trajectory from early conceptualizations to the current state of technological advancement and societal impact.  Early research, dating back to the 1920s with rudimentary demonstrations of automated guidance systems, laid the groundwork for today's sophisticated AVs.  We will examine key milestones, including the development of adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist, and increasingly complex sensor fusion technologies such as LiDAR, radar, and computer vision.  The presentation will then analyze the accelerating integration of artificial intelligence (AI), specifically deep learning algorithms, enabling the transition from advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) towards fully autonomous operation.  Furthermore, we will address the multifaceted challenges hindering widespread AV adoption, encompassing regulatory hurdles, ethical dilemmas concerning accident liability and algorithmic bias, and the critical need for robust cybersecurity measures.  Finally, we will briefly speculate on the future of AVs, considering their potential to revolutionize transportation systems and reshape urban landscapes.
