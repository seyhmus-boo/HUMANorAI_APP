The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and sensor technologies has propelled the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs), promising a transformative impact on transportation systems. This paper examines the key factors driving this technological surge, focusing on breakthroughs in computer vision, deep learning, and sensor fusion.  Significant progress in perception capabilities, enabling robust object detection and classification in complex environments, is highlighted.  However, challenges remain, particularly concerning ethical considerations surrounding accident liability and algorithmic bias, alongside the need for robust cybersecurity measures to prevent malicious attacks.  The socio-economic implications, including job displacement in the transportation sector and potential for increased accessibility for marginalized communities, are also discussed.  While full autonomy remains elusive, the incremental deployment of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) underscores the ongoing evolution towards fully autonomous vehicles.  Future research should focus on addressing ethical dilemmas, establishing robust regulatory frameworks, and ensuring the equitable distribution of benefits and mitigation of risks associated with this disruptive technology.
