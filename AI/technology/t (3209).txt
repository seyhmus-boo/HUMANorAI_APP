Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related technological advancements with a shared history rooted in early computer graphics and simulation research.  Early conceptualizations emerged in the mid-20th century, with Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) considered a pioneering example of a multi-sensory VR experience.  However, the widespread adoption of both technologies was constrained by limitations in computing power and display technologies.  The development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) in the 1960s and 1970s, along with advancements in 3D graphics rendering, laid the groundwork for later breakthroughs.  While VR initially focused on immersive, fully simulated environments, AR gradually gained traction, driven by applications requiring the overlay of digital information onto the real world.  Today, AR applications span diverse fields, including gaming, navigation, and medical training, leveraging smartphones and wearable devices for user interaction.  Conversely, VR finds application in gaming, architectural visualization, and therapeutic interventions, with the potential for more realistic and engaging simulations constantly expanding as processing power and display technologies continue to advance. The convergence of AR and VR, particularly in mixed reality systems, presents exciting possibilities for future development.
