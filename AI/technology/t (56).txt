Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming numerous sectors, yet their core concepts often remain opaque to non-specialists. This presentation aims to demystify these technologies through accessible analogies.  We will explore AI as a broad aspiration – akin to designing a human-like intellect – while positioning ML as a crucial tool within this ambition.  Imagine AI as the blueprint for a self-driving car, encompassing navigation, obstacle avoidance, and decision-making. ML, then, represents the training process – teaching the car to drive through repeated exposure to diverse road conditions and feedback on performance.  We will discuss supervised learning as teaching a child to identify animals through labelled picture books, and unsupervised learning as allowing a child to independently categorize toys based on observed similarities.  Furthermore, we’ll illustrate reinforcement learning using the analogy of training a dog with rewards and punishments.  Finally, we will briefly address the ethical implications inherent in these powerful technologies, comparing the responsibility of AI developers to that of educators raising capable and ethical citizens. This presentation offers a simplified yet insightful introduction to the fundamental principles of AI and ML, providing a framework for further exploration.
