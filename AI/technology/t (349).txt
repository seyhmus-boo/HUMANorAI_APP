Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Machine learning (ML), a crucial subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  ML algorithms identify patterns, build predictive models, and improve their performance over time through iterative processes.  Supervised learning utilizes labelled datasets to train models for classification or regression tasks, while unsupervised learning discovers inherent structures within unlabelled data. Reinforcement learning, conversely, involves agents learning optimal actions through trial-and-error interactions with an environment.  The synergy between AI and ML drives advancements across diverse domains, including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.  However, ethical considerations surrounding bias in datasets, algorithmic transparency, and the potential displacement of human labor remain critical challenges requiring ongoing research and robust regulatory frameworks.  Future research should concentrate on developing more explainable and robust ML models, mitigating biases, and addressing the societal implications of increasingly sophisticated AI systems.
