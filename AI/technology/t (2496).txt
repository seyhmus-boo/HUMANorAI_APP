This presentation explores the rapidly evolving intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart homes.  We examine the core functionalities of IoT devices within a domestic context, focusing on their capacity to enhance convenience, security, and energy efficiency.  Specific applications will be discussed, including smart thermostats capable of learning occupant behaviour and optimizing energy consumption, automated lighting systems that respond to ambient light levels and occupancy detection, and integrated security systems employing interconnected sensors and remote monitoring capabilities.  Furthermore, we will analyze the integration of voice assistants and other human-computer interaction interfaces, enabling intuitive control and management of diverse smart home devices.  The presentation will also briefly address the challenges associated with IoT adoption in smart homes, such as data privacy concerns, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and interoperability issues between different systems.  Ultimately, we aim to provide a balanced overview of the potential benefits and inherent risks of integrating IoT technologies to create truly intelligent and responsive living environments.
