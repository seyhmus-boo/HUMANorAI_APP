The advent of quantum computing presents both significant challenges and potential solutions to cybersecurity.  Currently prevalent cryptographic systems, reliant on the computational intractability of problems like integer factorization (RSA) and discrete logarithm (ECC), become vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm capable of efficiently solving these problems. This undermines the confidentiality and integrity of data protected by these methods.  Furthermore, quantum annealing techniques could accelerate brute-force attacks against symmetric encryption, though the impact is less immediately catastrophic.

However, quantum mechanics also offers potential solutions.  Quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages the principles of quantum entanglement and measurement to establish unconditionally secure communication channels, impervious to eavesdropping. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) explores cryptographic algorithms believed to be resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers, encompassing lattice-based, code-based, and multivariate cryptography.  While PQC algorithms are computationally more expensive than current standards, their resilience to future quantum threats justifies the trade-off.  The transition to PQC requires careful planning and standardization to ensure widespread adoption and interoperability, mitigating the potential for a widespread cryptographic collapse.
