The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology promises a transformative shift in transportation, yet significant experimental challenges remain. This presentation will explore key hurdles hindering the widespread deployment of fully autonomous systems.  We will focus on three critical areas:  robust perception in complex and dynamic environments, including handling edge cases and unpredictable human behavior; safe and reliable decision-making under uncertainty, encompassing ethical dilemmas and the limitations of current algorithms in anticipating unforeseen circumstances; and the validation and verification of AV systems, addressing the need for rigorous testing methodologies to ensure safety and compliance across diverse operational domains.  The presentation will highlight the limitations of current simulation and real-world testing approaches and discuss the need for innovative experimental designs that better capture the complexity and uncertainty inherent in real-world driving.  Finally, we will consider the ethical implications of experimental design, emphasizing the importance of responsible innovation in this rapidly evolving field.  This discussion aims to stimulate conversation and collaboration on addressing these critical experimental challenges, paving the way for safer and more reliable autonomous vehicles.
