Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the ascendance of autonomous vehicles.  Consider the evolution of flight: initially, piloting demanded intense skill and constant human intervention.  Over time, advancements in autopilot systems gradually offloaded tasks, culminating in sophisticated systems capable of managing most aspects of flight, albeit still under human supervision.  Autonomous vehicles mirror this trajectory.

Initially, rudimentary driver-assistance systems, like cruise control, represented the nascent stages.  These acted as simple augmentations, analogous to early flight instruments.  Subsequently, more sophisticated systems – adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping assist – emerged, comparable to more advanced autopilot features.  Now, we stand at the cusp of fully autonomous vehicles, representing a paradigm shift analogous to the development of fully autonomous drones or spacecraft.  This transition, however, necessitates overcoming complex challenges – ethical considerations surrounding decision-making algorithms, robust sensor technology to handle diverse environments, and the crucial aspect of regulatory frameworks – all crucial for a safe and effective transition.
