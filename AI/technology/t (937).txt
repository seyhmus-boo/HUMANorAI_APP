This presentation explores the experimental challenges associated with leveraging big data in modern industries. While big data analytics promises transformative insights across diverse sectors, realizing this potential is hampered by significant methodological hurdles.  We will focus on three key experimental challenges: (1) **Data heterogeneity and quality:**  The sheer volume and variety of data necessitate robust preprocessing techniques to handle inconsistencies, missing values, and noisy data.  Developing reliable and scalable methods for data cleaning and integration remains a crucial area of research. (2) **Causality inference:**  Correlations observed in big data frequently fail to establish causal relationships.  Establishing causality, essential for informed decision-making, requires sophisticated experimental designs and statistical methods capable of handling confounding variables and selection bias within massive datasets. (3) **Reproducibility and generalizability:**  The complexity of big data analyses often compromises reproducibility, hindering validation and widespread adoption.  We will discuss strategies to enhance the transparency and replicability of big data experiments, emphasizing the importance of rigorous documentation, open-source tools, and standardized evaluation metrics. Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for unlocking the true transformative power of big data across various industries. The presentation will conclude by highlighting promising avenues for future research.
