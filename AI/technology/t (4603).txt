Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are interconnected yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Its historical roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, marking the formal inception of the field. Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, emerged later and focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming. Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and build models from input data to make predictions or decisions.  This paradigm shift, driven by increasing computational power and the availability of large datasets, has fueled recent breakthroughs in AI.  Different ML approaches exist, including supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (identifying patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).  The synergy between AI's broader goals and ML's data-driven approach is currently driving significant advancements across numerous domains.
