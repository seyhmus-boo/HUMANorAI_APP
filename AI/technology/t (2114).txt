Quantum computing holds immense promise, but its transition from theoretical possibility to practical application hinges on overcoming significant experimental hurdles. This presentation will explore key challenges currently limiting the advancement of quantum computing hardware. We will focus on three primary areas:  (1) qubit coherence: maintaining the delicate quantum superposition and entanglement essential for computation, hindered by environmental noise and decoherence;  (2) scalability: building and controlling large-scale quantum systems with sufficient fidelity and minimizing cross-talk between qubits; and (3) error correction: developing robust and efficient quantum error correction codes to mitigate the impact of noise and ensure reliable computation.  We will discuss recent advancements in mitigating these challenges, including novel qubit designs, improved fabrication techniques, and innovative error correction strategies.  Furthermore, we will examine the potential of hybrid quantum-classical architectures and explore the crucial role of materials science in overcoming the limitations of current technologies. The presentation will conclude by highlighting the ongoing research and development needed to realize fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of solving currently intractable problems.
