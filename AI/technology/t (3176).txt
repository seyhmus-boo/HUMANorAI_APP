Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computer systems to learn from and make predictions based on data without explicit programming.  This learning process involves identifying patterns, making inferences, and improving performance over time through iterative exposure to data.  The practical applications of these technologies are vast and rapidly expanding.  In healthcare, ML algorithms power diagnostic tools for diseases like cancer, improving accuracy and efficiency.  Financial institutions utilize AI for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on AI and ML for object recognition and navigation.  Furthermore, in the realm of natural language processing, AI powers sophisticated chatbots and language translation services, revolutionizing communication and customer service.  The continued development and refinement of AI and ML are expected to have a profound and transformative impact across numerous sectors in the coming decades.
