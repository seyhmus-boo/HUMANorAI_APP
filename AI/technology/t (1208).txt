Cloud computing's evolution, from nascent grid computing to today's multifaceted service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), has been accompanied by significant experimental challenges.  Early limitations in network bandwidth and latency hampered the scalability and responsiveness of distributed applications, hindering the widespread adoption of cloud-based services.  Furthermore, ensuring data security and privacy within a shared infrastructure remains a critical hurdle, necessitating rigorous research into encryption techniques, access control mechanisms, and robust auditing procedures.  Experimental work continues to grapple with efficient resource allocation and management across heterogeneous environments, striving for optimal performance while mitigating the risk of resource contention and "noisy neighbours."  The emergence of serverless computing presents new challenges related to function orchestration, cold starts, and cost optimization, while the increasing reliance on AI/ML introduces complexities in model training, deployment, and the management of vast datasets within the cloud.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is crucial for realizing the full potential of cloud computing and ensuring its continued growth and maturity.
