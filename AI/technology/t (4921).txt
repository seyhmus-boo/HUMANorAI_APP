Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subfield, machine learning (ML), face significant experimental challenges despite rapid advancements.  A primary hurdle lies in data acquisition and quality.  ML models are data-hungry, demanding vast, diverse, and accurately labelled datasets, which are often expensive and difficult to obtain.  Bias in these datasets, reflecting societal prejudices or sampling errors, propagates through the model, leading to unfair or inaccurate predictions.  Furthermore, evaluating model performance remains problematic.  Standard metrics may not adequately capture nuanced aspects of real-world applications, leading to overestimation or underestimation of effectiveness.  Explainability, or the ability to understand a model's decision-making process, presents another challenge, particularly for complex deep learning architectures.  This "black box" nature hinders trust and deployment in high-stakes domains like healthcare and finance.  Finally, the computational resources required for training and deploying sophisticated AI/ML systems remain considerable, limiting accessibility and scalability for many researchers and applications. Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for realizing the full potential of AI/ML.
