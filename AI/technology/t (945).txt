Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications represent a burgeoning field deeply rooted in interdisciplinary collaboration.  Their development necessitates expertise from computer science, encompassing areas like 3D modelling, graphics rendering, and human-computer interaction.  Psychology plays a crucial role in understanding user experience, cognitive load, and the impact of immersion on perception and behaviour.  Furthermore, engineering contributes significantly to hardware development, including display technologies, sensors, and tracking systems vital for creating realistic and responsive experiences.  Design disciplines, such as industrial and interaction design, are essential for crafting intuitive and aesthetically pleasing interfaces that enhance usability.  Finally, fields like medicine and education leverage AR/VR for innovative applications, such as surgical simulations and interactive learning environments, highlighting the translational potential of these technologies across diverse sectors.  The synergistic integration of these diverse disciplines is paramount for realising the full potential of AR and VR.
