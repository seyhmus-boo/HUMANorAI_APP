The Internet of Things (IoT), a network of interconnected physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies, has profoundly impacted various sectors, notably domestic environments, giving rise to the concept of the "smart home."  Historically, rudimentary automation existed in homes, such as programmable thermostats. However, the convergence of advancements in microelectronics, wireless communication (e.g., Wi-Fi, Zigbee), and cloud computing in the late 20th and early 21st centuries facilitated the exponential growth of IoT.  Smart homes leverage this infrastructure to interconnect appliances and devices, enabling remote control and automation.  This includes smart lighting, security systems, energy management, and entertainment systems communicating and coordinating via a central hub or network. While offering increased convenience and efficiency, the proliferation of IoT devices also raises concerns regarding data security, privacy, and the potential for system vulnerabilities.  Future research will undoubtedly focus on mitigating these risks while enhancing the functionality and user-friendliness of smart home systems.
