Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, fostering significant interdisciplinary collaborations across computer science, engineering, psychology, and the humanities. This abstract examines the burgeoning applications of AR/VR, highlighting their interconnected nature and interdisciplinary implications.  Computer science underpins the technological foundation, developing advanced rendering techniques, haptic feedback systems, and intuitive interfaces.  Engineering contributes through the design and manufacturing of wearable devices and immersive environments.  Psychology plays a crucial role in understanding user experience, cognitive load, and the potential impact on human perception and behavior, informing the design of effective and engaging applications.  Furthermore,  the humanities contribute valuable insights into ethical considerations, accessibility issues, and the social implications of these technologies, ensuring responsible innovation.  Applications span diverse fields, including education (immersive learning), healthcare (surgical simulation, phobia treatment), entertainment (gaming, interactive storytelling), and engineering (design visualization, remote collaboration).  Future research should prioritize user-centered design, addressing issues of accessibility and ethical implications to maximize the positive societal impact of AR/VR across disciplines.
