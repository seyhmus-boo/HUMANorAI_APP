Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming numerous sectors, impacting scientific discovery, industrial processes, and everyday life. This presentation provides a concise overview of the fundamental concepts underpinning AI and ML, differentiating supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning paradigms.  We will explore key algorithms, including neural networks, support vector machines, and decision trees, highlighting their strengths and limitations across diverse application domains.  The presentation will further examine the ethical implications inherent in the deployment of AI/ML systems, addressing issues of bias, fairness, and accountability.  Specific examples of successful AI/ML applications in fields such as healthcare (disease diagnosis), finance (fraud detection), and environmental science (climate modeling) will be presented to illustrate the transformative potential of these technologies. Finally, we will briefly discuss current challenges and future directions in AI/ML research, emphasizing the need for robust data management, explainable AI, and interdisciplinary collaboration to maximize the societal benefits while mitigating potential risks.
