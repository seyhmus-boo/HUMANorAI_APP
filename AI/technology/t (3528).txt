This presentation explores the evolution of cloud computing, highlighting its increasingly interdisciplinary nature.  Initially conceived as a simplified model for distributed computing, cloud computing has rapidly expanded beyond its technological roots. We trace this evolution, examining its transformative impact across diverse fields.  The presentation will discuss the interdisciplinary links between cloud computing and areas such as economics (market structures, pricing models), law (data privacy, cybersecurity), sociology (work practices, digital divides), and environmental science (energy consumption, carbon footprint).  Furthermore, we analyze the ethical implications arising from the centralized nature of cloud services,  addressing issues of data sovereignty and algorithmic bias.  By highlighting these interdisciplinary connections, we aim to illustrate the complex societal and environmental consequences of cloud computing's ubiquitous presence and to encourage future research exploring these multifaceted interactions.  Finally, we will briefly consider emerging trends, such as edge computing and serverless architectures, and their potential to reshape the interdisciplinary landscape of cloud computing in the years to come.
