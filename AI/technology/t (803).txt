Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the creation of intelligent agents capable of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on the development of systems that learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on input data.  This learning process can be supervised, unsupervised, or reinforcement-based, each with its own methodology and applications.

The practical implications are vast.  Supervised learning powers spam filters and medical diagnosis tools by learning from labeled data. Unsupervised learning algorithms cluster customers for targeted marketing or identify anomalies in financial transactions. Reinforcement learning is employed in robotics and game playing, enabling agents to learn optimal strategies through trial and error.  These applications highlight the transformative potential of AI and ML across diverse sectors, promising increased efficiency, improved decision-making, and the emergence of entirely novel technologies.
