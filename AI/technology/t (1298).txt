Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI encompasses the broader goal of creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. ML, a subset of AI, focuses on developing algorithms that allow systems to learn from and make predictions on data without explicit programming.  This learning occurs through the identification of patterns and relationships within datasets, enabling the system to improve its performance over time.  Supervised learning utilizes labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning explores unlabeled data to discover underlying structures. Reinforcement learning, conversely, involves an agent learning through trial-and-error interaction with an environment.  The synergy between AI and ML is driving advancements across numerous sectors, from healthcare and finance to transportation and manufacturing, promising both significant benefits and potential ethical challenges that require careful consideration.  Further research is needed to address issues of bias, transparency, and the responsible deployment of these powerful technologies.
