This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs).  While AV development primarily leverages classical computing and sensor technologies, we argue that a quantum mechanical perspective offers crucial insights and potential for future advancements.  Specifically, we will examine the inherent limitations of classical approaches in handling the complexity of real-time environmental perception and decision-making within AV systems.  The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, mirrored in the inherent uncertainties of real-world driving scenarios, suggests the potential utility of quantum algorithms for tasks like sensor fusion, path planning, and collision avoidance.  We will discuss the applicability of quantum machine learning techniques for training more robust and adaptable AV control systems, surpassing the limitations of classical neural networks in handling high-dimensional data and noisy sensor inputs. While scalable quantum computers remain a future prospect,  we will highlight near-term opportunities for quantum-inspired classical algorithms to enhance AV performance and safety.  Finally, we will briefly address potential challenges and future research directions in this emerging interdisciplinary field, emphasizing the need for a foundational understanding of quantum mechanics in the pursuit of truly intelligent and safe autonomous vehicles.
