Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet, represents a paradigm shift in information technology.  Its evolution can be traced back to the early days of time-sharing systems in the 1960s, which provided a rudimentary form of resource pooling.  The subsequent development of client-server architectures in the 1980s laid the groundwork for distributed computing, allowing applications to be accessed from remote locations.  However, the true genesis of cloud computing is widely attributed to the emergence of the Internet and the rapid advancements in virtualization technologies during the late 1990s and early 2000s.  These innovations facilitated the creation of scalable and flexible infrastructure capable of delivering services on demand.  Early adopters, primarily large enterprises, utilized cloud services for specific applications, gradually expanding adoption across diverse functionalities.  The proliferation of service models, categorized as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), further broadened the accessibility and application of cloud computing, ultimately transforming it into the ubiquitous and transformative technology it is today. The continuing evolution involves increased sophistication in areas like artificial intelligence, edge computing, and serverless architectures, driving further innovation and adoption across all sectors.
