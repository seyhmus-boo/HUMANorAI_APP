Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on cloud computing and its evolutionary trajectory.  Initially conceived as a distributed computing paradigm, cloud computing has rapidly evolved from simple file storage to a sophisticated ecosystem offering Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).  This evolution has been driven by advancements in virtualization, network bandwidth, and data storage technologies.

Early iterations, predominantly relying on grid computing principles, laid the groundwork for the contemporary cloud.  The emergence of virtualization enabled efficient resource allocation, leading to the proliferation of IaaS providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS).  Subsequently, PaaS platforms like Google App Engine simplified application deployment and management, while SaaS models, exemplified by Salesforce, democratized access to sophisticated software applications.  These services underpin myriad practical applications, from e-commerce platforms and social media networks to scientific simulations and healthcare data management.  The continued advancement of cloud computing promises even greater scalability, efficiency, and accessibility in the future.
