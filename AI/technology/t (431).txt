This review examines the burgeoning field of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, highlighting their diverse functionalities and impacts across various sectors.  While VR offers immersive, fully simulated environments, AR overlays digital information onto the real world, creating distinct yet complementary experiences.  The review explores significant advancements in hardware, including improved head-mounted displays and spatial tracking technologies, which have facilitated more realistic and user-friendly applications.  Key application areas discussed include gaming and entertainment, education and training (particularly in fields requiring high-fidelity simulation), healthcare (surgical planning and rehabilitation), and engineering (design and prototyping).  However, challenges remain, including the high cost of development and implementation, the potential for motion sickness and other user discomfort associated with VR, and concerns regarding data privacy and security.  Furthermore, the review identifies a need for further research into user experience optimization, content creation, and the ethical implications of increasingly realistic virtual and augmented environments.  Future development will likely focus on integrating AR and VR technologies to create hybrid experiences and seamless interactions with the physical world.
