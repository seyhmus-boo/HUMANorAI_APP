The Internet of Things (IoT), encompassing interconnected devices communicating via the internet, has profoundly impacted residential environments, giving rise to the concept of the smart home.  Early precursors to IoT in homes emerged with the development of programmable thermostats and remote-controlled appliances in the late 20th century. However, the proliferation of low-cost microcontrollers, enhanced wireless communication protocols (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi), and cloud computing in the 21st century catalyzed the exponential growth of smart home technologies.

Contemporary smart homes leverage IoT to integrate diverse functionalities, including automated lighting, security systems, energy management, and entertainment systems. Data collected from various sensors embedded within these devices allows for sophisticated automation and personalized user experiences. While offering convenience and enhanced efficiency, the integration of IoT in homes presents challenges. Concerns regarding data privacy, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and the potential for device interoperability issues require careful consideration.  Furthermore, the ethical implications of pervasive data collection and the environmental impact of electronic waste generated by rapidly evolving technology demand ongoing scrutiny within the field.  Future research should prioritize addressing these challenges to fully realize the potential benefits of smart homes while mitigating associated risks.
