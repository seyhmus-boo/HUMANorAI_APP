Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the experimental challenges inherent in developing robust augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications.  A primary hurdle lies in achieving seamless integration between the real and virtual worlds in AR.  Precise spatial tracking and registration remain problematic, often resulting in jarring misalignments that disrupt user immersion.  Similarly, accurate environmental mapping for AR applications necessitates overcoming computational limitations and achieving real-time processing of complex visual data.

In VR, the challenges centre around user experience.  Motion sickness, stemming from sensory conflicts between visual input and vestibular perception, significantly hinders usability.  Furthermore, achieving realistic haptic feedback, crucial for genuine immersion, poses significant technological hurdles.  Developing affordable and effective haptic devices that accurately simulate texture and force remains an active area of research.  Finally, both AR and VR development face challenges concerning scalability and accessibility, requiring solutions to overcome high computational demands and the limitations of current hardware.  These represent ongoing areas of intense investigation within the field.
