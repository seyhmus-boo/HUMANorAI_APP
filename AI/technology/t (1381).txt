Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the evolution of cloud computing.  Initially conceived as a utility-based model for accessing computing resources, cloud computing has undergone a dramatic transformation.  Early iterations, primarily characterized by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), offered virtualized hardware.  This evolved into Platform as a Service (PaaS), abstracting away infrastructure management for application deployment.  More recently, the rise of Serverless computing, a component of Function as a Service (FaaS), represents a significant advancement, allowing developers to focus solely on code without infrastructure concerns.

Recent developments are heavily influenced by the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). Cloud providers are now heavily invested in integrating AI/ML capabilities directly into their platforms, offering pre-trained models, specialized hardware, and managed services for training and deploying AI applications.  Furthermore, advancements in edge computing are decentralizing processing, addressing latency issues and enhancing real-time applications. The integration of quantum computing capabilities, though still in its nascent stages, holds the potential to revolutionize the field further.  These developments underscore cloud computing's continued evolution towards greater accessibility, efficiency, and computational power.
