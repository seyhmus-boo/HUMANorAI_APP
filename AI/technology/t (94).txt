Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation.  Its roots can be traced back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, often considered the birth of AI as a field, where researchers laid out ambitious goals for creating truly intelligent machines.  Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and knowledge representation, with limited success in tackling real-world complexities.  The subsequent decades witnessed periods of both optimism and disillusionment, known as AI winters, as progress stalled against the limitations of computational power and algorithmic sophistication.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a more empirically driven approach. Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data, adapting and improving their performance over time.  This paradigm shift, fueled by increasing computational power and the availability of vast datasets, has led to the recent resurgence of AI.  Key ML techniques, such as neural networks and deep learning, have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing, significantly advancing the capabilities of AI systems and impacting numerous aspects of modern life.
