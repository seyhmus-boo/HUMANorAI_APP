The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a culmination of advancements across several technological domains, building upon decades of research in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and robotics.  Early conceptualizations emerged in the mid-20th century, notably with the General Motors Firebird II concept car in 1956, showcasing rudimentary automated driving features.  However, significant progress hinged on the development of more powerful computing capabilities and sophisticated sensor technologies, particularly in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

The proliferation of GPS, lidar, radar, and high-resolution cameras provided the sensory input necessary for AV navigation and object recognition.  Simultaneously, breakthroughs in machine learning, specifically deep learning algorithms, enabled vehicles to process this complex sensory data and make real-time driving decisions. This convergence facilitated the emergence of companies like Tesla, Waymo, and Cruise, actively developing and testing AV technologies.  The rise of AVs is therefore not a singular event, but a gradual process driven by technological maturity and the convergence of several previously disparate fields.  Ethical and regulatory challenges, however, remain significant barriers to widespread adoption.
