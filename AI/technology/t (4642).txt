5G networks represent a significant advancement in wireless communication technology, profoundly impacting various sectors. This review examines the key technological advancements driving 5G's capabilities, including higher frequency bands (mmWave), massive MIMO, and network slicing.  These innovations deliver substantially increased data rates, reduced latency, and enhanced network capacity, enabling the proliferation of bandwidth-intensive applications.  The impact on technology is multifaceted, encompassing the accelerated development of the Internet of Things (IoT), facilitating seamless connectivity for billions of devices.  Furthermore, 5G underpins advancements in augmented and virtual reality, enabling immersive experiences previously constrained by bandwidth limitations.  The automotive industry benefits significantly from 5G's low latency, supporting autonomous driving and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication.  While offering substantial advantages, challenges remain, including coverage limitations, particularly in mmWave deployments, and the need for robust security protocols to address potential vulnerabilities.  Future research should focus on mitigating these challenges to fully realize 5G's transformative potential across diverse technological landscapes.
