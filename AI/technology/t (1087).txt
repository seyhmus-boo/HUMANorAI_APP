Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming numerous scientific disciplines and technological sectors.  This abstract provides a concise overview of these interconnected fields. AI encompasses the broader goal of creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, including learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  ML, a core subfield of AI, focuses on developing algorithms that allow systems to learn from and make predictions based on data, without explicit programming.  Various ML approaches exist, including supervised learning (e.g., classification, regression), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning (e.g., robotics, game playing).  Recent advancements, driven by increased computational power and the availability of large datasets, have led to significant breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and medical diagnosis.  However, challenges remain, including addressing biases in data, ensuring model explainability and trustworthiness, and mitigating ethical concerns surrounding AI deployment. Future research will likely focus on developing more robust, generalizable, and ethically sound AI and ML systems capable of tackling complex real-world problems.
