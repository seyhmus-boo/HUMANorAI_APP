Cloud computing's evolution from simple remote storage to sophisticated distributed systems presents several experimental challenges.  Early experiments focused on validating fundamental concepts like virtualization and resource allocation, often hampered by limitations in network bandwidth and security protocols.  Subsequent research grappled with scalability issues, exploring efficient algorithms for task distribution across heterogeneous infrastructure and developing robust fault tolerance mechanisms.  Experimentation in this realm necessitates the creation of realistic, large-scale simulated environments due to the cost and complexity of deploying real-world cloud systems.  Furthermore, accurately measuring performance and resource utilization in dynamic cloud environments remains a significant challenge, demanding novel benchmarking methodologies.  Recent work explores the experimental complexities of serverless architectures and edge computing, investigating latency issues, data locality, and the impact of decentralized control on resource optimization. Addressing these experimental limitations is critical for refining existing cloud technologies and advancing the field.
