This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), emphasizing their rapidly expanding practical applications across diverse sectors. We will explore the fundamental distinctions between AI and ML, clarifying the role of algorithms, data, and computational power in enabling intelligent systems.  The discussion will highlight key ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, illustrating their application through real-world examples.

Specific applications to be examined include advancements in medical diagnosis through image analysis and predictive modeling, the optimization of supply chains using predictive maintenance and demand forecasting, and personalized recommendations in e-commerce driven by user behaviour analysis.  Furthermore, we will briefly touch upon the ethical considerations and potential societal impacts of increasingly sophisticated AI and ML systems, including issues of bias, transparency, and accountability.  The presentation concludes by considering future research directions and the transformative potential of these technologies across a wide range of human endeavors.
