This presentation examines the experimental challenges encountered in researching the impact of 5G networks on diverse technological domains.  While 5G promises significant advancements in speed, latency, and connectivity, realizing its full potential necessitates overcoming several hurdles.  Our focus lies on three key areas: (1)  **Reproducibility and Standardization:** The heterogeneity of 5G deployments across different vendors and geographical locations presents a significant challenge in establishing reproducible experimental results.  Lack of standardization in testing methodologies hampers comparative analysis and the identification of universally applicable improvements. (2)  **Scalability and Realistic Emulation:**  Replicating the complexity and scale of real-world 5G networks in experimental settings proves demanding.  Existing emulation tools often fall short of accurately simulating crucial aspects such as network interference, mobility, and heterogeneous user density. (3)  **Data Acquisition and Analysis:**  The sheer volume of data generated by 5G networks requires sophisticated data acquisition and processing techniques.  Developing robust methods for extracting meaningful insights from this massive dataset is crucial for understanding the true impact of 5G on application performance and user experience.  This presentation will discuss these experimental challenges, propose potential solutions, and highlight ongoing research efforts aiming to address these limitations for a more comprehensive understanding of 5G's transformative capabilities.
