Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming numerous sectors, yet their core concepts remain elusive to many.  This presentation employs accessible analogies to clarify these powerful technologies.  We will illustrate AI as a sophisticated chef, capable of creating complex dishes (solving complex problems) based on a broad understanding of ingredients (data) and culinary techniques (algorithms).  However, unlike a human chef who relies on explicit recipes, AI systems, particularly those utilizing machine learning, often learn implicitly.  ML, in this analogy, is akin to an apprentice chef learning through experience.  Instead of being explicitly programmed with recipes, the apprentice observes the master chef (data), identifying patterns and refining techniques (algorithms) to improve their own culinary skills (prediction accuracy) over time. This iterative process of learning from data, without explicit programming, is central to the power of ML. We will explore various ML approaches, such as supervised learning (following a recipe book) and unsupervised learning (experimenting with ingredients without a predefined outcome), using further culinary examples to illustrate their strengths and limitations. Ultimately, this presentation aims to demystify AI and ML, providing a foundational understanding through relatable everyday contexts.
