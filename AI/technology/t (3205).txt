Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications represent burgeoning fields with significant potential across diverse sectors.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception and interaction, while VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments.  This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of these technologies, focusing on their distinct affordances and overlapping applications.  AR's strength lies in its ability to bridge the physical and digital realms, facilitating applications in training (e.g., surgical simulations), design (e.g., architectural visualization), and entertainment (e.g., interactive gaming).  Conversely, VR excels in creating highly immersive experiences, particularly valuable in therapeutic contexts (e.g., exposure therapy for phobias) and simulations requiring complete environmental control (e.g., flight training).  However, limitations exist; AR's effectiveness is contingent on accurate object recognition and contextual awareness, while VR can induce motion sickness and require substantial hardware resources.  Future research should explore the synergistic potential of integrating AR and VR, creating hybrid systems that leverage the strengths of both technologies to enhance user experience and broaden applicability.
