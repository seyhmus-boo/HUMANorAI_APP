Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly evolving fields with significant overlap, yet distinct focuses.  AI, encompassing a broader scope, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses specifically on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This learning process involves algorithms that identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time through iterative training on datasets.  Supervised learning, where labeled data guides the algorithm, and unsupervised learning, where the algorithm identifies patterns in unlabeled data, are two prominent ML paradigms.  Deep learning, a subfield of ML employing artificial neural networks with multiple layers, has recently achieved remarkable success in various applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.  The synergy between AI and ML continues to drive innovation across numerous sectors, though ethical considerations surrounding bias, transparency, and accountability remain critical research areas requiring ongoing investigation.
