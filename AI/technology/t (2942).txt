Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) represent distinct yet intertwined fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  ML, a subfield of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms that allow systems to learn from and make predictions on data without explicit programming. This learning process typically involves the identification of patterns and relationships within datasets, enabling the system to improve its performance over time.  Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning are key paradigms within ML, each employing different approaches to data processing and model training.  The synergy between AI and ML is evident in numerous applications, ranging from medical diagnosis and financial modeling to autonomous vehicles and natural language processing.  Ongoing research explores advancements in deep learning, a powerful subset of ML leveraging artificial neural networks, aiming to enhance the capabilities and applicability of AI systems across diverse domains.  However, ethical considerations surrounding bias in algorithms, data privacy, and the potential displacement of human labor remain significant challenges requiring ongoing attention.
