Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly evolving fields with significant implications across numerous disciplines.  This lecture elucidates the fundamental distinctions and interrelationships between these concepts. AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This learning process involves algorithms that identify patterns, make predictions, and improve performance over time through exposure to new data.  Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning represent key paradigms within ML, each employing different methodologies to extract knowledge from datasets. The lecture further explores the ethical considerations and societal impacts associated with the increasing deployment of AI and ML systems, emphasizing the need for responsible development and deployment to mitigate potential biases and risks.  Finally,  future research directions in both fields, particularly within areas like deep learning and explainable AI, are highlighted.
