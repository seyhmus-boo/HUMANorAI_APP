This presentation examines the burgeoning intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home technologies.  We explore the architectural components of smart homes, encompassing diverse IoT devices such as smart appliances, environmental sensors, and security systems, and the communication protocols facilitating their interconnectedness.  A key focus is the analysis of data management strategies within the smart home ecosystem, including data security and privacy concerns arising from the proliferation of connected devices.  Furthermore, the presentation addresses the challenges associated with interoperability and standardization within the currently fragmented IoT landscape. We discuss the potential for enhanced energy efficiency, improved home security, and personalized user experiences through intelligent automation, alongside the ethical implications of pervasive data collection and the potential for vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.  Finally, we offer a critical assessment of the current state of smart home technology and propose directions for future research, focusing on advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) integration and the development of robust security frameworks to mitigate potential risks.
