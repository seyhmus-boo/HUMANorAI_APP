Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly expanding their applications across diverse sectors.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception and interaction with their environment.  Examples include navigation systems providing real-time directions superimposed on a live camera feed, and medical applications enabling surgeons to visualize internal anatomy during procedures.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, generating a sense of presence and engagement unattainable through traditional interfaces.  Applications range from immersive gaming experiences to therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD, and increasingly sophisticated training simulations for various professions, including aviation and surgery.  The convergence of AR and VR, often termed mixed reality (MR), promises even more sophisticated applications, blurring the lines between the physical and digital realms.  However, challenges remain, particularly concerning hardware limitations, development costs, and the potential for user disorientation or cyber sickness.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations and exploring the ethical implications of increasingly realistic and immersive AR/VR experiences.
