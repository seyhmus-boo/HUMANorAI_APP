Cloud computing, initially conceived as utility computing, has undergone a significant evolution since its inception.  This review traces its trajectory from early grid computing models to the current dominant Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) paradigms.  Early limitations, including security concerns and bandwidth restrictions, have been largely addressed by advancements in virtualization, network infrastructure, and data security protocols.  The emergence of serverless computing and edge computing represents a further evolution, decentralizing processing and enabling faster response times for applications. This shift reflects a growing demand for scalability, elasticity, and cost-effectiveness, driving innovation in areas such as containerization (Docker, Kubernetes) and orchestration. While benefits are substantial, challenges remain, including vendor lock-in, data sovereignty issues, and the need for robust security architectures to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.  Future research should focus on optimizing resource allocation in multi-cloud environments and developing more sophisticated AI-driven management solutions to fully realize the potential of this rapidly evolving technology.
