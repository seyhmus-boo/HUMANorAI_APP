This presentation explores the experimental challenges encountered in researching and deploying 5G networks and their subsequent impact on technological advancements.  While 5G promises significantly enhanced speed, lower latency, and increased capacity, realizing this potential faces substantial hurdles.  Our research focuses on three key areas:  (1)  the accurate modelling and measurement of 5G channel characteristics, particularly in complex urban environments; existing models often fail to capture the nuances of millimeter-wave propagation and the impact of dynamic obstacles. (2)  the development and validation of efficient resource management techniques;  the high density of devices and the need for ultra-reliable low-latency communication require innovative solutions, posing significant challenges for experimental verification. (3)  the testing and integration of diverse 5G technologies and applications; the heterogeneous nature of 5G deployments, encompassing network slicing and edge computing, necessitate robust and scalable testing methodologies to evaluate interoperability and performance. This presentation will highlight our ongoing experimental work addressing these challenges, including innovative measurement techniques, simulation frameworks, and testbed architectures, and will discuss the implications of these findings for future 5G research and development.
