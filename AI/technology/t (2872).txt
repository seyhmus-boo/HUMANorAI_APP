This presentation traces the evolution of cloud computing from its nascent stages to its current pervasive influence across diverse sectors.  We will examine the foundational shifts from centralized mainframes to distributed client-server architectures, highlighting pivotal technological advancements such as virtualization, containerization, and serverless computing.  This progression has facilitated the emergence of various service models – Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) – each catering to distinct user needs and levels of abstraction.

The presentation will explore the practical applications of cloud computing across multiple domains.  We will showcase examples of its impact on healthcare, enabling remote patient monitoring and data analytics; in finance, facilitating high-frequency trading and secure data storage; and in manufacturing, supporting predictive maintenance and supply chain optimization.  Furthermore, the discussion will address emerging trends such as edge computing and the increasing importance of data security and privacy within cloud environments.  Finally, we will briefly consider future directions, including the potential impact of quantum computing and the ongoing challenges of sustainability in the cloud.
