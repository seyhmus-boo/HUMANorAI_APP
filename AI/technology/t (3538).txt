Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet interconnected paradigms within the realm of human-computer interaction, offering transformative applications across diverse fields. AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing perception and interaction with the environment.  This enables applications such as interactive training simulations (e.g., surgical procedures), real-time navigation systems, and immersive gaming experiences.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, decoupling them from physical reality. This allows for highly controlled experimentation, as seen in therapeutic interventions for phobias or the creation of engaging virtual worlds for entertainment and education.  While AR prioritizes context awareness, VR emphasizes immersion and control.  The convergence of these technologies, often termed mixed reality, promises even more sophisticated applications, combining elements of both to create seamless interactions between the physical and digital worlds.  Future research should focus on addressing limitations concerning usability, accessibility, and the potential psychological impacts of prolonged exposure to immersive digital environments.
