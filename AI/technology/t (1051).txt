This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and the rapidly advancing field of autonomous vehicles (AVs). While the immediate engineering challenges of AVs reside primarily in classical domains, a quantum mechanical perspective offers valuable insights into several key limitations.  We will argue that current reliance on classical computation for tasks such as sensor fusion, object recognition, and path planning faces inherent scalability bottlenecks.  Quantum algorithms, particularly those leveraging quantum machine learning, offer a potential pathway to overcome these limitations, enabling significantly faster and more robust processing of the vast amounts of data required for safe and efficient AV operation.

Specifically, we will examine the potential applications of quantum annealing for optimization problems inherent in route planning and traffic flow management. Furthermore, the application of quantum machine learning to enhance object recognition, addressing the challenges posed by noisy and ambiguous sensor data, will be discussed.  The presentation will conclude by outlining the current limitations and significant challenges in realizing these quantum-enhanced AV systems, highlighting the need for further research into fault-tolerant quantum computation and the development of quantum-compatible sensors.  This exploration aims to initiate discussion on how quantum mechanics may fundamentally reshape the future of autonomous transportation.
