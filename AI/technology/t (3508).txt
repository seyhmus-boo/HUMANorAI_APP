Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the rapidly evolving fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  While AI encompasses the broader goal of creating intelligent agents, ML provides a crucial subset of techniques enabling this.  Recent advancements centre on deep learning, a subfield of ML utilizing artificial neural networks with multiple layers.  This architecture has driven breakthroughs in image recognition, surpassing human accuracy in certain tasks.

Furthermore, the development of transformer networks has revolutionised natural language processing (NLP), powering sophisticated language models capable of generating human-quality text and exhibiting impressive contextual understanding.  Reinforcement learning continues to advance, demonstrated by successes in complex game playing and robotics.  However, ethical considerations surrounding bias in algorithms, data privacy, and the potential for job displacement remain critical areas of ongoing research and debate.  The future of AI and ML hinges on addressing these challenges while harnessing their transformative potential responsibly.
