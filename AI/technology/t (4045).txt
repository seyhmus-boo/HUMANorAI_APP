Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the creation of intelligent agents capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on input data.  This distinction is crucial.  AI represents the overarching goal, while ML provides a powerful toolset for achieving it.

Practical applications are ubiquitous.  In healthcare, ML algorithms diagnose diseases from medical images with increasing accuracy.  Finance leverages AI for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on ML for object recognition and navigation.  Furthermore, personalized recommendations on streaming platforms and targeted advertising are powered by sophisticated ML models.  The ongoing advancements in both AI and ML promise transformative impacts across numerous sectors, raising ethical considerations alongside the technological possibilities.  We will delve deeper into these considerations in subsequent lectures.
