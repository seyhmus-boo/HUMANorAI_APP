Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the evolution of cloud computing.  While the conceptual groundwork was laid decades earlier with time-sharing systems and distributed computing, the modern iteration emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Initially, cloud services were primarily focused on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), offering virtualized computing resources on demand.  This model, pioneered by companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) with EC2 in 2006, marked a significant paradigm shift, moving away from the capital-intensive model of on-premise infrastructure.

Subsequently, the cloud matured, incorporating Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) models.  PaaS offerings abstracted away much of the infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on application development.  SaaS, providing ready-to-use applications accessible via the internet, further broadened accessibility and reduced IT complexities for end-users.  This evolution continues, driven by advancements in virtualization, containerization, serverless computing, and artificial intelligence, leading towards more sophisticated, efficient, and scalable cloud solutions.  The cloud's trajectory suggests ever-increasing integration into all aspects of modern computing.
