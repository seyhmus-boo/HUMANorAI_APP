Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources, represents a significant paradigm shift in information technology.  Its evolution can be traced back to the early days of time-sharing systems in the 1960s, where multiple users accessed a central mainframe.  This concept laid the groundwork for the client-server model of the 1980s, paving the way for the emergence of the internet and its associated infrastructure.

The true genesis of modern cloud computing is often attributed to the late 1990s and early 2000s, with companies like Salesforce pioneering Software as a Service (SaaS). This period witnessed a gradual shift from proprietary infrastructure to shared, scalable resources offered via the internet. Amazon Web Services (AWS), launched in 2006, marked a pivotal moment, democratizing access to computing power and storage.  Subsequent advancements, particularly in virtualization and containerization technologies, further propelled cloud computing's expansion, encompassing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS), solidifying its position as a dominant force in the contemporary technological landscape.  The field continues to evolve rapidly, driven by increasing demands for scalability, security, and artificial intelligence integration.
