Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture will briefly explore the intersection of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, in its broadest sense, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Machine Learning, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on the data they are trained on.

This distinction is crucial.  AI provides the overarching goal, while ML offers a powerful methodology for achieving it.  Practical applications are pervasive.  In healthcare, ML algorithms diagnose diseases from medical images with impressive accuracy.  In finance, they detect fraudulent transactions and predict market trends.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on ML for object recognition and navigation.  Recommendation systems used by major e-commerce platforms are powered by ML algorithms that analyze user behaviour.  The rapid advancement of both AI and ML promises to revolutionise numerous sectors in the coming decades.
