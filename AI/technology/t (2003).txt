Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly evolving fields, inextricably linked yet distinct.  AI, the broader concept, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks requiring human intelligence, encompassing areas like natural language processing and computer vision.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on algorithms enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  

Recent developments have witnessed remarkable progress.  Deep learning, a subfield of ML utilising artificial neural networks with multiple layers, has driven breakthroughs in image recognition, surpassing human accuracy in certain tasks.  Furthermore, advancements in natural language processing, fueled by transformer architectures like BERT and GPT-3, have led to more sophisticated language models capable of generating human-quality text and translating languages with unprecedented fluency.  These advancements have significant implications across diverse sectors, from healthcare diagnostics to autonomous vehicles, albeit with ongoing ethical considerations demanding careful scrutiny.  The continued convergence of AI and ML promises further transformative capabilities in the near future.
