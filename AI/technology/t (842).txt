Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has evolved from humble beginnings to its current ubiquitous presence.  Initially, the concept resembled a decentralized, albeit rudimentary, library system: individual servers held specific data, analogous to individual bookshelves in a large library.  Accessing information required knowing its precise location, akin to navigating a vast, uncataloged collection.  The advent of virtualization, however, acted as a sophisticated library cataloguing system, allowing multiple "books" (applications) to reside on a single "shelf" (server), increasing efficiency and resource utilization.  This marked the transition from simple server farms to the beginnings of cloud infrastructure.  Further evolution saw the emergence of service models, paralleling the transition from a traditional library to a modern, multi-faceted information center.  Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) represents the raw materials—the shelves and building—while Platform as a Service (PaaS) offers pre-built tools and frameworks—ready-made displays and specialized reading rooms—and Software as a Service (SaaS) provides directly accessible resources—loaner books or online databases, ready for immediate use. This layered approach, coupled with advancements in networking and data storage technologies, has driven the exponential growth and widespread adoption of cloud computing, transforming it from a niche technology to a cornerstone of modern digital infrastructure.
