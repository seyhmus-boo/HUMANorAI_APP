Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are inextricably linked fields within computer science, with the latter representing a subset of the former.  AI, broadly defined as the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, boasts a history stretching back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, widely considered its foundational moment. Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and knowledge representation, aiming to program explicit rules governing intelligent behavior. However, limitations in computational power and the complexity of real-world problems hampered progress.  ML emerged as a more data-driven approach, leveraging algorithms that learn patterns from data without explicit programming. This paradigm shift, spurred by advancements in computing power and the availability of large datasets, has driven significant progress in recent decades.  Early forms of ML, such as decision trees and naive Bayes classifiers, were relatively simple.  However, the development of sophisticated techniques like deep learning, employing artificial neural networks with multiple layers, has yielded breakthroughs in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing, effectively revolutionizing AI's capabilities and broadening its applications across diverse sectors.
