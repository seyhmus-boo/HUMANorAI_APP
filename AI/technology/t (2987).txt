The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) marks a significant technological leap, transforming transportation systems and societal infrastructure. While the development of AVs is predominantly viewed through the lens of classical engineering and computer science, this paper explores the nascent but potentially transformative intersection of quantum mechanics and AV technology.  Current AV navigation relies heavily on classical algorithms processing sensor data, but limitations in computational power, robustness, and scalability remain.  This research investigates how quantum computing and quantum sensing might overcome these limitations, offering enhanced capabilities for tasks such as real-time environmental perception, path planning, and decision-making.  Specifically, we explore the potential applications of quantum algorithms for optimized route selection in complex traffic scenarios, quantum machine learning for improved object recognition and prediction, and quantum sensing for enhanced precision in localization and mapping.  This interdisciplinary approach aims to demonstrate that harnessing quantum mechanical principles can contribute to the development of safer, more efficient, and ultimately more intelligent autonomous vehicles, paving the way for a future of truly autonomous transportation.
