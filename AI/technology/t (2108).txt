Cloud computing has rapidly evolved from its nascent stages as a niche technology to a ubiquitous paradigm shaping modern information technology. This presentation traces the historical trajectory of cloud computing, examining its evolution from early grid computing and utility computing models to the sophisticated Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) offerings prevalent today.  We analyze key technological advancements that have fueled this evolution, including virtualization, containerization, serverless computing, and advancements in network infrastructure.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the significant shifts in business models, focusing on the transition from proprietary solutions to the subscription-based models characteristic of modern cloud providers.  The impact of cloud computing on various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and manufacturing, will also be addressed.  Finally, we will briefly explore emerging trends, such as edge computing and quantum computing, and their potential to further shape the future landscape of cloud computing.  The presentation concludes by highlighting the ongoing challenges and future research directions within this dynamic field.
