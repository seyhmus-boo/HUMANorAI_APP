Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has evolved rapidly since its inception, demonstrating strong interdisciplinary links across computer science, economics, and management.  Initially conceived as utility computing, leveraging existing distributed systems research in computer science, its development was propelled by advancements in virtualization, networking technologies, and data storage solutions.  Economically, cloud computing fostered a new service model, facilitating pay-as-you-go pricing and economies of scale, impacting business models and organizational structures.  Management studies have addressed challenges in cloud adoption, including data security, vendor lock-in, and the complex interplay of governance, risk, and compliance considerations.  The evolution further encompassed the emergence of distinct service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), reflecting nuanced interdisciplinary insights into resource allocation, software development methodologies, and user experience design.  Moreover, the field increasingly integrates disciplines like artificial intelligence, enabling intelligent resource management and automated services.  This interdisciplinary nature continues to drive innovation, shaping the future of cloud computing and its multifaceted impact across various sectors.
