This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), tracing their historical development and highlighting their contemporary significance.  Early AI research, stemming from the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems. However, limitations in computational power and data availability hampered progress.  The resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributed to advances in ML, specifically deep learning, enabled by increased computing power and the explosion of readily available data.  This presentation will explore key ML algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and discuss their applications across diverse fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.  We will further examine the ethical considerations surrounding AI deployment, focusing on issues of bias, transparency, and accountability.  Finally, the presentation will briefly speculate on future directions in AI research, including the potential for artificial general intelligence and its societal implications.  The aim is to provide a foundational understanding of this rapidly evolving field for a broad audience.
