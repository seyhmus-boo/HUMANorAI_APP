Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the rapidly evolving fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  While AI broadly encompasses the creation of intelligent agents capable of performing tasks normally requiring human intelligence, ML constitutes a crucial subset.  ML algorithms allow systems to learn from data without explicit programming, improving performance over time.

Recent developments significantly advance both fields.  In AI, we witness breakthroughs in natural language processing, with models like GPT-3 exhibiting remarkable text generation capabilities.  Computer vision has also seen substantial progress, enabling sophisticated object recognition and image generation.  Simultaneously, ML has witnessed the rise of deep learning architectures, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image processing and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) for sequential data analysis.  Furthermore, the increasing accessibility of powerful computational resources and vast datasets fuels the development of increasingly sophisticated AI and ML models, pushing the boundaries of what is computationally feasible.  These advancements, however, necessitate careful consideration of ethical implications and potential biases inherent in these powerful technologies.
