Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly expanding beyond entertainment, demonstrating significant interdisciplinary potential.  Their development draws heavily upon computer science, encompassing areas such as 3D modelling, graphics rendering, and human-computer interaction.  However, the successful implementation of AR/VR systems necessitates contributions from diverse fields.  Psychology plays a crucial role in understanding user experience, cognitive load, and the potential for cybersickness.  Engineering disciplines, including mechanical and electrical engineering, are vital for designing comfortable and effective hardware such as headsets and haptic feedback devices.  Furthermore, the design of immersive and engaging experiences requires expertise from fields like design and human factors, focusing on usability, accessibility, and intuitive interfaces.  Medical applications, for instance, leverage AR for surgical planning and training, illustrating the crucial link between AR/VR and healthcare.  Similarly, educational applications demonstrate the synergistic potential of these technologies with pedagogy, creating interactive and engaging learning environments.  The multidisciplinary nature of AR/VR development underscores the necessity for collaborative research and development efforts to fully harness their transformative potential across numerous sectors.
