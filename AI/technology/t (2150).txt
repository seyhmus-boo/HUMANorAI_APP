Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related approaches to manipulating user perception of reality.  AR, akin to adding digital annotations to a physical map, overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real world, enhancing the user's experience.  Imagine using a smartphone app to identify constellations in the night sky; the app overlays the names and details of stars and planets directly onto the view through the phone's camera. This exemplifies AR's ability to seamlessly integrate digital information with the existing environment. Conversely, VR, comparable to stepping into a fully immersive diorama, creates entirely synthetic environments.  Users don the necessary headset and are transported to a simulated world, often interacting with it using controllers or hand-tracking technology. Think of a flight simulator used to train pilots; the entire experience, from the cockpit to the outside landscape, is generated digitally, offering a controlled and safe training environment. While seemingly disparate, both AR and VR share the common goal of enhancing user engagement and interaction by manipulating sensory input, offering promising applications across diverse fields, from entertainment and education to healthcare and industrial training.
