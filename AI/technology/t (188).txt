Quantum computing, poised to revolutionize computation by leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena, faces significant hurdles before realizing its transformative potential.  While theoretical advancements have outlined powerful algorithms and applications, the transition from theoretical frameworks to practical, large-scale quantum computers remains a formidable challenge.  This paper focuses on the critical experimental limitations currently hindering the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.  We examine the persistent difficulties in achieving high qubit coherence times, crucial for maintaining quantum superposition and entanglement, and the challenges associated with scaling up qubit numbers while maintaining low error rates.  Further, the complexities of qubit control and the development of effective error correction codes are analyzed, highlighting the need for innovative approaches in materials science, device fabrication, and quantum control techniques.  Finally, we explore the crucial role of integrated quantum systems, addressing issues of qubit connectivity and the development of scalable architectures that mitigate crosstalk and other sources of decoherence.  Understanding and overcoming these experimental challenges is paramount to unlocking the true potential of quantum computing.
