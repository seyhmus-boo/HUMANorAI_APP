Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  Imagine AI as the overarching ambition: to create machines capable of intelligent behaviour, mimicking human cognitive functions like learning and problem-solving.  Think of a chess-playing computer â€“ that's AI in action.

However, achieving genuine AI is a formidable challenge.  This is where Machine Learning steps in.  ML provides a crucial mechanism for achieving AI.  Instead of explicitly programming every rule,  ML allows computers to learn from data, much like a child learns to identify a cat after seeing numerous examples. We "train" algorithms using vast datasets;  the algorithm adjusts its internal parameters, analogous to refining a mental model, to improve its predictive accuracy.  Thus, ML is a subset of AI, a powerful tool in its pursuit. Deep learning, a sophisticated form of ML utilizing artificial neural networks, represents a further refinement, enabling machines to identify complex patterns from enormous datasets, like recognizing faces in a crowd.  In essence, ML provides the practical engine powering the overarching goal of AI.
