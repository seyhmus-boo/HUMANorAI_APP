This presentation explores the intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart homes through the lens of quantum mechanics, highlighting potential advancements and challenges. While classical computing underpins current IoT architectures, the inherent limitations of scalability and security become increasingly pronounced in the context of vast, interconnected smart home networks. We argue that quantum technologies offer a pathway to overcome these limitations.  Specifically, we discuss the potential of quantum key distribution (QKD) for enhancing the security of data exchanged between smart home devices, mitigating vulnerabilities to eavesdropping and cyberattacks.  Furthermore, we examine the role of quantum computing in optimizing energy consumption within smart homes by developing sophisticated algorithms for predictive modelling and resource allocation.  However, the practical implementation of quantum-enhanced IoT faces significant hurdles, including the development of robust and scalable quantum hardware, as well as the integration of quantum protocols into existing IoT infrastructure.  This presentation will analyze the current state-of-the-art, identify key research directions, and discuss the potential impact of quantum technologies on the future of smart homes and their secure, efficient operation.
