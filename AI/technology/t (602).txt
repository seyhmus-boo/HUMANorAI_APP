Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly evolving, driven by advancements in processing power, display technology, and sensor integration.  Recent developments showcase a shift towards more sophisticated and immersive experiences.  In AR, advancements in computer vision allow for more accurate and contextually aware overlay of digital information onto the real world, facilitating applications beyond simple game overlays.  For example, real-time 3D modelling and interactive design tools leverage AR to enhance collaboration and prototyping.  Similarly, medical applications are flourishing, with AR used for surgical planning and guidance, offering improved precision and reduced invasiveness.  Within VR, advancements in haptic feedback technology are creating more realistic and engaging interactions, improving training simulations in fields such as aviation and surgery where tactile feedback is crucial.  Furthermore, high-fidelity rendering techniques and improved head-mounted displays (HMDs) are mitigating issues of motion sickness and visual fatigue, increasing user comfort and acceptance.  The convergence of AR and VR, often termed mixed reality (MR), is also gaining momentum, leading to the development of hybrid environments that seamlessly blend real and virtual worlds, presenting exciting possibilities for future applications across various sectors.
