Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the broad goal of creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  ML algorithms identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time through exposure to new data.  This learning process can be supervised, using labelled data to train models, unsupervised, identifying structures in unlabeled data, or reinforcement-based, learning through trial and error and reward systems.

The practical applications of AI and ML are vast and rapidly expanding.  In healthcare, ML algorithms diagnose diseases from medical images with increasing accuracy.  Financial institutions leverage AI for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  Self-driving vehicles rely heavily on ML for object recognition and navigation.  Furthermore, natural language processing, a key area of AI, powers chatbots and machine translation services.  The continuous development and refinement of AI and ML techniques promise to revolutionize various sectors, driving innovation and automation across industries.
