Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has evolved significantly from its nascent stages, showcasing strong interdisciplinary links across computer science, economics, and management.  Initially rooted in the distributed computing concepts of the 1960s and the rise of the internet in the 1990s, early cloud services were largely characterized by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), offering basic computational resources on a pay-as-you-go basis.  This model benefited from advancements in virtualization and network technologies within computer science, enabling efficient resource allocation and scalability.  However, the economic viability of cloud computing relied heavily on advancements in data center design and management, drawing on principles of operations research and supply chain management to optimize costs and resource utilization.  Subsequent iterations saw the emergence of Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), requiring collaboration between computer scientists specializing in software engineering and database management, alongside management expertise in service level agreements (SLAs) and customer relationship management (CRM).  The increasing adoption of cloud necessitates further interdisciplinary research, particularly concerning cybersecurity, data privacy (involving legal and ethical considerations), and the societal impact on employment and economic inequality.
