Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, with roots in the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.  Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, achieving limited success due to the constraints of computational power and data availability.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of relying on explicitly programmed rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data to make predictions or decisions.  This paradigm shift, fueled by increased computing power and the proliferation of big data, led to significant advancements.  Early ML techniques like decision trees and naive Bayes were superseded by more sophisticated methods, including support vector machines, neural networks, and deep learning.

Deep learning, employing artificial neural networks with multiple layers, has propelled recent AI breakthroughs in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing.  However, challenges remain, including addressing biases embedded in training data, ensuring algorithmic transparency ("explainable AI"), and mitigating ethical concerns surrounding autonomous systems and potential job displacement.  The future of AI and ML lies in interdisciplinary collaboration and the development of robust, ethical, and socially beneficial applications.
