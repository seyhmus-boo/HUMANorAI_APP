The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology promises transformative changes in transportation, yet significant experimental challenges remain before widespread deployment. This presentation will examine key experimental hurdles hindering the realization of fully autonomous driving. We will focus on three primary areas: 1) **robust perception in complex environments:**  current sensor suites struggle with adverse weather conditions, unpredictable human behaviour (e.g., jaywalking, erratic driving), and occlusions, leading to inaccurate object detection and classification.  2) **safe and efficient decision-making:**  developing algorithms capable of consistently making optimal decisions in ambiguous or rapidly evolving situations presents a significant challenge, demanding robust verification and validation methods to mitigate the risk of accidents. 3) **ethical considerations and legal frameworks:**  the experimental design and evaluation of AVs must grapple with complex ethical dilemmas concerning accident responsibility and data privacy, requiring the development of robust and ethically sound testing methodologies and regulatory frameworks.  This presentation will discuss ongoing research efforts addressing these challenges, highlighting the need for collaborative interdisciplinary approaches encompassing engineering, computer science, law, and ethics to ensure the safe and responsible deployment of AV technology.
