Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the evolution of cloud computing.  Initially, imagine computing resources as a single, powerful, but expensive mainframe – a private island holding all your data and processing power.  This is analogous to early computing, with limited accessibility and high costs.

The next stage saw the rise of client-server architecture, akin to a network of smaller islands, each with its own specific function, yet still requiring significant local infrastructure investment.  This was inherently less centralized but lacked scalability and agility.

Cloud computing, however, represents a paradigm shift. Imagine a vast, interconnected continent offering diverse services – storage, processing, applications – on demand.  This "utility computing" model, drawing parallels to electricity grids, allows users to access resources as needed, paying only for what they consume.  The evolution from a single mainframe to this vast continent mirrors the exponential increase in both computing power and accessibility.  We've transitioned from owning the entire island to renting specific plots of land, optimizing efficiency and cost-effectiveness.  This evolution continues, with advancements in AI and edge computing further expanding the cloud’s capabilities and reach.
