Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating systems that exhibit intelligent behavior, boasts a history dating back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, where the term was coined. Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, achieving limited success due to the computational constraints of the time.  The field experienced several periods of optimism followed by "AI winters" marked by unmet expectations.

ML, a subset of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of relying on explicitly programmed rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data, adapting and improving their performance over time.  Early examples include perceptrons and decision trees, but the field experienced a resurgence with the advent of increased computing power and the availability of massive datasets.  This led to the development of sophisticated techniques like deep learning, employing artificial neural networks with multiple layers to extract complex features from data.  Today, ML underpins numerous applications, from image recognition and natural language processing to predictive analytics and robotics, significantly impacting various sectors.  While showcasing remarkable progress, concerns remain regarding ethical considerations, bias in algorithms, and the potential societal impact of increasingly autonomous AI systems.
