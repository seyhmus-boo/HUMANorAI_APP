This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in leveraging big data within modern industries. While the potential benefits of utilizing vast datasets for improved decision-making, predictive modelling, and process optimization are widely acknowledged, realizing this potential faces significant hurdles.  We will discuss three key areas: firstly, the difficulty of ensuring data quality and consistency across diverse sources, highlighting the complexities of data integration and cleaning in large-scale deployments.  Secondly, the computational limitations and resource demands associated with processing and analyzing massive datasets will be addressed, emphasizing the need for efficient algorithms and advanced computing infrastructure. Finally,  we will examine the ethical and societal implications of big data analysis, specifically focusing on issues of bias, privacy, and accountability in experimental designs and their downstream consequences.  This presentation concludes by outlining potential strategies for mitigating these experimental challenges and maximizing the value extracted from big data initiatives across various industrial sectors.  Examples from manufacturing, finance, and healthcare will illustrate these points.
