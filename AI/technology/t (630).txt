The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) marks a significant technological leap, promising transformative impacts on transportation, logistics, and urban planning.  While the engineering and societal implications of AVs have been extensively explored, a less-considered perspective lies in the underlying quantum mechanical principles that underpin crucial enabling technologies. This research paper investigates the burgeoning field of AV technology through a quantum mechanical lens, focusing on the fundamental physical limitations and potential quantum advantages shaping its development. We examine the crucial role of quantum-enhanced sensors, specifically in lidar and radar systems, which rely on the precise measurement and manipulation of photons for accurate object detection and distance measurement.  Further, we analyze the implications of quantum computing for the real-time processing of vast amounts of sensor data required for autonomous navigation, decision-making, and path planning, considering the inherent limitations of classical computation in handling the complexity of dynamic environments. Finally, we explore the potential of quantum communication networks in ensuring secure and reliable data transmission between AVs and infrastructure, mitigating the vulnerabilities inherent in classical communication systems.  This interdisciplinary approach aims to illuminate the hitherto under-examined quantum mechanical foundations of AV technology, highlighting both existing limitations and future opportunities for advancement.
