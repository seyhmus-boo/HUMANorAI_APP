The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted residential environments, leading to the emergence of smart homes.  This paper examines the convergence of IoT technologies and domestic spaces, focusing on the functionalities, challenges, and implications of this integration. Smart homes leverage interconnected devices, including sensors, actuators, and appliances, communicating via various protocols (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi) to automate tasks, enhance energy efficiency, and improve occupant comfort and security.  While advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence facilitate personalized experiences and predictive maintenance, significant security vulnerabilities remain, including data breaches and unauthorized access, demanding robust cybersecurity measures.  Furthermore, ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and user consent are paramount. This review analyzes the existing literature on smart home technologies, highlighting both their transformative potential in enhancing quality of life and the considerable technical and societal challenges that necessitate ongoing research and development for responsible deployment and widespread adoption.  Future research should prioritize addressing privacy concerns, developing interoperable standards, and establishing robust security frameworks to fully realize the potential benefits of IoT-enabled smart homes.
