Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subfield, machine learning (ML), are inherently interdisciplinary.  Their development and application draw heavily from diverse fields.  Computer science provides the foundational algorithms and computational infrastructure, while mathematics, particularly statistics and probability, underpins ML's core methodologies.  The ability of AI to process and interpret data necessitates strong links with data science, encompassing data mining, cleaning, and visualization.

Furthermore, the design of AI systems capable of interacting with humans requires input from cognitive science and psychology, informing the development of user interfaces and understanding human decision-making processes.  Specific AI applications, such as medical diagnosis or financial forecasting, require deep expertise in the respective domains, highlighting the collaborative nature of AI research.  Finally, ethical considerations, addressed through philosophy and law, are crucial for responsible AI development and deployment, emphasizing the crucial role of societal impact analysis in this rapidly evolving field.
