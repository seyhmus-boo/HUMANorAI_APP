This presentation traces the evolution of cloud computing, highlighting its increasingly interdisciplinary nature.  From its nascent stages as a niche technology primarily concerning computer science, cloud computing has expanded to profoundly impact diverse fields. We will explore its development from centralized mainframes and client-server architectures to the current paradigm of distributed, service-oriented models, emphasizing key technological innovations like virtualization, containerization, and serverless computing.  The discussion will then move towards the interdisciplinary implications, examining its influence on disciplines like economics (market structures, pricing models), sociology (digital labour, social networks), and environmental science (energy consumption, carbon footprint).  We will analyze how cloud-based platforms facilitate collaboration across these disciplines, enabling the development of novel applications in areas such as AI-driven healthcare, climate modelling, and precision agriculture. Finally, we will address future challenges and opportunities arising from this ongoing evolution, particularly concerning data security, ethical considerations, and the need for interdisciplinary approaches to governance and regulation.  The presentation concludes by emphasizing the crucial role of interdisciplinary research in shaping the responsible and sustainable future of cloud computing.
