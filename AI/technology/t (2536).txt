The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a culmination of decades of research in robotics, artificial intelligence, and computer vision.  Early conceptualizations emerged in the mid-20th century, with General Motors demonstrating rudimentary automated highway systems in the 1950s.  However, significant progress was hampered by limitations in computing power and sensor technology.  The late 20th and early 21st centuries witnessed a gradual acceleration, fuelled by advancements in areas such as GPS, lidar, radar, and machine learning algorithms.  Crucially, the exponential growth in processing capabilities enabled the development of sophisticated algorithms capable of real-time environmental perception and decision-making.

This technological convergence has propelled the field forward, leading to the proliferation of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) as a precursor to fully autonomous vehicles. While fully autonomous vehicles remain in development, facing significant challenges regarding safety, legal frameworks, and ethical considerations, their trajectory suggests a transformative impact on transportation, potentially revolutionizing mobility, logistics, and urban planning in the coming decades.
