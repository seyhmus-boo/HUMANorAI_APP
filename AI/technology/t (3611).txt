This review examines the burgeoning field of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, highlighting their diverse functionalities and impact across various sectors.  AR applications, overlaying digital information onto the real world, demonstrate significant potential in areas such as healthcare (surgical planning, patient rehabilitation), education (interactive learning environments), and retail (virtual try-ons).  Conversely, VR, creating immersive simulated environments, finds extensive use in training simulations (flight simulators, military exercises), entertainment (gaming, virtual tourism), and therapeutic interventions (exposure therapy for phobias).  While both technologies offer transformative possibilities, challenges remain.  These include the high cost of development and hardware, the need for user-friendly interfaces, and concerns surrounding data privacy and cybersecurity.  Furthermore, issues of accessibility and potential for motion sickness in VR require further research and development.  Despite these limitations, the convergence of AR and VR with other technologies such as artificial intelligence and 5G promises to unlock even greater potential, leading to more sophisticated and impactful applications in the near future.  This review concludes that continued research and development are crucial to fully realize the transformative capabilities of AR and VR across multiple domains.
