Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  Think of AI as the overarching ambition: to create machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving or learning.  ML, however, is a specific *tool* within the AI toolbox.

Imagine a child learning to identify a cat.  AI is the overall goal â€“ a machine that can reliably identify cats. ML is the process of teaching the machine.  We wouldn't explicitly program "pointy ears" + "whiskers" = "cat". Instead, using ML, we'd show the machine thousands of images of cats and non-cats.  Through algorithms, the machine identifies patterns and features, essentially learning to distinguish a cat on its own, mimicking the child's learning process. This learning, without explicit programming, is a defining characteristic of ML.  Therefore, ML enables the realization of many AI goals, but AI encompasses a broader scope of intelligent systems, including approaches that don't rely solely on learning from data.
