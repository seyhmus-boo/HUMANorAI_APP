Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the evolution of cloud computing.  Initially conceived as a utility computing model in the late 1990s, cloud computing has undergone a dramatic transformation. Early iterations primarily focused on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), offering virtualized compute, storage, and networking resources.  The subsequent emergence of Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) significantly broadened accessibility and accelerated development cycles.

Recent developments are characterized by several key trends.  Serverless computing, enabling event-driven architectures without server management, is gaining considerable traction.  The rise of edge computing addresses latency issues by processing data closer to its source, crucial for applications like IoT and autonomous vehicles.  Furthermore, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning are deeply intertwined with cloud infrastructure, driving the development of sophisticated AI-powered services and leveraging cloud resources for training large models.  Finally, the increasing emphasis on security and data privacy continues to shape the evolution of cloud architectures and service offerings.  We will explore these advancements in greater detail throughout the course.
