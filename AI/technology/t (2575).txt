Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user, has evolved significantly since its conceptual origins.  Early distributed computing models, such as ARPANET in the 1960s, laid the groundwork by demonstrating the feasibility of networked resource sharing.  However, the true precursor to modern cloud computing can be traced to the rise of utility computing in the late 1990s, characterized by the provision of computing resources on a metered basis, analogous to electricity consumption.  Companies like Salesforce pioneered the Software as a Service (SaaS) model, demonstrating the viability of delivering software applications over the internet.  The subsequent development of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) expanded the cloud's capabilities, allowing for greater flexibility and scalability.  This evolution has been driven by advancements in virtualization, networking technologies, and data center infrastructure, enabling the creation of large-scale, highly available, and cost-effective cloud platforms.  Today, cloud computing encompasses a wide range of services, impacting diverse sectors and fundamentally transforming how businesses operate and access technological resources.
