Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly transitioning from niche applications to mainstream tools impacting diverse sectors.  This paper explores the burgeoning field of AR/VR applications, focusing on recent advancements and their implications across various domains.  While early applications were primarily confined to gaming and entertainment, significant progress in hardware, particularly miniaturization and affordability of head-mounted displays (HMDs), alongside improvements in software rendering and tracking capabilities, has fuelled a wider adoption.  Recent developments include advancements in spatial computing, enabling more seamless integration of virtual elements into real-world environments, and the emergence of more sophisticated haptic feedback systems enhancing user immersion.  Furthermore, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) is significantly improving AR/VR experiences, allowing for personalized content generation, real-time object recognition, and more intuitive user interfaces.  This paper will examine the current state-of-the-art in key application areas, including healthcare, education, manufacturing, and retail, analyzing both the transformative potential and the inherent challenges associated with widespread implementation of these technologies.
