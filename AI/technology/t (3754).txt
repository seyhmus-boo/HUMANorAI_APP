Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, presenting significant opportunities across diverse sectors.  However, the successful implementation of AR/VR applications is hampered by a multitude of experimental challenges that necessitate rigorous investigation. This paper explores the key methodological hurdles researchers encounter when designing and evaluating AR/VR systems.  These challenges encompass several domains, including the development of robust and ecologically valid experimental paradigms that account for the unique sensory and cognitive demands of immersive environments.  We will examine the complexities of controlling for confounding variables such as simulator sickness, participant experience levels, and the inherent variability in individual responses to virtual stimuli.  Furthermore, we address the difficulties in obtaining objective and reliable measures of user experience, performance, and physiological responses within these dynamic and often technologically demanding contexts.  Ultimately, this paper highlights the crucial need for standardized methodologies and robust analytical techniques to ensure the validity and generalizability of research findings in the burgeoning field of AR/VR applications.
