Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrency transactions, has rapidly evolved into a versatile platform with diverse applications beyond finance. This review summarizes the core functionalities of blockchain – decentralization, immutability, and transparency – and explores their implications across various sectors.  While the decentralized nature enhances security and trust, scalability limitations and regulatory uncertainties remain significant challenges.  Applications discussed include supply chain management, where blockchain ensures product traceability and authenticity, and healthcare, facilitating secure data sharing and patient record management.  Furthermore, its use in digital identity verification and voting systems offers potential for increased transparency and reduced fraud. However, the review highlights the need for further research in areas such as energy efficiency and interoperability to fully realize the transformative potential of blockchain.  While early adoption showcases promising results, widespread implementation necessitates addressing technical bottlenecks and developing robust regulatory frameworks to ensure responsible and ethical deployment.  Future research should focus on mitigating risks and optimizing existing designs for specific applications.
