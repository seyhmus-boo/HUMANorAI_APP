Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly evolving, transcending entertainment to impact diverse scientific and industrial sectors.  Their efficacy stems from the convergence of multiple disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary research crucial for optimal development and deployment.  Computer science underpins the foundational technologies, encompassing 3D modelling, rendering, and real-time interaction design.  Human-computer interaction (HCI) focuses on user experience, investigating intuitive interfaces and minimizing cognitive load for effective engagement.  Psychology contributes to understanding user behaviour within immersive environments, informing the design of applications that optimize learning, training, and therapeutic interventions.  Furthermore, engineering plays a vital role in developing hardware components, encompassing optics, sensors, and display technologies.  Medical applications leverage AR/VR for surgical planning, rehabilitation, and phobia treatment, while architectural design utilizes VR for immersive visualization and client engagement.  This interdisciplinary synergy is essential for addressing challenges related to technological limitations, ethical considerations, and the effective integration of AR/VR into diverse contexts.  Future research necessitates a continued collaborative approach to realize the full potential of these transformative technologies.
