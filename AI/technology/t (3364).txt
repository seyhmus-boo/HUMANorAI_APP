Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent significant advancements in human-computer interaction, with roots stretching back to the mid-20th century.  Early conceptualizations, such as Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957), foreshadowed VR's immersive potential. However, technological limitations delayed widespread adoption.  The development of powerful computing and display technologies in recent decades has fueled the resurgence of both fields.

AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception.  Applications range from interactive gaming and navigation systems to medical training simulations and industrial maintenance procedures.  Conversely, VR creates entirely simulated environments, immersing users in virtual spaces.  This technology finds applications in fields such as entertainment (gaming, virtual tourism), architecture (virtual walkthroughs), and therapy (exposure therapy for phobias).  While distinct, AR and VR often synergistically contribute to innovative applications, particularly in areas requiring complex spatial understanding and interaction.  Future research will likely focus on refining hardware, developing more intuitive interfaces, and addressing issues related to user experience and potential negative impacts.
