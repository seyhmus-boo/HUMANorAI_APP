This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), tracing their historical development and highlighting their contemporary significance.  Early AI research, dating back to the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, envisioned intelligent machines capable of human-like reasoning.  However, initial optimism encountered limitations in computational power and algorithmic sophistication, leading to periods of reduced funding and the emergence of alternative approaches like expert systems.  The resurgence of AI in recent decades is attributable to advances in computing power, the availability of vast datasets, and the development of powerful new algorithms, particularly in the field of deep learning.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling computers to learn from data without explicit programming.  This presentation will briefly explore key ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, and showcase their diverse applications across various domains.  Examples will range from image recognition and natural language processing to predictive analytics and robotics.  Finally, we will discuss the ethical considerations and societal impacts associated with the rapid advancement of AI and ML, emphasizing the need for responsible innovation and mitigating potential risks.
