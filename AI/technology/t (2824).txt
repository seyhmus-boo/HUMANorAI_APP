Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have witnessed unprecedented advancements, permeating numerous sectors and transforming daily life.  However, despite their demonstrable successes, significant experimental challenges hinder the realization of truly robust and generalizable AI systems. This research paper investigates key experimental hurdles encountered in the development and evaluation of AI/ML algorithms.  These challenges span several critical areas, including data limitations, model interpretability, and the inherent biases embedded within datasets.  The scarcity of high-quality, labelled data for training complex models remains a pervasive obstacle, often leading to overfitting and poor generalization to unseen data. Furthermore, the "black box" nature of many deep learning architectures impedes our understanding of their decision-making processes, raising concerns about transparency and accountability.  Existing datasets frequently reflect societal biases, propagating and even amplifying inequalities when deployed in real-world applications.  This paper will explore these challenges in detail, proposing potential avenues for mitigation and highlighting the crucial need for rigorous experimental methodologies to ensure the responsible and ethical development of AI/ML technologies.
