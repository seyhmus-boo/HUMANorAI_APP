This presentation explores the evolution of cloud computing and the persistent experimental challenges hindering its full potential.  From early grid computing paradigms to the current multi-cloud and serverless architectures, the landscape has undergone significant transformation.  However, experimental validation of key aspects remains problematic.  We will focus on three core challenges: (1) Reproducibility:  Establishing standardized experimental environments for cloud-based research, accounting for the inherent variability in cloud resources and configurations, remains a significant hurdle. (2) Scalability and Resource Management:  Experiments demanding substantial computational resources frequently encounter limitations in managing costs, ensuring consistent performance across scales, and avoiding resource contention within shared cloud environments. (3) Data Management and Security:  The increasing volume and complexity of data generated in cloud-based experiments necessitate robust, secure, and efficient data management strategies, encompassing issues of privacy, provenance, and interoperability. We will discuss existing methodologies addressing these challenges and propose areas for future research, focusing on the development of robust and reproducible experimental frameworks for validating novel cloud computing technologies and applications.
