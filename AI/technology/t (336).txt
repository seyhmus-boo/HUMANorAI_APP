Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs).  The rise of AVs is driven by advancements in several key areas: artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision and machine learning; high-precision mapping and sensor technologies such as LiDAR and radar; and robust computational power enabling real-time processing of vast data streams.  These technological leaps have overcome previous limitations, leading to significant progress in autonomous driving capabilities.

Practical applications are already emerging.  In controlled environments like warehouses and industrial settings, AVs are boosting efficiency and safety in material handling.  On public roads, we see increasing deployment of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), paving the way for fully autonomous vehicles.  Future applications extend to public transportation, offering improved accessibility and reduced traffic congestion through optimized routing and scheduling.  Furthermore, AVs hold the potential to revolutionize logistics and delivery services, increasing efficiency and reducing transportation costs.  However, significant challenges remain, notably regulatory hurdles and ethical considerations concerning safety and liability.
