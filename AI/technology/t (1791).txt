The burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are rapidly transforming human interaction with digital information and environments.  While typically approached from a classical computational perspective, the underlying principles of these technologies offer fertile ground for exploration through the lens of quantum mechanics. This paper investigates the potential for quantum mechanical principles to enhance the capabilities and efficiency of AR/VR applications, moving beyond the limitations of classical computation.  We argue that leveraging quantum phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, could revolutionize areas such as rendering, user interaction, and data processing within immersive environments.  Specifically, we explore the potential application of quantum computing for real-time rendering of complex 3D models, enhancing the realism and responsiveness of AR/VR systems. Furthermore, we examine the potential for quantum communication protocols to improve the latency and security of data transmission within distributed AR/VR networks. Finally, we discuss the nascent field of quantum sensing and its implications for more accurate and intuitive tracking and interaction within virtual and augmented spaces. This research seeks to establish a foundational understanding of the intersection between quantum mechanics and AR/VR, highlighting the opportunities and challenges inherent in this emerging interdisciplinary field.
