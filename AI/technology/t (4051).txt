The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) presents significant experimental challenges, hindering widespread adoption.  One major hurdle is sensor fusion.  Successfully integrating data from diverse sensors – lidar, radar, cameras – to create a robust and reliable perception of the environment remains a complex problem, particularly in challenging weather conditions or with unexpected obstacles.  Robustness to adversarial attacks, whether intentional or unintentional, also poses a substantial risk, requiring the development of highly resilient algorithms capable of mitigating interference.  Furthermore, navigating unpredictable human behaviour within complex traffic scenarios necessitates the development of sophisticated decision-making algorithms capable of anticipating and reacting appropriately to potentially erratic actions.  Finally, ethical considerations surrounding accident responsibility and algorithmic bias demand rigorous testing and validation methodologies to ensure fairness and safety across diverse populations and environmental contexts.  Overcoming these challenges is crucial for achieving the full potential of AV technology.
