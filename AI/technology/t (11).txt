This presentation explores the nascent intersection of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies with quantum mechanics, focusing on potential future applications and fundamental limitations.  While current AR/VR systems rely on classical computation, leveraging quantum phenomena offers transformative possibilities.  We examine the potential of quantum computing for real-time rendering of highly complex and detailed virtual environments surpassing the capabilities of classical algorithms. This includes advancements in realistic physics simulation, particularly concerning quantum effects currently intractable for classical systems.  Furthermore, we discuss the implications of quantum entanglement for creating truly immersive and interactive experiences, potentially enabling seamless interaction between virtual and real worlds with unprecedented fidelity.  However, challenges remain.  The development of fault-tolerant quantum computers and the need for efficient quantum algorithms for rendering and interaction pose significant hurdles.  This presentation will outline the exciting opportunities and significant obstacles inherent in pursuing a quantum-enhanced AR/VR landscape, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaborations to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum mechanics and practical application in immersive technologies.
