The Internet of Things (IoT), encompassing the interconnection of everyday devices via the internet, has profoundly impacted residential spaces, giving rise to the concept of the smart home.  While early precursors existed in the form of automated home systems, the convergence of affordable microcontrollers, ubiquitous internet access, and advanced sensor technology in the late 2000s truly propelled IoT's adoption in domestic settings.  Smart homes leverage IoT by connecting appliances, lighting, security systems, and entertainment devices to a central network, often controlled through a smartphone application.  This enables automation of tasks, remote monitoring, and enhanced energy efficiency. However, significant challenges remain, including data security concerns surrounding the vast amount of personal data collected and the potential for vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.  Furthermore, the interoperability of devices from different manufacturers continues to pose a significant obstacle to seamless integration within the smart home ecosystem.  Future research should focus on addressing these challenges to fully realize the potential of IoT in creating truly intelligent and user-friendly residential environments.
