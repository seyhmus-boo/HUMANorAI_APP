Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrencies, has rapidly evolved beyond its initial application, demonstrating significant potential across diverse sectors.  This presentation will provide an overview of blockchain's core functionalities – decentralization, immutability, and transparency – and explore its expanding application landscape.  Recent developments highlighted include the increasing adoption of permissioned blockchains for enterprise solutions, offering enhanced security and control within established organizational structures.  We will discuss the rise of blockchain-based supply chain management systems, improving traceability and accountability, and the burgeoning field of decentralized finance (DeFi), revolutionizing financial services through innovative lending, borrowing, and trading platforms.  Furthermore,  the presentation will touch upon the advancements in scalability solutions, addressing the limitations of early blockchain architectures, such as sharding and layer-2 scaling protocols.  Finally, we will briefly address the ongoing challenges, including regulatory uncertainties and the need for improved interoperability between different blockchain platforms, concluding with a discussion of the future prospects and potential societal impacts of this transformative technology.
