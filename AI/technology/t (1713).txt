The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a culmination of decades of research and development across diverse fields, including computer science, engineering, and artificial intelligence. Early conceptualizations emerged in the mid-20th century, with General Motors demonstrating a rudimentary automated highway system in the 1950s.  Subsequent progress, however, was gradual, hampered by technological limitations in computing power and sensor technology.  The late 20th and early 21st centuries witnessed significant advancements in these areas, particularly with the proliferation of GPS technology, improved image processing capabilities, and the development of sophisticated machine learning algorithms.  These breakthroughs enabled the creation of more robust and reliable systems capable of navigating complex environments.  The confluence of these technological advances, coupled with increasing societal demands for enhanced road safety and traffic efficiency, spurred a surge in investment and research into AVs.  Consequently,  major automotive manufacturers and technology companies are now actively developing and testing autonomous vehicles,  although significant challenges remain regarding regulatory frameworks, ethical considerations surrounding accidents, and public acceptance of this transformative technology.
