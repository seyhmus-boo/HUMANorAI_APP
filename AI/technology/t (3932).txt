This review examines the burgeoning field of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications across diverse sectors.  While both technologies offer immersive experiences, their applications diverge significantly. VR, creating fully simulated environments, finds substantial use in gaming, training simulations (e.g., surgical procedures, pilot training), and therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD.  However, limitations such as motion sickness and high hardware costs remain challenges. AR, overlaying digital information onto the real world, demonstrates growing utility in various fields.  Examples include interactive marketing campaigns,  remote collaboration tools, and medical visualization for enhanced surgical precision.  AR's accessibility, through readily available mobile devices, fosters wider adoption.  Despite the promising potential, both technologies face hurdles, including development complexities, data privacy concerns, and the need for user-friendly interfaces.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations and exploring the ethical implications of increasingly realistic and pervasive immersive technologies.  The convergence of AR and VR, leading to mixed reality experiences, offers significant potential for innovative applications across various disciplines, warranting further investigation.
