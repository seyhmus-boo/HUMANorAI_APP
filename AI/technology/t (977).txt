Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrency, transcends its origins to encompass diverse applications.  Its core functionality relies on a distributed, immutable ledger secured by cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms. This ensures transparency, security, and verifiability, eliminating the need for a central authority.  This lecture explored several key applications.  Supply chain management benefits from enhanced traceability and authenticity verification, combating counterfeiting and improving efficiency.  Healthcare utilizes blockchain for secure data storage and patient record management, fostering interoperability and data privacy.  Furthermore, digital identity management leverages blockchain's inherent security to create verifiable and self-sovereign identities.  The decentralized nature of the technology also facilitates secure voting systems and transparent intellectual property management.  However, scalability limitations and regulatory uncertainties remain significant challenges hindering widespread adoption.  Further research is needed to address these limitations and unlock the full potential of blockchain across various sectors.
