Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—via the internet, has undergone significant evolution since its inception.  Initially characterized by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), offering virtualized hardware, the landscape expanded to encompass Platform as a Service (PaaS), providing development and deployment environments, and Software as a Service (SaaS), delivering ready-to-use applications.  This layered architecture reflects a shift from simple resource provision to sophisticated managed services.

The evolution has been driven by technological advancements in virtualization, networking (e.g., SDN), and data storage (e.g., object storage), alongside increased demand for scalability, elasticity, and cost-efficiency.  Practical applications are pervasive, ranging from email and document storage (SaaS) to complex data analytics pipelines in research (PaaS) and the deployment of large-scale web applications (IaaS).  The emergence of serverless computing and edge computing further refines the model, enhancing responsiveness and reducing latency.  Future developments likely involve increased integration with artificial intelligence and a more decentralized, possibly blockchain-based, infrastructure.
