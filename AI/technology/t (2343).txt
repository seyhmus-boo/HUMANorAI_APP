This presentation examines the evolution of cloud computing, highlighting key technological advancements and their associated experimental challenges.  From the initial grid computing paradigms to the current dominant hyperscale architectures, the journey has been marked by significant shifts in resource management, data orchestration, and security protocols.  We will discuss the experimental difficulties encountered in validating novel architectures, such as serverless computing and edge computing, focusing on the inherent complexities of distributed systems.  The presentation will explore challenges in reproducible experimentation, encompassing issues related to data consistency, resource variability, and the inherent heterogeneity of cloud environments.  Further, we will analyze the difficulties in developing robust and reliable benchmarks for evaluating performance and efficiency across different cloud providers and service models.  Finally, we will briefly address emerging research directions focusing on mitigating these experimental hurdles, emphasizing the need for standardized methodologies and open-source tools to advance our understanding and practical deployment of cloud computing technologies.
