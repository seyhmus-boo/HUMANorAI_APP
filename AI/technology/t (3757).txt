Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent transformative technologies with burgeoning applications across diverse sectors.  This presentation explores the key distinctions and overlapping functionalities of AR and VR, focusing on their practical implementations.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses; examples include interactive gaming, navigation systems, and medical training simulations. Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, generating a sense of presence through head-mounted displays. Applications range from immersive entertainment and therapeutic interventions for phobias to architectural walkthroughs and complex machinery training.  While distinct, AR and VR are increasingly converging, with mixed reality (MR) bridging the gap.  The lecture will further examine the technological limitations and ethical considerations surrounding the deployment of these technologies, including concerns regarding data privacy, accessibility, and the potential for addiction.  Future directions will be highlighted, emphasizing the potential for transformative impact across various disciplines.
