Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  Think of AI as the overarching goal: to create systems that mimic human intelligence, capable of problem-solving and decision-making.  Machine learning, then, is a crucial *tool* in achieving this goal.  

Imagine a child learning to identify a cat.  AI is the aspiration to build a system that can do the same.  ML provides the mechanism: instead of explicitly programming the system with all the characteristics of a cat (e.g., fur, whiskers, pointy ears), we feed it numerous examples of cats and non-cats.  Through algorithms, the system identifies patterns and develops its own internal representation of "cat," much like the child gradually learns through observation. This is analogous to supervised learning.  In unsupervised learning, the system might be presented with a dataset of animal images and asked to identify groupings, learning the concept of "cat" independently.  Thus, ML enables AI by allowing systems to learn from data, rather than being explicitly programmed, facilitating the development of increasingly sophisticated intelligent systems.
