Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications represent a burgeoning field impacting diverse sectors.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  This technology finds applications in fields such as gaming, retail (virtual try-ons), manufacturing (interactive training), and healthcare (surgical guidance).  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, generating a sense of presence through head-mounted displays.  VRâ€™s utility spans entertainment, therapeutic interventions (exposure therapy for phobias), architectural visualization, and military training simulations.  While both technologies share the aim of enhancing user experience through computer-generated imagery, they differ fundamentally in their interaction with the physical world.  The rapid advancement of computing power, display technologies, and sensor integration continues to drive innovation and broaden the scope of both AR and VR applications, promising significant societal impact across various domains.  Future research should focus on addressing limitations such as motion sickness in VR and the need for more robust and intuitive interaction modalities in both AR and VR environments.
