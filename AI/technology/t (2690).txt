This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, highlighting their increasingly significant interdisciplinary nature.  While initially conceived within computer science and engineering, AR/VR technologies are rapidly impacting diverse fields, fostering collaboration and innovation across previously disparate disciplines. We will examine key interdisciplinary links, focusing on examples in healthcare (surgical training, rehabilitation therapy), education (immersive learning environments, historical reconstructions), and design (architectural visualization, product prototyping).  The discussion will analyze how AR/VR's capacity for immersive and interactive experiences transcends traditional limitations, enabling novel approaches to research, training, and creative practices.  Furthermore, we will address the ethical and societal implications arising from these advancements, including accessibility concerns and potential biases embedded within the technology.  The presentation concludes by considering future trends and the continuing need for interdisciplinary collaboration to fully realize the transformative potential of AR/VR across various sectors.
