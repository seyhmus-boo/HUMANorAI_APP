Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrencies, has evolved into a versatile distributed ledger technology (DLT) with significant implications across diverse sectors.  Its core features – decentralization, immutability, and transparency – offer solutions to challenges in data integrity and trust.  This abstract explores the key applications of blockchain beyond cryptocurrency.  In supply chain management, blockchain enhances traceability and combats counterfeiting by providing a secure, auditable record of product provenance.  Healthcare benefits from improved data security and patient control over medical records, facilitating interoperability and streamlining access.  In finance, blockchain underpins decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, enabling peer-to-peer transactions and smart contracts.  Furthermore, its use in digital identity management offers enhanced security and user control.  While scalability and regulatory uncertainties remain challenges, ongoing research focuses on improving efficiency and addressing these limitations. The potential of blockchain to revolutionize data management and foster greater trust across various industries is undeniable, necessitating further exploration and development of its applications.
