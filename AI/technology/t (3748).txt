This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in the development and evaluation of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications. While AR and VR offer transformative potential across diverse fields, rigorous experimental design faces unique hurdles.  We will discuss challenges related to participant selection and recruitment, acknowledging the need for representative samples across demographics and technological familiarity, and the complexities of controlling for pre-existing biases in user experience.  Furthermore, we will analyze the difficulties in establishing ecological validity, ensuring that experimental findings translate to real-world scenarios,  given the highly immersive and context-dependent nature of these technologies.  The presentation will also examine the methodological complexities of data acquisition and analysis, including addressing issues such as motion sickness, simulator sickness, and the inherent subjectivity in user feedback.  Finally, ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, informed consent, and the potential for psychological impact will be discussed, highlighting the need for robust ethical frameworks guiding AR/VR experimentation.
