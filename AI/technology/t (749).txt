Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet, represents a significant paradigm shift in information technology.  Its conceptual roots can be traced back to the early days of time-sharing systems in the 1960s, which allowed multiple users to access a central mainframe computer.  However, the true genesis of modern cloud computing is widely attributed to the rise of the internet and the subsequent development of virtualization technologies in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  These advancements facilitated the abstraction of physical hardware, enabling the creation of scalable and flexible virtualized environments.  Early examples of cloud-like services included email and web hosting, which gradually evolved into more sophisticated offerings such as Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).  The emergence of prominent providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) in the mid-2000s marked a pivotal moment, accelerating the widespread adoption of cloud computing across various sectors.  Subsequent innovation has focused on enhanced security measures, improved scalability, and the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, further solidifying cloud computing's position as a dominant force in the technological landscape.
