Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined yet distinct fields.  AI, broadly defined, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception or language translation.  Imagine AI as the overarching goal of building a "thinking machine."  Machine learning, conversely, is a crucial subset of AI, focusing on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This can be likened to teaching a child: rather than providing detailed instructions for every scenario, we expose them to examples, allowing them to deduce patterns and rules.

ML algorithms, such as neural networks (loosely analogous to the human brain's structure), identify patterns within vast datasets.  Consider image recognition: instead of explicitly programming rules for identifying a cat, an ML model is trained on countless images labeled "cat," allowing it to learn the visual features defining a cat.  This learning process, often involving iterative refinement through feedback mechanisms, differentiates ML from traditional programming. While AI encompasses broader goals like reasoning and problem-solving, ML provides the crucial mechanism for enabling intelligent systems to adapt and improve their performance based on experience, ultimately contributing to the broader AI agenda.  The relationship is symbiotic: advancements in ML are continuously propelling progress in AI's wider ambitions.
