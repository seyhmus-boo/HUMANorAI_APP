Quantum computing holds immense potential to revolutionize various fields, but its realization faces significant experimental hurdles. This presentation will address key challenges hindering the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.  We will focus on three primary areas: scalability, coherence, and error correction.  The scaling of qubit numbers to achieve computational advantage remains a significant obstacle, encompassing both the physical fabrication of large-scale quantum processors and the development of efficient control and readout schemes. Maintaining the fragile coherence of qubits, susceptible to environmental noise, necessitates advanced material science and sophisticated quantum control techniques, which we will discuss.  Finally, overcoming errors inherent in quantum operations requires robust quantum error correction codes and their efficient implementation. We will examine the ongoing efforts to develop and implement these codes, emphasizing the trade-offs between code performance and resource overhead.  The presentation will conclude by highlighting promising avenues of research aimed at mitigating these challenges and accelerating the path toward practical, large-scale quantum computers.
