Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related technological advancements in human-computer interaction.  Their historical roots lie in early flight simulators and head-mounted displays of the mid-20th century, laying the groundwork for immersive experiences.  VR, creating entirely simulated environments, found early applications in military training and entertainment.  However, limitations in processing power and display technology hampered widespread adoption.

AR, overlaying digital information onto the real world, emerged more gradually.  Its development accelerated with the proliferation of smartphones and improved computer vision algorithms, enabling location-based services and interactive overlays.  Both technologies have seen a resurgence in recent years, driven by advancements in computing power, sensor technology, and display capabilities.  Current applications span diverse fields, including gaming, healthcare (surgical simulations, rehabilitation), education (interactive learning environments), and engineering (design visualization).  Future developments promise even greater levels of immersion and integration into daily life, potentially transforming numerous aspects of human experience.
