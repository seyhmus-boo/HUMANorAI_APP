Blockchain technology, initially conceived as the foundation of cryptocurrencies, has rapidly evolved into a versatile platform with diverse applications extending beyond finance.  This review examines the core functionalities of blockchain – decentralization, immutability, and transparency – and their implications across various sectors.  While cryptocurrency remains a significant application, its inherent volatility and regulatory uncertainties present challenges.  More promising are applications in supply chain management, offering enhanced traceability and security; healthcare, enabling secure data sharing and interoperability; and digital identity management, providing verifiable and tamper-proof credentials.  Furthermore, blockchain's potential in voting systems and intellectual property protection is explored, although scalability and energy consumption remain significant hurdles. This review concludes that while the technology is not a panacea, its unique attributes offer substantial advantages in numerous domains, demanding further research into practical implementation strategies and addressing existing limitations to unlock its full transformative potential. Future work should focus on developing more efficient consensus mechanisms and improving the user experience for wider adoption.
