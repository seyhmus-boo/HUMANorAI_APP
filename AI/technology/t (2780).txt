Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are interconnected yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating machines capable of intelligent behavior, boasts a history dating back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, establishing its foundational goals. Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, achieving limited success due to computational limitations and the complexity of real-world problems.  The field experienced periods of both optimism and "AI winters" characterized by funding cuts and disillusionment.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a more pragmatic approach, focusing on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Early ML techniques, such as decision trees and naive Bayes, laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements. The explosion of data availability and computational power, beginning in the late 2000s, fueled the "deep learning" revolution. Deep learning algorithms, utilizing artificial neural networks with multiple layers, have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and other areas, significantly impacting various sectors.  However, challenges remain, including addressing biases in data, ensuring explainability and transparency in complex models, and mitigating ethical concerns surrounding AI deployment.
