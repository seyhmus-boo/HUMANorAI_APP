Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related advancements in human-computer interaction, offering immersive experiences through digitally enhanced perceptions.  AR, analogous to adding annotations to a physical map, overlays digital information onto the real world. Imagine a surgeon using AR glasses to see a patient's internal organs superimposed on their body during an operation â€“  enhancing their real-world perception with critical data.  Conversely, VR, akin to stepping into a completely new environment, constructs fully simulated sensory experiences. Consider a flight simulator: the user is entirely immersed in a virtual cockpit, receiving visual, auditory, and even haptic feedback mimicking a real flight, detached from physical reality.  While AR supplements reality, VR replaces it entirely.  Both technologies, however, leverage advanced computing and sensory input devices to create interactive and engaging environments with applications ranging from gaming and education to medicine and engineering, promising significant transformations across various fields. The key differentiator remains the extent of immersion and interaction with the physical world.
