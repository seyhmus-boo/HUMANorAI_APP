This presentation examines the evolution of cloud computing, highlighting key experimental challenges encountered during its development and ongoing deployment.  Early experiments focused on fundamental issues of scalability, reliability, and resource management within virtualized environments.  These efforts laid the groundwork for current cloud architectures but also revealed limitations in established networking protocols and data storage paradigms.  We discuss the experimental challenges posed by the emergence of serverless computing, focusing on cold starts, resource contention, and the difficulties in debugging distributed, event-driven systems. Furthermore, the growing importance of edge computing introduces new complexities concerning latency, bandwidth limitations, and the management of geographically distributed resources, demanding innovative experimental approaches to ensure consistent performance.  Finally, the presentation explores the ongoing experimental work tackling security and privacy concerns within increasingly complex cloud ecosystems, particularly concerning data sovereignty and the verification of secure multi-party computations.  The discussion will conclude by outlining crucial future research directions to address these persisting experimental challenges and pave the way for a more robust, efficient, and secure cloud computing landscape.
