Good morning. Today's lecture examines the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).  While seemingly novel, their conceptual foundations trace back to the mid-20th century, with Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) representing an early, albeit rudimentary, VR prototype.  The subsequent development of head-mounted displays and advancements in computer graphics propelled the field forward.

AR and VR, while distinct, are both immersive technologies.  VR creates entirely simulated environments, offering users complete immersion through visual, auditory, and sometimes haptic feedback.  Applications range from gaming and entertainment to training simulations and therapeutic interventions.  Conversely, AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  Applications include navigation aids, interactive product demonstrations, and educational tools.  While distinct, both technologies are converging, with cross-platform developments and hybrid experiences becoming increasingly common.  Their continued evolution promises significant impacts across numerous sectors.
