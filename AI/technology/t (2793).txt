This presentation explores the experimental challenges encountered when implementing and evaluating blockchain technology across diverse applications.  While blockchain's decentralized and secure nature offers transformative potential, practical deployment faces significant hurdles.  We examine three key areas: scalability limitations, hindering the adoption of blockchain for high-throughput applications; the inherent trade-off between decentralization and performance, often necessitating compromises in either security or efficiency; and the difficulty in conducting rigorous, replicable experiments due to the distributed and dynamic nature of blockchain networks.  Specific examples will include challenges in evaluating consensus mechanisms under varying network conditions,  analyzing the impact of different transaction fee models on network performance, and designing controlled experiments to assess the resilience of smart contracts to various attacks. The presentation concludes by highlighting the urgent need for robust experimental methodologies and standardized benchmarks to facilitate the reliable evaluation and widespread adoption of blockchain technology across diverse real-world scenarios.
