This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, highlighting their increasingly significant interdisciplinary nature.  While initially rooted in computer science and engineering, AR/VR technologies are rapidly impacting diverse fields, fostering innovative collaborations and blurring traditional academic boundaries.  We examine key interdisciplinary links, including the application of AR in medical training (e.g., surgical simulations), its use in architectural visualization and urban planning (enhancing design communication and public engagement), and the role of VR in therapeutic interventions for psychological disorders (e.g., exposure therapy for phobias).  Furthermore, the ethical and societal implications of these technologies, requiring input from sociologists, ethicists, and legal scholars, will be addressed.  This presentation argues that a truly impactful understanding and development of AR/VR necessitates a transdisciplinary approach, integrating expertise from diverse disciplines to ensure responsible innovation and maximize the potential benefits of these immersive technologies across various sectors.  We will conclude by outlining promising avenues for future interdisciplinary research in this rapidly evolving landscape.
