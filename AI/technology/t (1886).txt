Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct but related approaches to mediating human experience.  AR, analogous to adding digital annotations to a physical map, overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real world, enhancing perception. Imagine using a smartphone to see information about nearby buildings appear as you walk down a street â€“ this is AR enhancing your immediate environment.  The real world remains the primary context; the digital augmentation is supplementary.

Conversely, VR, like stepping into a meticulously crafted diorama, immerses users in entirely computer-generated environments.  Think of wearing a headset that transports you to a fantastical landscape or the inside of a functioning human heart. The real world is effectively screened out, replaced entirely by a simulated experience.  This complete substitution differentiates VR from AR, where the real world provides the foundational layer for digital augmentation.  While both technologies utilize similar rendering techniques, their impact on user experience, and consequently their applications, varies significantly, with AR focusing on enhancing the real and VR on replacing it.
