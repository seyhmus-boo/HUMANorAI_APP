This presentation examines the experimental challenges inherent in researching the Internet of Things (IoT) within the context of smart homes. While the proliferation of IoT devices offers exciting possibilities for enhanced home automation and data collection, rigorous experimentation presents significant hurdles.  We will focus on three key areas:  (1) Data heterogeneity:  the diversity of communication protocols, data formats, and device capabilities necessitates the development of robust and adaptable data acquisition and processing methodologies.  (2) Experimental reproducibility:  the complexity of smart home environments, including varying network configurations and user interactions, makes replicating experimental conditions challenging, hindering the validation and generalizability of research findings.  (3) Ethical considerations:  the increasing amount of personal data collected in smart homes necessitates careful consideration of privacy and security, requiring robust anonymization techniques and ethically sound experimental designs.  This presentation will discuss specific examples of these challenges, along with proposed solutions and best practices to improve the rigor and reliability of IoT smart home research.  The ultimate goal is to contribute to a more robust and ethical understanding of this rapidly evolving field.
