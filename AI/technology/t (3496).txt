Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrency, has evolved into a versatile distributed ledger technology with far-reaching applications beyond finance. This review examines the core functionalities of blockchain—decentralization, immutability, and transparency—and explores their implications across diverse sectors.  The inherent security and auditability offered by blockchain are particularly valuable in supply chain management, enabling enhanced traceability and provenance verification.  Similarly, healthcare benefits from improved data security and interoperability, facilitating seamless patient record sharing while preserving privacy.  In the realm of digital identity, blockchain offers a secure and self-sovereign alternative to centralized identity management systems.  However, scalability limitations, regulatory uncertainties, and energy consumption remain significant challenges.  While early adoption has shown promising results, widespread implementation necessitates addressing these hurdles.  Further research is crucial to refine existing blockchain architectures and explore novel applications, unlocking the full potential of this transformative technology across diverse domains.  This review concludes by highlighting the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to overcome existing limitations and harness blockchain’s disruptive capabilities responsibly.
