Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet, represents a paradigm shift in information technology. Its evolution traces back to the early days of time-sharing systems in the 1960s, which provided a rudimentary form of resource pooling.  The emergence of the World Wide Web in the 1990s significantly advanced this concept, enabling broader access to remote computing power.  However, the true genesis of modern cloud computing is often attributed to the late 1990s and early 2000s, with the rise of companies like Salesforce offering Software as a Service (SaaS) and Amazon's pioneering efforts with Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, marking a pivotal moment. This period witnessed the development of key architectural models like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS), facilitating a more granular and flexible approach to resource consumption.  Subsequent years have seen exponential growth and diversification within the cloud landscape, driven by advancements in virtualization, containerization, and serverless computing, leading to the sophisticated and ubiquitous cloud environment of today.  This continuous evolution underscores the dynamic nature of cloud computing and its ongoing adaptation to the ever-changing demands of the digital age.
