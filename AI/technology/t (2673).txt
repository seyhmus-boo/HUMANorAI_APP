The multifaceted nature of contemporary cybersecurity demands an interdisciplinary approach to effectively address its escalating challenges.  This review highlights the critical need for collaboration across computer science, law, social sciences, and management to combat evolving threats.  While computer scientists focus on technical vulnerabilities and developing robust security protocols, legal frameworks are crucial for establishing accountability and deterring malicious activity.  Social sciences provide invaluable insights into human factors, such as user behaviour and social engineering, which often represent the weakest link in security chains.  Furthermore, effective risk management and incident response necessitate a strong understanding of organizational structures and business continuity planning, highlighting the crucial role of management disciplines.  Solutions require integrated strategies encompassing robust technical safeguards, stringent legal regulations,  effective user education campaigns addressing social engineering vulnerabilities, and comprehensive organizational security policies.  Future research should prioritize interdisciplinary collaborations to develop holistic and adaptable security frameworks capable of navigating the ever-shifting landscape of cyber threats. The effectiveness of any cybersecurity strategy hinges on bridging the gaps between these disciplines to create a cohesive and resilient defense system.
