This presentation explores the emerging intersection of quantum mechanics and cybersecurity, focusing on both the challenges and opportunities presented by quantum technologies.  The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to current cryptographic systems, as algorithms like Shor's algorithm can efficiently break widely used public-key cryptography.  This necessitates a paradigm shift in cryptographic protocols, prompting the development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, which are resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers. We will examine the diverse approaches within PQC, including lattice-based, code-based, and multivariate cryptography, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses.  Furthermore, we will discuss the inherent vulnerabilities introduced by the potential misuse of quantum technologies in cyberattacks, such as quantum key distribution (QKD) vulnerabilities and the threat of quantum-enhanced side-channel attacks.  Finally, we will briefly address the promising applications of quantum technologies in enhancing cybersecurity, such as quantum random number generators (QRNGs) for enhanced randomness and quantum-resistant authentication schemes.  This presentation aims to provide an overview of the complex interplay between quantum mechanics and cybersecurity, emphasizing the need for proactive research and development to ensure future digital security in a quantum era.
