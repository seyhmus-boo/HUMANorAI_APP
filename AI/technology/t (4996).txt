The proliferation of 5G networks represents a paradigm shift in telecommunications, promising unprecedented data rates and low latency.  This transformative technology is poised to revolutionize numerous sectors, from autonomous vehicles and the Internet of Things (IoT) to advanced manufacturing and healthcare. However, realizing the full potential of 5G presents significant experimental challenges that require innovative solutions. This paper focuses on these crucial experimental hurdles hindering the complete understanding and optimization of 5G networks.  Specifically, we examine the difficulties inherent in accurately modelling and testing the high-frequency millimeter wave (mmWave) spectrum, crucial for achieving 5Gâ€™s speed promises.  Furthermore, we address the complexities of evaluating the performance of dense network deployments and the associated challenges in managing interference and ensuring reliable connectivity in highly dynamic environments. Finally, we analyze the experimental complexities involved in validating the security and resilience of 5G infrastructure against emerging threats, particularly in the context of its expanded scope and increasing reliance on network slicing.  Addressing these experimental limitations is crucial for the successful deployment and widespread adoption of 5G technology, unlocking its full transformative capabilities.
