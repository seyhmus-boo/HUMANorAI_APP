The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a transformative technological shift demanding interdisciplinary collaboration across engineering, law, ethics, and the social sciences.  This presentation explores the crucial interconnectedness of these fields in shaping the successful integration of AVs into society.  We will examine the engineering challenges of developing reliable and safe AV systems, highlighting advancements in sensor fusion, machine learning, and control algorithms.  Concurrently, we will delve into the legal complexities surrounding liability in accidents involving AVs, the need for updated regulatory frameworks, and the implications for insurance industries.  Ethical considerations, including algorithmic bias, fairness, and the societal impact of job displacement in transportation, will be critically analyzed. Finally, the presentation will discuss the social sciences' role in understanding public perception, acceptance, and potential social disparities arising from AV adoption.  By showcasing the interdependency of these disciplines, we argue that a holistic, multi-faceted approach is essential to navigate the complexities inherent in the widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles.
