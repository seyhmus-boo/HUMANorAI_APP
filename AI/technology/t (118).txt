The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly transforming the residential landscape, giving rise to the proliferation of smart homes. This abstract examines the key technological components, societal implications, and security challenges associated with IoT-enabled smart homes.  Smart home systems integrate various interconnected devices, including sensors, actuators, and appliances, communicating via established and emerging communication protocols like Wi-Fi, Zigbee, and Z-Wave.  This interconnectedness facilitates automated functionalities such as energy management, security systems, and home entertainment, enhancing convenience and potentially improving energy efficiency.  However, the widespread adoption of IoT in homes presents significant security vulnerabilities, including data breaches, privacy violations, and potential for malicious attacks targeting individual devices or the entire network.  Furthermore, societal concerns regarding data ownership, algorithmic bias embedded in smart devices, and the potential for increased surveillance require critical analysis.  This review highlights the need for robust security protocols, standardized data management practices, and ethical guidelines to fully realize the potential benefits of smart homes while mitigating inherent risks. Future research should focus on developing secure and privacy-preserving architectures for IoT in residential settings.
