The Internet of Things (IoT), a network of interconnected physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies enabling data collection and exchange, has profoundly impacted the development of smart homes.  Early precursors to IoT in the domestic sphere can be traced back to the emergence of home automation systems in the late 20th century, often characterized by proprietary protocols and limited interoperability. These systems, typically controlling individual appliances like lighting or security systems, lacked the pervasive connectivity and data-driven intelligence characteristic of modern IoT deployments.  The widespread adoption of broadband internet access and the development of standardized communication protocols, such as Zigbee and Z-Wave, in the early 21st century facilitated the convergence of these disparate technologies. This created the foundation for truly interconnected smart homes, where a multitude of devices – from thermostats and lighting systems to refrigerators and security cameras – communicate seamlessly, often through cloud-based platforms, allowing for automated control and data-driven optimization of energy consumption, security, and convenience.  Consequently, the modern smart home represents a significant evolution from its predecessors, embodying the broader potential of the IoT to transform everyday life.
