This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in developing and evaluating augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications. While AR/VR technologies offer transformative potential across diverse fields, rigorous empirical investigation remains hampered by several key issues.  Firstly, the inherent variability in user experience, influenced by individual differences in sensory perception, cognitive abilities, and prior experience with immersive technologies, complicates the establishment of consistent experimental controls and reliable effect sizes.  Secondly, the development of robust and ecologically valid experimental paradigms remains a challenge.  Replicating real-world scenarios within AR/VR environments necessitates careful consideration of environmental fidelity and the potential for simulator sickness.  Thirdly, ethical considerations, such as participant safety and data privacy, demand careful attention during experimental design and data collection. This presentation will discuss these challenges, showcasing examples from existing literature and proposing potential methodological solutions, including the use of standardized protocols, advanced data analysis techniques, and ethical guidelines to advance the field of AR/VR research and ensure the responsible development of these powerful technologies.  We conclude by emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts to overcome these challenges and foster the creation of robust, reliable, and ethically sound experimental designs for AR/VR research.
