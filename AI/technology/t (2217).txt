The advent of quantum computing presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant threats to cybersecurity.  Current cryptographic systems, reliant on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers or discrete logarithms, are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers (e.g., Shor's algorithm).  This abstract examines the key cybersecurity challenges arising from this quantum threat, focusing on the imminent obsolescence of widely deployed public-key infrastructure (PKI).  Solutions necessitate a transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC), encompassing algorithms resistant to both classical and quantum attacks.  This includes lattice-based, code-based, multivariate, and hash-based cryptography, each exhibiting diverse strengths and weaknesses regarding security, performance, and implementation complexity.  The abstract further discusses the challenges in deploying PQC, including the need for rigorous standardization, efficient hardware implementations, and integration into existing systems.  A comprehensive approach requires not only algorithmic innovation but also proactive mitigation strategies, encompassing secure key management protocols, quantum-resistant random number generators, and robust quantum-safe authentication mechanisms.  Future research must address the scalability and interoperability challenges associated with the global adoption of PQC to ensure a secure cyberspace in the quantum era.
