This presentation explores the emerging intersection of quantum mechanics and cybersecurity, focusing on both the challenges and potential solutions offered by this rapidly developing field.  The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to current cryptographic systems, rendering widely used algorithms like RSA and ECC vulnerable to Shor's algorithm. We will examine the implications of this impending “cryptographic apocalypse,” detailing the timelines and potential impacts on various sectors, from finance to national security.  Conversely, quantum mechanics also offers potential solutions.  Post-quantum cryptography (PQC), including lattice-based, code-based, and multivariate cryptography, represents a promising area of research aimed at developing algorithms resistant to both classical and quantum attacks. We will discuss the current state-of-the-art in PQC, highlighting its strengths and weaknesses, as well as the ongoing standardization efforts.  Furthermore, we will briefly touch upon the potential of quantum key distribution (QKD) for unconditionally secure communication, examining its practical limitations and scalability challenges.  The presentation concludes by emphasizing the need for proactive research and development in PQC and QKD, alongside robust quantum-resistant infrastructure planning, to mitigate future cybersecurity risks in a post-quantum world.
