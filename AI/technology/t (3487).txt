The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs), while primarily a technological and societal phenomenon, presents intriguing avenues for exploration from a quantum mechanical perspective.  While classical computation underpins current AV development, the inherent limitations of classical algorithms in handling complex, high-dimensional data sets relevant to real-time navigation and decision-making become apparent.  This review suggests that future advancements in AV technology may critically depend on leveraging quantum computational advantages.  Quantum machine learning algorithms, for instance, offer the potential for exponentially faster training of perception models capable of robustly identifying objects and navigating unpredictable environments.  Furthermore, quantum sensor technologies could revolutionize the accuracy and reliability of AV perception systems, surpassing the limitations of classical LiDAR and radar.  However, significant challenges remain, including the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers with sufficient scale and the integration of quantum hardware with existing AV architectures.  This nascent field necessitates further investigation into the feasibility and efficacy of quantum approaches, evaluating their cost-effectiveness against classical alternatives, and addressing potential vulnerabilities associated with quantum computation within safety-critical systems.  The intersection of quantum mechanics and autonomous vehicle technology promises a potentially transformative impact on the future of transportation, yet careful consideration of these complexities is crucial.
