This presentation explores the burgeoning intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart homes, highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary nature of its development and implementation.  While technological advancements in embedded systems, wireless communication protocols (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave), and data analytics underpin the functionality of smart home devices, the true potential of this technology requires a multi-faceted approach.  We examine the vital contribution of disciplines such as human-computer interaction (HCI) in designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, and the role of sociology and behavioural science in understanding user adoption, privacy concerns, and the societal impact of pervasive sensing.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the ethical dimensions, including data security and the potential for vulnerabilities, requiring collaboration between computer scientists, ethicists, and legal experts.  Finally, we discuss the economic implications, encompassing business models, market analysis, and the influence of smart home technologies on energy consumption and resource management.  By highlighting these interdisciplinary links, we aim to foster a more holistic and responsible approach to the design, development, and implementation of IoT-enabled smart homes.
