Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct but related technological advancements, impacting diverse sectors.  AR, akin to overlaying a digital sketch onto a physical drawing, superimposes computer-generated imagery onto the real world via devices like smartphones or headsets.  Applications range from interactive gaming and advertising, where virtual objects enhance user experience, to sophisticated industrial applications such as remote maintenance and training simulations.  Imagine a technician using AR glasses to see overlaid instructions for complex machinery repair; this exemplifies its practical utility.

Conversely, VR, analogous to stepping into a completely painted diorama, immerses users in fully simulated environments.  Headsets create a sense of presence within a computer-generated space, offering possibilities from interactive gaming and immersive storytelling to therapeutic interventions and architectural visualization.  Consider an architect using VR to walk a client through a building design before construction, eliminating the need for costly physical models. While both technologies utilize similar display and interaction techniques, their core distinction lies in the degree of immersion: AR augments reality, while VR replaces it entirely.  The convergence of these technologies promises further innovation across various disciplines.
