Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have witnessed explosive growth, transforming numerous sectors.  However, the underlying computational architectures predominantly rely on classical computing paradigms, facing limitations in tackling complex problems that exhibit inherent quantum properties. This research explores the intersection of quantum mechanics and AI/ML, investigating the potential of quantum computing to revolutionize these fields.  Classical algorithms struggle with exponential scaling for certain tasks, such as simulating quantum systems or optimizing complex functions, precisely the areas where quantum computers promise significant speedups.  We examine the emerging field of quantum machine learning (QML), focusing on the development and application of quantum algorithms tailored to enhance classical ML techniques. This includes discussions on quantum algorithms for specific ML tasks, such as classification and regression, utilizing quantum properties like superposition and entanglement.  Furthermore, we analyze the potential advantages and limitations of QML compared to its classical counterpart, considering factors such as qubit coherence, error correction, and the scalability of quantum hardware.  This investigation ultimately seeks to illuminate the trajectory of AI/ML in the nascent era of quantum computing, highlighting both opportunities and challenges.
