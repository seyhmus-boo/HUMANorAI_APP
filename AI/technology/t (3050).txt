The Internet of Things (IoT), encompassing the network interconnection of physical objects embedded with sensors, actuators, and software, has profoundly impacted the development of smart homes.  Early precursors to IoT in the home environment can be traced to automated systems like programmable thermostats in the late 20th century. However, the convergence of affordable computing power, ubiquitous internet access, and miniaturized sensor technology in the early 21st century fuelled the exponential growth of the smart home market.  

Smart homes leverage IoT by integrating various devices – from lighting and appliances to security systems and entertainment – into a unified network controllable via a central interface. This integration facilitates automation, remote monitoring, and enhanced energy efficiency.  Data generated by these connected devices allows for predictive maintenance, personalized user experiences, and the creation of sophisticated home automation scenarios.  However, concerns regarding data privacy, security vulnerabilities, and the potential for technological dependence remain significant challenges to the widespread adoption and long-term sustainability of IoT in the smart home ecosystem.
