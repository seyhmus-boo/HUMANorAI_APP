Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined yet distinct fields.  AI, broadly defined, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as problem-solving and decision-making.  Imagine AI as the overarching goal of building a "thinking machine." ML, a subset of AI, focuses on achieving this goal through algorithms that allow systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Think of it as teaching a dog a trick: instead of explicitly instructing each step, you reward desired behaviors, allowing the dog (the algorithm) to learn the trick (the task) through experience.

Different ML approaches exist, mirroring diverse learning styles in humans. Supervised learning resembles a teacher providing labelled examples (e.g., identifying cats and dogs in images), while unsupervised learning is akin to a child discovering patterns in a dataset without explicit guidance (e.g., clustering similar objects together). Reinforcement learning is analogous to training a pet using rewards and punishments to optimize its behavior based on interactions with its environment.  While ML provides powerful tools to enable AI, the ultimate goal of creating genuinely intelligent systems remains a complex and ongoing research challenge, extending far beyond the capabilities of current ML algorithms.  The relationship between AI and ML is thus best understood as a core technology (ML) driving progress towards a larger, more ambitious vision (AI).
