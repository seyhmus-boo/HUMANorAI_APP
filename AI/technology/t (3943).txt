Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, in its broadest sense, encompasses the creation of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms that allow systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on the input data they are trained on.

This powerful combination has yielded numerous practical applications. In healthcare, ML algorithms are used for disease diagnosis and personalized medicine.  Financial institutions leverage AI for fraud detection and risk assessment.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on AI and ML for navigation and object recognition.  Furthermore, advancements in natural language processing, a branch of AI, power virtual assistants and language translation tools.  The continued development of AI and ML promises to revolutionize numerous sectors, though ethical considerations surrounding bias and transparency remain critical areas of ongoing research.
