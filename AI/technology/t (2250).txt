Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent significant advancements in human-computer interaction, offering immersive experiences with diverse practical applications.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  Examples include interactive training simulations in medicine and engineering, where users can practice procedures on virtual models before real-world application.  Furthermore, AR finds utility in retail, offering virtual try-on features for clothing and furniture, improving customer experience and reducing returns.

VR, conversely, creates fully immersive, simulated environments, isolating users from the physical world.  This technology is extensively employed in gaming, providing engaging and interactive experiences.  Beyond entertainment, VR finds critical application in therapeutic settings, particularly in treating phobias through exposure therapy.  Additionally, VR offers cost-effective and safe training environments for high-risk professions, such as pilots and surgeons, minimizing real-world risks associated with training.  The convergence of AR and VR, often termed mixed reality (MR), further expands the potential for innovative applications across various sectors.  However, challenges remain, including cost, accessibility, and potential negative impacts on user well-being requiring further investigation.
