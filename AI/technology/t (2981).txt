Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) represent distinct yet interconnected fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined as the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, boasts a history tracing back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, where the term was coined. Initial enthusiasm focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, achieving limited success due to the constraints of computational power and data availability.  The ensuing AI winter witnessed disillusionment and reduced funding.

The resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributable to advances in ML, particularly deep learning.  ML, a subfield of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Early ML algorithms, like decision trees and support vector machines, demonstrated efficacy in specific tasks.  However, the breakthrough came with the development of deep neural networks, inspired by the structure of the human brain, allowing for the processing of vast datasets and the extraction of complex patterns.  This has fueled advancements in various domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.  Despite their impressive capabilities, ongoing challenges remain, encompassing ethical considerations related to bias, transparency, and accountability, as well as fundamental limitations in generalizing learned knowledge across diverse contexts.
