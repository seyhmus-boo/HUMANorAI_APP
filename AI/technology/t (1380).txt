Cloud computing, once a nascent concept, has rapidly evolved from a simple extension of existing IT infrastructure into a ubiquitous and transformative force. This presentation traces this evolution using relatable analogies.  Initially, akin to a shared office space, early cloud models offered basic compute and storage, a “co-working” environment for applications.  The subsequent emergence of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) can be likened to leasing a customizable office building – users gain control over their environment, but still rely on the landlord for infrastructure maintenance.  Platform as a Service (PaaS) represents a further shift, analogous to renting a fully furnished and equipped office suite, focusing on application development and deployment, leaving infrastructure concerns to the provider.  Finally, Software as a Service (SaaS) epitomizes a fully outsourced model, like subscribing to a shared workspace, providing readily accessible applications without any infrastructure management. This evolution, driven by increasing demand for scalability, flexibility, and cost-efficiency, has profoundly impacted various sectors.  However, challenges remain, particularly concerning data security, vendor lock-in, and the potential for exacerbating digital divides. This presentation will explore these aspects, highlighting the ongoing journey of cloud computing and its implications for the future.
