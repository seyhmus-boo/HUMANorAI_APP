The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted residential environments, leading to the emergence of smart homes. This abstract explores the interdisciplinary nature of smart home development and implementation, highlighting key linkages across computer science, engineering, and the social sciences.  Computer science underpins the development of IoT communication protocols, data management systems, and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms crucial for automation and personalized services.  Electrical and mechanical engineering contribute to the design and integration of smart home devices, encompassing power management, sensor technology, and actuator systems.  However, successful smart home implementation also relies heavily on sociological and psychological understanding.  Factors such as user experience, privacy concerns, data security, and the societal impact of pervasive sensing necessitate interdisciplinary collaboration.  Future research should focus on addressing ethical considerations, enhancing cybersecurity protocols, and developing more inclusive and user-friendly smart home systems. This necessitates bridging the gaps between technical advancements and the humanistic understanding of user needs and societal implications within a holistic and interdisciplinary framework.  Only through such integrated approaches can the full potential of IoT in smart homes be realized.
