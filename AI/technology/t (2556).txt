The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted residential environments, giving rise to the concept of the smart home.  While the potential benefits – encompassing enhanced energy efficiency, improved security, and increased convenience – are widely acknowledged, realizing this potential faces considerable experimental challenges. This paper focuses on these critical hurdles in researching and developing effective IoT-based smart home systems.  Existing literature often overlooks the complexities inherent in conducting rigorous experimentation within a domestic setting, including the inherent variability of human behavior, the diversity of IoT devices and their interoperability issues, and the ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and security.  We argue that a robust understanding of these experimental limitations is paramount for the advancement of the field.  This paper will specifically examine challenges related to data collection methodologies within dynamic home environments, the difficulties in establishing consistent and replicable experimental protocols across diverse smart home configurations, and the ethical considerations surrounding data analysis and interpretation within a context of potentially sensitive personal information.  Ultimately, we aim to highlight key areas requiring further methodological development to ensure the rigorous and responsible advancement of smart home technologies.
