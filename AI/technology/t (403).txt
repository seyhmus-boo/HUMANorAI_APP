This presentation addresses significant experimental challenges in the application and development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. While AI/ML models demonstrate impressive capabilities in various domains, their deployment faces substantial hurdles.  We will explore three key challenges:  first, the issue of data bias, examining how inherent biases within training datasets propagate to discriminatory outputs and the methodological complexities of bias mitigation. Second, we will discuss the 'black box' problem, addressing the difficulty of interpreting and explaining the decision-making processes of complex models, hindering trust and accountability, particularly in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance. Finally, the presentation will examine the challenge of generalisation, focusing on the limitations of models trained on specific datasets to perform effectively on unseen data or in diverse environments, highlighting the need for robust and adaptable algorithms.  These experimental challenges necessitate rigorous methodological advancements in data pre-processing, model explainability, and transfer learning techniques to ensure the responsible and effective deployment of AI/ML systems.  The presentation will conclude by outlining promising avenues for future research in addressing these critical issues.
