Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), while often used interchangeably, represent distinct yet deeply intertwined fields driving significant technological advancements.  AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating intelligent agents capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, relies heavily on ML techniques to achieve this.  ML, a subfield of AI, focuses on developing algorithms that allow computer systems to learn from and make predictions on data without explicit programming.  This learning process, facilitated by statistical models and computational power, enables machines to identify patterns, make decisions, and improve their performance over time.

The practical applications of AI and ML are rapidly expanding across numerous sectors.  In healthcare, ML algorithms are revolutionizing diagnostics, personalized medicine, and drug discovery.  Financial institutions leverage AI for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk management.  The transportation industry is witnessing the rise of autonomous vehicles powered by sophisticated AI systems.  Furthermore, AI-driven natural language processing is transforming customer service through chatbots and powering advancements in language translation and text summarization.  This research paper will delve into the core principles of AI and ML, exploring their interrelationship and examining their impact across diverse application domains, while also addressing potential ethical and societal implications.
