The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly transforming the residential landscape, giving rise to the proliferation of smart homes. This abstract examines the key technological components and societal implications of this convergence.  IoT-enabled smart home systems integrate various devices, including sensors, actuators, and computing platforms, communicating through established and emerging networking protocols such as Wi-Fi, Zigbee, and Z-Wave.  These systems offer enhanced convenience, energy efficiency, and security through automated control of lighting, heating, security systems, and appliances.  However, the integration of numerous interconnected devices presents significant security challenges, including vulnerabilities to cyberattacks and data breaches, raising concerns about privacy and data protection.  Furthermore, the increasing reliance on smart home technologies necessitates consideration of issues surrounding interoperability, standardization, and the digital divide. This review highlights the technological advancements driving smart home development while emphasizing the crucial need for robust security protocols, ethical guidelines, and user-friendly interfaces to ensure widespread adoption and mitigate potential risks associated with this transformative technology.  Future research should focus on addressing these challenges to fully realize the potential of IoT in creating truly sustainable and secure smart homes.
