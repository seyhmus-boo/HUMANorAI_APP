Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the evolution of cloud computing.  While the concept's origins trace back to the 1960s with the development of time-sharing systems, the modern iteration emerged in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Early forms, characterized by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), involved renting server space and bandwidth.  This model, pioneered by companies like Amazon with EC2 in 2006, marked a significant shift away from on-premise infrastructure.

The subsequent evolution witnessed the rise of Platform as a Service (PaaS), offering pre-configured development environments, and Software as a Service (SaaS), delivering applications directly to users via the internet.  This layered approach broadened accessibility and reduced operational costs.  Contemporary cloud computing continues to evolve, incorporating features like serverless computing, edge computing, and advanced analytics, reflecting a continuous drive toward increased efficiency, scalability, and sophisticated functionalities.  Future developments are likely to focus on greater integration with artificial intelligence and enhanced security measures.
