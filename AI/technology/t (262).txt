This presentation explores the intersection of big data analysis and quantum mechanics, focusing on the emergent role of big data within modern industries.  While seemingly disparate fields, the exponential growth of data parallels the exponential complexity inherent in many quantum systems. We argue that the challenges posed by analyzing vast datasets – noise reduction, pattern recognition in high-dimensional spaces, and optimization of complex processes – share conceptual similarities with problems in quantum information processing and condensed matter physics.

Specifically, we will examine how quantum-inspired algorithms, such as quantum annealing and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) methods, offer potential advantages over classical algorithms in handling specific big data tasks.  Examples will include accelerating machine learning models used for predictive maintenance in manufacturing or optimizing supply chains through improved forecasting.  We will also discuss the limitations of current quantum computing technology and the need for hybrid classical-quantum approaches.  The presentation concludes by outlining future research directions, focusing on the development of robust quantum algorithms tailored to the unique challenges of real-world industrial big data, and emphasizing the crucial interplay between classical data science techniques and the emerging field of quantum computing.
