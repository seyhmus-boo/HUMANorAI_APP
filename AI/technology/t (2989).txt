Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have rapidly transitioned from theoretical concepts to transformative technologies impacting diverse sectors. This paper explores the synergistic relationship between AI and ML, examining their core principles, methodologies, and applications.  We begin by defining AI as the broad field encompassing the development of intelligent agents capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, and subsequently delineate ML as a crucial subset of AI that focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  The review then analyzes various ML algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, highlighting their strengths and limitations in different contexts.  Furthermore, the paper investigates the ethical implications and societal impacts associated with the proliferation of AI and ML technologies, addressing concerns related to bias, transparency, and job displacement. Finally, we discuss emerging trends and future research directions in the field, focusing on areas such as explainable AI (XAI) and the potential for human-AI collaboration.  The overarching aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving field and its profound influence on contemporary society.
