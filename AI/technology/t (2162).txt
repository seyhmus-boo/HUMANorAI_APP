The proliferation of interconnected devices within the domestic sphere, commonly termed the smart home, represents a significant intersection of technological advancements and societal shifts. This research paper examines the burgeoning field of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies within the context of smart homes, highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary nature of its development and implications.  The seamless integration of diverse technologies, including embedded systems, wireless communication networks, artificial intelligence, and data analytics, necessitates a collaborative approach across engineering, computer science, and design disciplines.  Further, the societal impact of smart homes, encompassing aspects of privacy, security, energy efficiency, and accessibility, necessitates engagement with social sciences, including sociology, psychology, and policy studies. This paper argues that a truly comprehensive understanding of the IoT in smart homes requires a nuanced exploration of these interdisciplinary links. We will analyze the technical architecture of IoT-enabled smart homes, focusing on data management and security challenges, alongside an investigation into the socio-economic implications of widespread adoption, ultimately aiming to contribute to a more holistic perspective on this rapidly evolving technological landscape.
