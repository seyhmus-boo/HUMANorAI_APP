This presentation examines the burgeoning role of big data in modern industries, focusing specifically on the experimental challenges inherent in its effective utilization.  While the potential benefits – improved efficiency, enhanced decision-making, and the development of novel products and services – are widely acknowledged, significant hurdles remain in translating raw data into actionable insights.  We address three key experimental challenges: (1) **Data quality and preprocessing:** the difficulties of ensuring data accuracy, consistency, and completeness, particularly when dealing with diverse, disparate sources; (2) **Algorithmic scalability and interpretability:** the limitations of existing algorithms in handling massive datasets efficiently and the subsequent need for methods that facilitate understanding and trust in model outputs; and (3) **Ethical and societal implications:** the growing concerns surrounding data privacy, bias, and the potential for discriminatory outcomes. Through a critical review of existing literature and case studies, we highlight the need for rigorous experimental design, robust validation techniques, and a focus on responsible data practices to address these challenges and unlock the true transformative potential of big data across various industrial sectors.  We conclude by suggesting future research directions necessary for addressing these persisting obstacles.
