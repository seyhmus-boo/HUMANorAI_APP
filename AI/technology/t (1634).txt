Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly expanding, finding applications across diverse sectors.  This presentation explores the key distinctions and applications of these immersive technologies.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  Examples include navigation apps, interactive games, and medical training simulations employing real-time anatomical overlays. Conversely, VR creates entirely simulated environments, immersing users in a computer-generated reality through headsets.  Applications range from interactive entertainment and virtual tourism to therapeutic interventions for phobias and training scenarios for high-risk professions such as surgery or piloting.  While both technologies utilize similar underlying principles of 3D rendering and user interaction, their distinct approaches cater to different needs and user experiences.  Future research should focus on improving the user interface, addressing potential issues of motion sickness and digital wellbeing, and exploring the ethical considerations of these increasingly pervasive technologies.
