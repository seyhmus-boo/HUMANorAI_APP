The advent of quantum computing presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges for cybersecurity.  Current cryptographic systems, relying on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithm problems, are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers, posing a threat to data confidentiality and integrity.  This abstract highlights the crucial cybersecurity implications of this paradigm shift.  We examine Shor's algorithm, which efficiently solves these problems on a quantum computer, undermining widely used public-key cryptography like RSA and ECC.  Solutions are explored, focusing on post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, such as lattice-based, code-based, and multivariate cryptography, designed to resist attacks from both classical and quantum computers.  The standardization efforts underway by NIST are crucial in mitigating future risks.  However, the transition to PQC necessitates careful consideration of implementation challenges, including computational overhead and key management.  Furthermore, the vulnerability of quantum key distribution (QKD) systems to side-channel attacks demands rigorous security protocols.  Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration, encompassing theoretical research in quantum algorithms and cryptography, development of robust PQC implementations, and establishment of secure quantum communication infrastructure.
