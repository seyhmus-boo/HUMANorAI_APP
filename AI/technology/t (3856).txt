This presentation explores the future of quantum computing through the lens of fundamental quantum mechanics.  While significant strides have been made in developing quantum hardware,  the inherent challenges posed by decoherence, error correction, and scalability remain central hurdles. We will discuss recent advancements in mitigating these challenges, focusing on novel approaches to qubit design and control leveraging concepts such as topological protection and quantum error-correcting codes.  Furthermore, we will examine the theoretical limits imposed by quantum mechanics itself, exploring the potential and limitations of different quantum computational models, including gate-based, adiabatic, and measurement-based quantum computing.  The presentation will delve into open questions concerning the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers, addressing the interplay between theoretical advancements in quantum algorithms and the practical constraints imposed by the underlying physical implementation. Ultimately, we aim to provide a perspective on the future trajectory of quantum computing, balancing optimistic projections with a realistic assessment of the remaining scientific and engineering hurdles.
