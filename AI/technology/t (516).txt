This presentation explores the intersection of big data analytics and quantum mechanics, highlighting the emerging role of quantum-inspired algorithms in processing the massive datasets prevalent across modern industries.  While classical computing struggles with the complexity inherent in analyzing such data, quantum-inspired approaches offer potential advantages. We examine how techniques such as quantum annealing and variational quantum eigensolvers, albeit implemented on classical hardware for the present, can address computationally intractable optimization and machine learning problems frequently encountered in big data analysis.  Specific examples will include applications in financial modeling, where identifying complex correlations across vast transactional datasets is crucial, and materials science, where predicting material properties from large-scale simulations necessitates efficient computational methods.  Further, we discuss the limitations of current quantum-inspired algorithms and outline the future prospects of leveraging genuine quantum computers for dramatically accelerating big data processing. The presentation concludes by considering the implications of this burgeoning field for industrial competitiveness and the ethical considerations surrounding the acquisition and utilization of large datasets.
