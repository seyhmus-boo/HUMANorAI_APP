The proliferation of big data across modern industries presents unprecedented opportunities and challenges. While classical computational approaches struggle to manage and interpret the sheer volume, velocity, and variety of this data, quantum mechanical principles offer a potential paradigm shift. This research paper explores the nascent intersection of big data analytics and quantum computing, examining how the inherent properties of quantum systems – superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference – can be leveraged to address the limitations of classical methods.  We argue that the exponential growth in data necessitates the exploration of quantum algorithms to improve efficiency in critical areas such as data mining, machine learning, and optimization problems endemic to various sectors.  This study investigates specific applications where quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) and Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), could offer significant speedups compared to classical counterparts, focusing on their potential impact in finance (fraud detection, risk assessment), healthcare (drug discovery, personalized medicine), and logistics (supply chain optimization, traffic flow management).  By examining both the theoretical underpinnings and the practical limitations of quantum computing in the context of big data, this paper aims to delineate the potential and challenges inherent in this emerging field.
