This presentation addresses the experimental challenges inherent in the development and validation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems.  While AI/ML applications demonstrate impressive capabilities, rigorous experimental design remains crucial to ensure reliability, generalizability, and ethical deployment.  We will explore key challenges including data bias and its impact on model fairness and accuracy, the difficulties in establishing ground truth and evaluating model performance in complex real-world scenarios, and the limitations of current benchmark datasets in capturing the nuances of real-world problems.  Furthermore, the "black box" nature of many AI/ML models hinders interpretability and necessitates the development of effective explainable AI (XAI) techniques.  We will discuss the need for robust evaluation methodologies, including techniques for addressing overfitting and assessing model robustness against adversarial attacks.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the ethical considerations surrounding experimental design and the responsible development of AI/ML systems, highlighting the critical need for transparent and reproducible research practices.  The presentation aims to stimulate discussion on overcoming these experimental hurdles and advancing the field towards more robust and reliable AI/ML solutions.
