This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in developing and evaluating Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications.  While AR and VR technologies offer transformative potential across diverse fields, rigorous experimental design faces unique hurdles.  We discuss the challenges posed by the inherent variability of user experience, encompassing factors like simulator sickness in VR and the impact of environmental context on AR performance.  Furthermore, we address the difficulty in controlling for individual differences in technological proficiency and prior experience, which can significantly influence participant responses and data interpretation.  The presentation will critically examine established methodologies, highlighting their limitations and proposing potential solutions, such as the implementation of robust pre- and post-experiment questionnaires, the use of physiological measures to capture subjective experience, and the development of standardized usability metrics applicable across diverse AR/VR applications.  We conclude by emphasizing the need for a multi-faceted approach to experimental design, encompassing both quantitative and qualitative data collection strategies, to ensure reliable and generalizable findings within this rapidly evolving technological landscape.
