This presentation explores the future of quantum computing through the lens of fundamental quantum mechanics. While significant progress has been made in developing quantum hardware, fundamental limitations rooted in quantum mechanics itself will continue to shape the field's trajectory.  We will examine the challenges posed by decoherence and its mitigation strategies, focusing on the interplay between system-environment interactions and the development of fault-tolerant quantum computation.  The exploration will extend to the theoretical limits imposed by quantum speedups, contrasting the potential exponential advantages promised by algorithms like Shor's and Grover's with the inherent resource constraints imposed by quantum mechanical principles, such as the no-cloning theorem.  Furthermore, we will discuss the ongoing search for novel quantum architectures and the implications of different qubit modalities on the scalability and error correction capabilities of future quantum computers.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the broader implications of advancements in quantum control and measurement for advancing our understanding of fundamental quantum phenomena beyond computation.  This perspective emphasizes the crucial role of fundamental quantum mechanics in navigating the complexities and realizing the transformative potential of quantum computing.
