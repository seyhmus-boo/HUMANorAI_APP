Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related paradigms in human-computer interaction.  AR, analogous to adding digital annotations to a physical map, overlays computer-generated information onto the real world.  Imagine viewing a historical battlefield through a smartphone screen; AR would superimpose 3D models of soldiers and equipment onto the actual landscape, enriching the user's experience.  This enhancement bridges the physical and digital realms, providing contextual information and interactive elements within a real-world setting.

Conversely, VR, akin to entering a completely immersive simulation, constructs entirely artificial environments.  Consider a flight simulator: VR immerses the user in a digital cockpit, replicating the sensory experience of flying without the physical aircraft.  Unlike AR's augmentation of reality, VR supplants reality with a meticulously crafted digital replica, allowing for exploration of otherwise inaccessible scenarios or the manipulation of virtual objects in a controlled environment.  Both AR and VR, while divergent in their approaches, leverage advanced computing power and sensory feedback to create novel user experiences with extensive applications across various fields.
