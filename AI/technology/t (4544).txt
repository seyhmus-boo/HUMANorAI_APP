This review examines the burgeoning intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home technology.  The proliferation of interconnected devices, ranging from smart appliances and lighting systems to security apparatus and entertainment consoles, has dramatically reshaped residential environments.  While offering enhanced convenience, energy efficiency, and security features through automation and remote control, the integration of IoT in smart homes presents significant challenges.  Security vulnerabilities, data privacy concerns, and the potential for user lock-in are prominent issues requiring further investigation.  This review highlights the key technological advancements driving this evolution, including improved sensor technologies, advanced networking protocols, and the development of robust home automation platforms.  However,  the lack of standardization, interoperability issues between different device ecosystems, and the complex interplay of ethical considerations related to data collection and usage represent critical limitations.  Future research should prioritize the development of secure, interoperable, and user-friendly smart home systems that address these challenges and maximize the benefits of IoT integration for consumers.
