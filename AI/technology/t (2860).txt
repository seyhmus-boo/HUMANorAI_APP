This presentation examines the escalating cybersecurity challenges facing individuals, organizations, and nations, emphasizing the crucial need for interdisciplinary collaboration to develop effective solutions.  The increasingly sophisticated nature of cyber threats, encompassing ransomware attacks, data breaches, and state-sponsored espionage, transcends the traditional boundaries of computer science.  We argue that effective mitigation requires expertise from diverse fields.  Specifically, we will explore the vital contributions of law and policy in establishing robust regulatory frameworks and legal accountability.  Furthermore, we will highlight the significance of sociological and psychological insights in understanding user behavior and mitigating human error, a major vulnerability in many cyberattacks.  Finally, the presentation will discuss the role of economics and international relations in shaping cybersecurity strategies, highlighting the economic costs of cybercrime and the complexities of international cooperation in cyberspace. By integrating these perspectives, we aim to demonstrate how a holistic, interdisciplinary approach is essential for navigating the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats and fostering a more secure digital future.
