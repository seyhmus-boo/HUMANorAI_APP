The burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) present significant experimental challenges.  One key hurdle lies in achieving seamless integration between the real and virtual worlds in AR.  Precise spatial tracking and registration, crucial for overlaying digital content accurately onto the real environment, remain problematic, particularly in dynamic settings with varying lighting conditions.  Occlusion handling, realistically rendering virtual objects behind real-world objects, also presents a complex computational challenge.

Similarly, in VR, inducing realistic sensations of presence and embodiment remains elusive.  Simulating the full spectrum of human sensory input – visual, auditory, haptic, and vestibular – requires sophisticated hardware and software solutions that currently struggle with latency issues and motion sickness.  Furthermore, designing intuitive and effective interaction paradigms for navigating virtual environments and manipulating virtual objects is an ongoing area of investigation, with concerns surrounding user fatigue and cognitive load.  Finally, the ethical implications of immersive technologies, regarding data privacy, psychological impact, and potential for misuse, require thorough empirical investigation.  Overcoming these challenges necessitates interdisciplinary collaboration spanning computer science, psychology, and human-computer interaction.
