Cloud computing, initially conceived as a scalable infrastructure solution, has evolved into a transformative technology impacting diverse disciplines. This presentation explores the multifaceted evolution of cloud computing, highlighting its interdisciplinary nature.  We trace its journey from basic grid computing and utility computing models to the current landscape dominated by Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), emphasizing the technological advancements driving this shift.  Furthermore, we examine the interconnectedness of cloud computing with other fields.  Its impact on data science,  through the provision of large-scale data processing capabilities, is explored alongside its influence on cybersecurity, necessitating new approaches to data protection and privacy.  The presentation also considers the implications for business models, examining the economic and societal transformations brought about by cloud-based services. Finally, we briefly discuss the emerging trends, including edge computing and serverless architectures, and their potential to further broaden the interdisciplinary reach of cloud computing. The aim is to offer a concise overview of the rich and evolving relationship between cloud computing and various academic and industrial sectors.
