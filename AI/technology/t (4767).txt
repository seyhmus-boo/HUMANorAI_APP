This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in developing and evaluating Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications.  While AR and VR technologies offer transformative potential across numerous fields, rigorous experimental design and data acquisition present unique obstacles.  We discuss the limitations of traditional experimental methodologies when applied to immersive environments, highlighting issues such as ecological validity, participant engagement, and the control of confounding variables.  Specifically, we address the challenges of replicating real-world scenarios within controlled settings, the impact of simulator sickness and presence on participant behaviour, and the difficulties in objectively measuring subjective experiences like immersion and presence. Furthermore, we examine the complexities of data analysis in high-dimensional datasets often generated by VR/AR systems, including the need for novel analytical techniques to address the inherent noise and variability in these environments.  Finally, we propose potential solutions, including the use of mixed-methods approaches, advanced data processing techniques, and the development of standardised experimental protocols to improve the robustness and generalizability of findings in this rapidly evolving field.
