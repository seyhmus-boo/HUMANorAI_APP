This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, examining their practical impact across diverse sectors.  While both technologies offer immersive experiences, their applications differ significantly.  VR creates entirely simulated environments, proving invaluable in training simulations for high-risk professions such as surgery and aviation, offering realistic scenarios without real-world consequences.  Furthermore, VR finds application in therapeutic settings, addressing phobias and anxieties through controlled exposure therapy.  AR, conversely, overlays digital information onto the real world. This capability is revolutionizing fields like manufacturing, where AR headsets guide technicians through complex assembly processes, reducing error rates and improving efficiency.  In retail, AR allows customers to virtually “try on” clothes or visualize furniture in their homes, enhancing the shopping experience.  The presentation will discuss the technological underpinnings of both AR and VR, focusing on their respective strengths and limitations, and highlighting successful case studies demonstrating their transformative potential across various sectors.  Finally, we will briefly address the ethical considerations and future trends in this rapidly evolving landscape.
