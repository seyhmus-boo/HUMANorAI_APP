Good morning. Today's lecture will explore the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and their diverse applications.  Recent developments signify a rapid evolution beyond gaming and entertainment.  In AR, we see advancements in spatial computing, allowing for more seamless integration of digital overlays onto the real world. This is evident in applications like sophisticated medical training simulations, where surgeons can practice complex procedures in a risk-free environment, and in advanced manufacturing, using AR interfaces to guide assembly processes.

VR, meanwhile, is experiencing advancements in haptic feedback technology, increasing the realism and user immersion. This improved sensory feedback enhances applications in areas such as virtual therapy for phobias and PTSD, and in architectural visualization, allowing clients to experience building designs before construction.  Moreover, the development of more affordable and accessible VR/AR hardware is driving wider adoption across various sectors, fueling further innovation and research in this rapidly expanding technological landscape.  We'll be examining specific case studies in the coming weeks.
