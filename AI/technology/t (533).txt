Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) represent distinct yet interconnected fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.  ML, a subfield of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms that allow systems to learn from and make predictions on data without explicit programming. This learning process typically involves training a model on a large dataset, adjusting its internal parameters to minimize prediction errors, and subsequently deploying the trained model to make inferences on new, unseen data.  While various ML approaches exist, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, their common thread is the iterative refinement of a model's performance through exposure to data.  The synergy between AI and ML is profound; ML provides the crucial algorithmic engine driving many advanced AI applications, thereby enabling the creation of increasingly sophisticated intelligent systems capable of addressing complex real-world challenges across diverse domains, from healthcare and finance to robotics and environmental science.  Future research directions involve addressing issues of data bias, model explainability, and the ethical implications of increasingly autonomous AI systems.
