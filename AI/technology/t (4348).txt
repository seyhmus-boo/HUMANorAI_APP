Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  ML algorithms identify patterns and build predictive models by analyzing vast datasets, iteratively improving their performance.  This contrasts with traditional programming where rules are explicitly defined.

The core distinction lies in the approach: AI aims for general intelligence mimicking human cognitive abilities, while ML focuses on specialized tasks through data-driven learning.  Practical applications of ML are ubiquitous.  In healthcare, ML powers diagnostic tools, predicting patient outcomes and personalizing treatment plans.  Finance leverages ML for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on ML for object recognition and navigation.  Furthermore,  ML fuels advancements in natural language processing, enabling applications like chatbots and machine translation, showcasing its transformative potential across diverse sectors.  The ongoing development of both AI and ML continues to reshape numerous aspects of modern life.
