This presentation explores the burgeoning fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), clarifying their relationship and impact.  We can conceptualize AI as the overarching goal: creating machines that mimic human intelligence â€“ think of a sophisticated chess-playing robot that strategically anticipates its opponent's moves.  ML, however, is the engine powering this ambition.  Rather than explicitly programming every action, ML equips AI systems with the ability to learn from data, much like a child learns to identify a cat by observing numerous examples of feline features.  We will illustrate this using the analogy of a self-driving car: AI represents the overall objective of autonomous navigation, while ML provides the mechanism for the car to learn to interpret road signs, traffic patterns, and pedestrian behavior through analysis of vast datasets. This learning process, often involving complex algorithms, allows the system to improve its performance over time without explicit reprogramming, mirroring human adaptive learning.  The presentation will briefly touch upon the ethical considerations inherent in deploying these increasingly powerful technologies, emphasizing the necessity for responsible development and deployment in various sectors.
