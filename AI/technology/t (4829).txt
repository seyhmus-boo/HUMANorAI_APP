Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  Think of AI as the overarching ambition: to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, like problem-solving or learning.  ML, then, is a crucial *tool* for achieving this ambition.

Imagine a child learning to identify a cat.  AI represents the goal of building a system that can also identify cats.  ML provides the method. Instead of explicitly programming rules ("if furry, four legs, whiskers, then cat"), ML algorithms allow the system to learn from examples â€“ a vast dataset of images labelled "cat" and "not cat".  Through iterative processes, akin to trial and error, the algorithm refines its internal model, gradually improving its accuracy in identifying cats.  This learning process, based on data rather than explicit programming, distinguishes ML from traditional AI approaches.  Therefore, while all ML is a subset of AI, not all AI relies on ML.  The relationship is one of means and ends: ML is a powerful means to achieve the broader goals of AI.
