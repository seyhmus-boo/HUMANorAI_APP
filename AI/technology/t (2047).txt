Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct concepts.  AI, in its broadest sense, encompasses the creation of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Think of AI as the overarching goal:  building machines that can "think." Machine learning, on the other hand, is a specific approach to achieving AI.  It involves developing algorithms that allow systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of providing a set of rules, we feed the system examples, and it identifies patterns and relationships within that data to make predictions or decisions.  Imagine teaching a child to identify a cat:  you wouldn't provide a precise definition, but rather show them numerous pictures of cats, allowing them to discern common features.  ML algorithms operate similarly, learning from data instances to refine their internal models and improve their performance over time.  This learning process can be supervised (using labelled data), unsupervised (identifying patterns in unlabelled data), or reinforcement-based (learning through trial and error and rewards). Thus, ML serves as a crucial tool in the pursuit of broader AI objectives, empowering the development of increasingly sophisticated and adaptable intelligent systems.
