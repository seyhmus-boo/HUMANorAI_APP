This presentation explores the emerging intersection of quantum mechanics and cybersecurity, examining the profound challenges and potential solutions posed by the advent of quantum computing.  While promising exponential speedups for various computational tasks, quantum computers threaten to break widely used public-key cryptography, rendering current online security infrastructure vulnerable.  We will discuss the specific vulnerabilities of RSA and elliptic curve cryptography to Shor's algorithm, highlighting the urgent need for post-quantum cryptography (PQC).

The presentation will then delve into promising PQC approaches, including lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, and multivariate cryptography, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses relative to classical algorithms.  Furthermore, we will discuss the quantum-resistant hash functions crucial for digital signatures and message authentication.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the potential of quantum key distribution (QKD) as a secure method for key exchange, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to guarantee secure communication. The presentation concludes by emphasizing the need for proactive research and development in PQC and QKD to safeguard future digital infrastructure against the impending quantum threat.
