Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly evolving, transcending entertainment to impact diverse sectors.  Recent developments focus on enhanced realism and interactivity.  In AR, advancements in computer vision and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) technologies enable more robust object recognition and environment mapping, leading to improved overlay accuracy and immersive experiences in fields like medical training and industrial maintenance.  The proliferation of affordable AR smart glasses promises wider accessibility, although challenges related to power consumption and processing capabilities remain.

VR has seen progress in haptic feedback technology, providing users with a greater sense of touch and presence within virtual environments. This is particularly relevant for applications in engineering and design, allowing for intuitive manipulation of virtual models and collaborative design reviews.  High-fidelity rendering techniques and advancements in VR headsets, notably in resolution and field of view, are contributing to more immersive and less visually fatiguing experiences.  However, issues surrounding motion sickness and the development of robust, user-friendly interfaces continue to be significant hurdles.  The integration of AR and VR technologies, creating mixed reality (MR) experiences, presents an exciting avenue for future research and development, offering even greater potential across multiple disciplines.
