Cloud computing, initially conceived as utility computing, has undergone rapid evolution, significantly impacting diverse fields. This paper explores this evolution, highlighting its interdisciplinary nature.  Early iterations focused on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), providing scalable computational resources.  The subsequent rise of Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) demonstrated a shift towards higher-level abstraction and user-friendliness, fueled by advancements in virtualization, networking, and distributed systems.  This evolution necessitates interdisciplinary collaboration, drawing upon expertise from computer science (distributed systems, security), electrical engineering (hardware optimization, network design), management science (resource allocation, service level agreements), and law (data privacy, intellectual property).  The increasing reliance on cloud services for data analysis, artificial intelligence, and the Internet of Things fosters further interdisciplinary research in areas like big data management, cybersecurity, and human-computer interaction.  Future advancements will likely centre on edge computing, serverless architectures, and quantum computing, demanding continued interdisciplinary engagement to fully realize the transformative potential of cloud computing.
