Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, fostering significant interdisciplinary collaboration and impacting diverse fields.  This abstract examines the burgeoning interdisciplinary links driving advancements in AR/VR applications.  Computer science underpins the development of hardware and software, including sophisticated rendering engines, tracking systems, and user interfaces.  Human-computer interaction (HCI) research is crucial for designing intuitive and engaging experiences, optimizing user comfort, and mitigating potential negative effects like cybersickness.  Psychology contributes to understanding user perception, cognition, and emotion within immersive environments, informing the design of effective training simulations and therapeutic interventions.  Furthermore,  design and engineering disciplines are vital for developing ergonomic hardware and aesthetically pleasing interfaces.  Medical applications, leveraging AR for surgical guidance and VR for phobia treatment, demonstrate the translational potential.  Similarly, educational applications utilize AR/VR for interactive learning and immersive historical recreations.  Continued interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for realizing the full potential of AR/VR, addressing ethical considerations, and ensuring responsible technological advancement across diverse sectors.
