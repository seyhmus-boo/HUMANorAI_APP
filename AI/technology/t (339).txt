The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) presents significant technological hurdles, despite considerable advancements.  Experimental challenges remain prevalent across several key areas.  Sensor fusion, while improving, struggles with robustness in diverse and unpredictable environments, particularly in adverse weather conditions like heavy rain or snow, leading to perception inaccuracies that can compromise safety.  The development of robust and ethical decision-making algorithms constitutes another major obstacle.  Navigating complex scenarios requiring nuanced judgment, such as resolving conflicting pedestrian and vehicular movements, necessitates the resolution of intractable ethical dilemmas within a computational framework.  Furthermore, ensuring the scalability and reliability of AV software across geographically diverse regions with varied road infrastructure presents a significant engineering challenge.  Testing and validation methodologies also require refinement, necessitating the creation of more comprehensive and realistic simulation environments to adequately address edge cases and rare events.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is crucial for achieving the widespread adoption of safe and reliable autonomous vehicles.  Further research and development efforts should prioritize addressing these limitations before full-scale deployment can be considered.
