This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, examining their practical implementations across diverse sectors.  We will delve into the core technological distinctions between AR, which overlays digital information onto the real world, and VR, which immerses users in entirely simulated environments.  The presentation will showcase a range of impactful applications, including the use of AR in medical training for surgical simulations and improved patient diagnosis via enhanced imaging, and in manufacturing for assembly line optimization and remote expert assistance.  Similarly, we will explore the utility of VR in architectural visualization, allowing clients to experience building designs before construction, and in therapeutic interventions for treating phobias and PTSD through exposure therapy in controlled virtual settings.  Furthermore, we will briefly discuss the emerging ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, accessibility, and the potential for misuse within these technologies. The presentation concludes by highlighting future trends and the ongoing evolution of AR/VR applications, emphasizing their transformative potential across various industries and aspects of daily life.
