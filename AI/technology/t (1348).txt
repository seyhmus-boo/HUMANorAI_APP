Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly evolving fields with significant interdisciplinary implications.  This review highlights the crucial connections forged between these computational disciplines and various other domains.  Computer science forms the foundational bedrock, providing the algorithms and computational power necessary for AI/ML development. However, the successful application of AI/ML heavily relies on collaborations with other fields.  Statistics underpins the development of robust ML models, providing the theoretical frameworks for analysis and prediction.  Mathematics, particularly linear algebra and calculus, are essential for model formulation and optimization.  Furthermore, the ethical and societal implications necessitate robust engagement with philosophy and law, addressing concerns regarding bias, transparency, and accountability.  Specific applications further extend the interdisciplinary nature.  In healthcare, AI/ML combines with biology and medicine for diagnosis and treatment; in economics, it integrates with social sciences for predictive modelling and resource allocation.  Therefore, the future of AI/ML hinges upon continued and strengthened collaborations across disciplines, fostering responsible innovation and impactful applications.  The success of AI/ML rests not only on technological advancement, but also on the effective integration of diverse perspectives and expertise.
