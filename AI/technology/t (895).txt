Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations across computer science, psychology, engineering, and healthcare.  This abstract explores the burgeoning intersection of these fields, highlighting key applications and challenges.  Computer science underpins the development of AR/VR systems, focusing on rendering, tracking, and user interface design.  Psychology plays a crucial role in understanding user experience, immersion, and the cognitive effects of these immersive technologies, informing the design of effective and engaging applications.  Engineering contributes to the development of hardware components, including head-mounted displays and haptic feedback systems, optimizing performance and comfort.  Furthermore, healthcare benefits from AR/VR's potential in surgical planning, rehabilitation therapy, and phobia treatment, showcasing the therapeutic efficacy of immersive environments. However, challenges remain, including the need for robust user interface design to mitigate cybersickness, addressing ethical concerns surrounding data privacy and accessibility, and exploring the long-term physiological and psychological effects of extended AR/VR use.  Future research should prioritize the integration of diverse disciplinary perspectives to maximize the potential of AR/VR while mitigating potential risks, fostering a responsible and beneficial integration into society.
