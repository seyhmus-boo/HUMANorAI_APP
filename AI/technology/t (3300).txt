Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly expanding beyond entertainment, demonstrating significant potential across diverse interdisciplinary fields.  This abstract highlights the increasingly crucial interdisciplinary nature of AR/VR research and development.  Effective implementation necessitates collaboration between computer scientists, specializing in areas such as 3D modeling, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence; engineers, focusing on hardware development and system integration; and specialists from application domains, including medicine, education, and engineering.  In medicine, AR/VR aids surgical planning, rehabilitation, and phobia treatment, leveraging expertise in medical imaging and psychology. Educational applications benefit from collaborations with educational psychologists and curriculum designers to create immersive and engaging learning environments. Engineering applications, spanning design visualization and remote collaboration, require input from design engineers and communication specialists.  The success of AR/VR hinges on bridging the gap between technological advancements and the specific needs of diverse user groups, thereby underscoring the paramount importance of interdisciplinary research for responsible innovation and impactful application across sectors.  Future research should prioritize the ethical considerations and societal implications inherent in these powerful technologies.
