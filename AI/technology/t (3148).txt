Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, transitioning from niche entertainment applications to impactful tools across diverse sectors. This research paper explores the burgeoning field of AR/VR applications, highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary collaborations driving their development and deployment.  The convergence of computer science, encompassing areas such as graphics rendering, human-computer interaction, and artificial intelligence, is paramount.  However, the successful implementation of AR/VR systems necessitates contributions from other fields.  Psychology plays a vital role in understanding user experience, cognitive load, and potential psychological effects.  Design, encompassing both user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, is critical for creating intuitive and engaging interfaces.  Furthermore, the application of AR/VR in specific sectors, such as healthcare, education, and engineering, requires collaboration with medical professionals, educators, and engineers respectively, to tailor systems to their unique needs and contexts.  This paper will analyze the interdisciplinary nature of AR/VR development, examine successful examples of cross-disciplinary collaboration, and discuss the challenges and future directions of this rapidly expanding field.
