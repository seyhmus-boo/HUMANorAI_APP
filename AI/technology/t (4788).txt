The burgeoning field of quantum computing presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant cybersecurity challenges.  Existing cryptographic systems, reliant on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithm problems, are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers. This review examines the critical vulnerabilities arising from Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm, highlighting their potential to compromise widely used public-key infrastructure and symmetric encryption, respectively.  Solutions are explored, focusing primarily on the development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC).  The review assesses the progress made in developing alternative algorithms, such as lattice-based, code-based, multivariate, and hash-based cryptography, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses in terms of security, efficiency, and implementation complexity.  While PQC offers a promising pathway towards quantum-resistant cryptography, standardization efforts and the migration to these new algorithms present considerable logistical and practical challenges.  Further research into quantum-safe hardware and protocols is imperative, alongside continued evaluation of the long-term security guarantees offered by PQC against future advancements in quantum algorithms and cryptanalysis.  Ultimately, a multi-faceted approach encompassing algorithm development, standardization, and robust implementation is essential to securing the digital landscape in the quantum era.
