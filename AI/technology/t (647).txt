Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms, while classically implemented, are fundamentally limited by the computational complexity arising from the exponential scaling of classical bits.  This limitation motivates the exploration of quantum-enhanced AI and ML, leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena for potential speedups.  This abstract explores the intersection of these fields, highlighting key areas of investigation. Quantum machine learning algorithms, such as Quantum Support Vector Machines and Variational Quantum Eigensolver-based classifiers, promise improved performance in specific tasks compared to their classical counterparts.  The inherent parallelism and superposition of quantum states offer the potential for faster training and improved generalization capabilities, particularly in high-dimensional data spaces.  However, challenges remain, including the development of robust quantum hardware with sufficient qubit coherence times and the design of efficient quantum algorithms that translate classical ML concepts into the quantum realm.  Future research necessitates a deeper understanding of the quantum-classical hybrid approaches, bridging the gap between existing classical algorithms and the capabilities of nascent quantum computers.  Exploring the fundamental limits imposed by quantum mechanics on the achievable performance of AI and ML remains a crucial area of investigation.
