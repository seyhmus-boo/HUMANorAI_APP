Cloud computing has rapidly evolved from a niche technology to a ubiquitous infrastructure underpinning modern digital societies.  This presentation traces the key stages of this evolution, highlighting the significant technological advancements and shifts in service models.  We begin by examining the early days of grid computing and the emergence of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), focusing on the pivotal role of virtualization and the subsequent commoditization of computing resources.  The presentation then explores the rise of Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), analyzing their impact on software development lifecycles and business models.  Furthermore, we discuss the increasing importance of serverless computing, edge computing, and the convergence of cloud and AI, underscoring the impact on data processing and application deployment.  Finally, we consider the future trajectory of cloud computing, examining emerging trends such as quantum computing integration and the ongoing challenges related to security, data privacy, and sustainability.  The presentation concludes by emphasizing the continuous adaptation and innovation characterizing the dynamic landscape of cloud computing.
