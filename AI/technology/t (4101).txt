While seemingly unrelated, quantum mechanics subtly underpins the rise of autonomous vehicles.  The precise control demanded by self-driving systems relies heavily on advanced sensor technology, particularly LiDAR and radar.  These systems generate vast quantities of data, processed using algorithms leveraging quantum-inspired optimization techniques.  Quantum annealing, for example, can improve the efficiency of route planning algorithms by exploring a larger solution space more effectively than classical methods.  Furthermore, the development of more powerful and energy-efficient computing hardware, crucial for real-time processing of sensor data,  benefits from ongoing research into quantum computing architectures.  While fully quantum-powered autonomous vehicles are still a distant prospect, the underlying principles and advancements in quantum information science are demonstrably contributing to the improved efficiency, robustness, and overall feasibility of this rapidly evolving technology.  Therefore, a complete understanding of this technological leap requires acknowledging its subtle but significant quantum connections.
