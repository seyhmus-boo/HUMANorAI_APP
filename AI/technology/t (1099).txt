Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications represent a rapidly evolving field with significant interdisciplinary links.  Their development necessitates expertise from computer science, encompassing areas like 3D modelling, graphics rendering, and human-computer interaction.  Psychology plays a crucial role in understanding user experience, particularly concerning presence, immersion, and the psychological impact of simulated environments.  Engineering contributes to the design and development of hardware, including head-mounted displays, sensors, and tracking systems.  Furthermore,  design disciplines inform the user interface and user experience (UI/UX), ensuring intuitive and engaging interactions.  Finally, fields like medicine (surgical simulation, rehabilitation) and education (interactive learning environments) demonstrate the practical applications and the multidisciplinary nature of AR/VR technology.  The effective integration of these diverse perspectives is paramount for the creation of successful and impactful AR/VR systems.  Future advancements will likely necessitate even closer collaboration across these fields.
