Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have rapidly transitioned from theoretical concepts to transformative technologies impacting diverse sectors. This paper explores the synergistic relationship between AI and ML, examining their foundational principles and the expanding scope of their applications.  While AI broadly encompasses the simulation of human intelligence in machines, ML constitutes a crucial subset focusing on algorithms that enable systems to learn from and make predictions based on data without explicit programming.  This review analyzes the key algorithms driving advancements in ML, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques, and their contributions to various AI applications.  Furthermore, we delve into the ethical considerations arising from the increasing autonomy and sophistication of AI systems, addressing concerns related to bias, transparency, and accountability.  The paper concludes by examining future research directions, highlighting the potential of hybrid AI-ML approaches and the ongoing need to develop robust methodologies for mitigating risks associated with widespread AI deployment.  This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of AI and ML, underscoring their transformative potential while acknowledging the associated challenges.
