Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning fields of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).  While seemingly novel, their conceptual foundations trace back decades.  Early VR explorations, stemming from Ivan Sutherland's "The Ultimate Display" in the 1960s, focused on immersive, simulated environments.  However, technological limitations hindered widespread adoption.  Similarly, AR's conceptual roots lie in the 1957 Sensorama, a multi-sensory experience.

The past two decades have witnessed exponential growth, fuelled by advancements in computing power, display technology, and sensor integration.  AR, overlaying digital information onto the real world, finds applications in navigation, gaming, and industrial maintenance.  Google Glass and Pok√©mon Go represent key milestones in consumer AR.  Conversely, VR, generating entirely synthetic environments, has gained traction in gaming, training simulations (e.g., flight simulators), and therapeutic applications.  Oculus Rift and the HTC Vive were pivotal in popularizing consumer VR.  While challenges remain in areas such as latency and cost-effectiveness, the future of AR and VR appears exceedingly bright, promising transformative impacts across numerous sectors.
