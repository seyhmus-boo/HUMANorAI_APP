This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on their practical applications across diverse sectors.  We will explore the fundamental differences between AI and ML, clarifying the relationship between these often-interchangeable terms.  The presentation will then delve into specific ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, illustrating their capabilities with real-world examples.  

Practical applications will be showcased across various domains.  We will examine the impact of ML in healthcare, highlighting its role in disease prediction and drug discovery.  Further, we will discuss its application in finance, particularly in fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  The transformative potential of AI and ML in optimizing industrial processes, including predictive maintenance and supply chain management, will also be addressed.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the ethical considerations and potential societal impact of these rapidly evolving technologies, including issues of bias and transparency.  The presentation aims to provide a balanced and accessible introduction to this rapidly developing field, emphasizing its profound implications for the future.
