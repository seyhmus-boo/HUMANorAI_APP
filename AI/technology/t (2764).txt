Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications hold immense potential across diverse fields, but their widespread adoption is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  This abstract focuses on key limitations hindering robust scientific investigation.  A primary challenge lies in standardizing hardware and software across studies, leading to difficulties in comparing and replicating findings.  The inherent subjectivity of user experience presents another hurdle, requiring rigorous methodologies to objectively quantify effects such as presence, immersion, and cybersickness.  Furthermore, ecological validity often suffers; controlled laboratory environments may not accurately reflect real-world application scenarios, potentially biasing results.  Controlling for individual differences in user characteristics (e.g., visual acuity, motion sickness susceptibility, prior experience) is crucial yet complex. Finally, ethical considerations, including data privacy and the potential for adverse psychological effects, demand careful attention in experimental design and participant recruitment.  Addressing these challenges through rigorous methodological advancements and the development of standardized protocols is vital for advancing the scientific understanding and effective deployment of AR and VR technologies.
