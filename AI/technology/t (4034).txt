This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on their practical applications across diverse sectors.  We will begin by differentiating AI and ML, clarifying the relationship between these rapidly evolving fields and highlighting key concepts such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The core of the presentation will explore the transformative impact of AI/ML in various domains.  Examples will include advancements in medical diagnosis leveraging image recognition and predictive modeling for improved patient outcomes, the optimization of supply chains through predictive analytics and demand forecasting, and the personalization of user experiences in online platforms via recommendation systems.  Furthermore, we will briefly discuss ethical considerations surrounding AI/ML deployment, including bias mitigation and data privacy concerns.  Finally, we will conclude by offering a perspective on future trends and potential challenges within this rapidly evolving technological landscape, focusing on the increasing importance of explainable AI and the potential for human-AI collaboration.
