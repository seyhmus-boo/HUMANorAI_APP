Good morning. Today's lecture explores the intrinsically interdisciplinary nature of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  While often conflated, AI represents the broader goal of creating intelligent agents, while ML provides a crucial subset of techniques to achieve this.  This necessitates collaboration across diverse fields.

Computer science underpins the algorithmic foundations of both AI and ML, providing the computational infrastructure and theoretical frameworks.  However,  mathematics, particularly statistics and linear algebra, are indispensable for developing ML models, analyzing their performance, and optimizing their parameters.  Furthermore,  neuroscience offers insights into biological neural networks, inspiring the development of artificial neural networks â€“ a cornerstone of contemporary ML.

The applications of AI and ML further extend the interdisciplinary scope.  From natural language processing drawing upon linguistics and cognitive science to computer vision leveraging optics and image processing,  the impact spans various domains.  Ethical considerations, debated by philosophers and legal scholars, are paramount, ensuring responsible development and deployment.  Therefore, understanding AI and ML necessitates a holistic approach, acknowledging the crucial interplay of diverse disciplines.
