Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs).  The rise of AVs is predicated on significant advancements in several key areas:  computer vision, sensor technology, machine learning, and high-performance computing.  These advancements have enabled the development of systems capable of perceiving their environment, making decisions, and executing actions without human intervention.  

Practical applications are already emerging across diverse sectors.  In logistics, autonomous trucking promises to increase efficiency and reduce transportation costs through continuous operation and optimized routes.  The potential for improved safety in passenger vehicles, through the elimination of human error, is a significant driver of research and development.  Furthermore, AVs offer solutions for addressing mobility challenges faced by elderly or disabled populations.  While significant hurdles remain, including regulatory frameworks and public acceptance, the trajectory of AV development indicates a transformative impact on transportation in the coming decades.  Future lectures will delve into the technical and societal implications of this rapidly evolving technology.
