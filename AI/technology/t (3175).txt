The burgeoning field of smart homes, enabled by the Internet of Things (IoT), represents a fascinating intersection of several disciplines.  This review examines the interdisciplinary nature of IoT implementation within the domestic sphere.  Computer science underpins the technological foundation, encompassing network architecture, data security, and the development of embedded systems for various smart appliances.  Electrical engineering plays a crucial role in the design and integration of hardware, from sensor technology to energy management systems.  However, the success of smart homes extends beyond the technical realm.  Human-computer interaction (HCI) is critical in designing user-friendly interfaces and ensuring seamless integration with user lifestyles and preferences.  Furthermore, social sciences, particularly sociology and economics, are vital for understanding user adoption patterns, evaluating the societal impact of ubiquitous computing, and addressing issues of data privacy and security.  Architectural design also contributes, influencing the physical space's adaptation to smart technology integration.  Ultimately, the successful deployment of IoT in smart homes requires a holistic, interdisciplinary approach, transcending the limitations of a purely technological perspective.  Future research should focus on bridging these disciplinary gaps to foster a more user-centered, ethical, and sustainable smart home environment.
