This presentation examines the experimental challenges inherent in researching Internet of Things (IoT) deployments within the context of smart homes.  While the potential benefits of interconnected home appliances and automated systems are widely acknowledged, rigorous empirical investigation faces significant hurdles.  We will discuss three key challenges:  first, the heterogeneity of IoT devices, encompassing diverse communication protocols, security standards, and data formats, complicates data acquisition and analysis.  Second, the inherent complexity of smart home environments, with numerous interacting components and dynamic user behaviour, necessitates robust experimental designs to isolate causal relationships and avoid confounding factors.  Finally, ethical considerations related to data privacy and security demand careful attention in experimental protocols, necessitating informed consent and data anonymization strategies.  This presentation will present case studies illustrating these challenges, focusing on our own experiences conducting experiments on smart home energy management and security systems.  We will conclude by outlining potential methodological approaches to address these challenges and foster more robust and ethical research in the field of IoT and smart homes.
