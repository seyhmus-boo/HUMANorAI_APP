This presentation addresses the formidable experimental challenges hindering the realization of fault-tolerant, large-scale quantum computers.  While theoretical advancements continue to pave the way for powerful quantum algorithms, significant hurdles remain in the physical implementation of qubits and the construction of robust quantum systems. We will examine key limitations across diverse qubit platforms, including superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and neutral atoms.  Specifically, we will discuss the challenges of achieving high qubit coherence times, minimizing crosstalk and noise, and scaling up the number of qubits while maintaining fidelity.  The difficulties associated with qubit initialization, measurement, and gate implementation will also be explored, highlighting the impact of environmental decoherence and the need for advanced error correction codes. Finally, the presentation will touch upon the ongoing development of novel materials and architectures aimed at mitigating these experimental roadblocks and accelerating progress towards a practical quantum computing era.  We will conclude by outlining promising research directions crucial for overcoming these challenges and ushering in the next generation of quantum technologies.
