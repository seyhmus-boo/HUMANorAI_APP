Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications represent a rapidly evolving technological landscape with significant implications across diverse sectors.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception and interaction, while VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments.  This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of these technologies, focusing on their distinct affordances and overlapping functionalities.  AR applications, leveraging computer vision and sensor technologies, find utility in areas like interactive training simulations, navigation systems, and product visualization.  Conversely, VR, reliant on head-mounted displays and haptic feedback, offers unparalleled immersive experiences for gaming, medical training, and therapeutic interventions.  The convergence of these technologies, exemplified by mixed reality (MR), blurs the lines between physical and digital realms, fostering novel interactive paradigms.  Further research is needed to fully understand the cognitive and psychological effects of prolonged exposure to these environments, along with the ethical considerations surrounding their increasing integration into daily life.  This exploration aims to provide a foundational framework for understanding the potential and limitations of AR and VR applications in shaping future human-computer interaction.
