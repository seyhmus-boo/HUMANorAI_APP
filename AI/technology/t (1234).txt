This review examines the burgeoning fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), highlighting their significant impact across diverse sectors.  AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating intelligent agents, leverages ML algorithms – a subset focused on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming – to achieve its objectives.  The review analyzes key ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, discussing their strengths, limitations, and applications.  Significant advancements in deep learning, particularly convolutional and recurrent neural networks, have propelled AI capabilities, enabling breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.  However, ethical concerns surrounding bias in algorithms, data privacy, and the potential for job displacement warrant critical consideration.  Future research directions include improving explainability and transparency in AI systems, addressing robustness challenges, and fostering responsible AI development.  Overall, AI and ML represent transformative technologies with immense potential, yet their deployment necessitates careful ethical and societal consideration to maximize benefits and mitigate risks.
