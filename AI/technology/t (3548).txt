Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the burgeoning fields of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) and their diverse applications.  AR overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real world, enhancing our perception of reality.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, creating a sense of presence within a digital space.

Practical applications span numerous sectors.  In healthcare, AR assists surgeons with real-time anatomical overlays during procedures, while VR facilitates exposure therapy for phobias.  In engineering and design, AR allows for interactive 3D model visualization and manipulation, streamlining the prototyping process.  VR, meanwhile, is employed in training simulations for high-risk scenarios, such as flight training or disaster response.  Furthermore, both technologies find applications in entertainment, with immersive gaming and interactive storytelling experiences gaining widespread popularity. The continued development and refinement of AR and VR technologies promise even more transformative applications across various disciplines in the coming years.
