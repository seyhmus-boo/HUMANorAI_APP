Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly expanding their application domains, moving beyond entertainment and into diverse sectors.  This burgeoning field leverages advancements in computer vision, sensor technology, and display systems to create immersive experiences.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through real-time interaction with superimposed digital content.  Applications range from interactive training simulations in medicine and engineering to enhancing retail experiences through virtual try-on capabilities. Conversely, VR creates entirely simulated environments, offering users complete immersion in a computer-generated world.  This technology finds utility in areas such as architectural visualization, therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD, and interactive gaming. While both technologies offer significant advantages, limitations exist.  High computational demands, cost considerations for hardware and development, and potential issues concerning user comfort and motion sickness remain ongoing challenges.  Future research will likely focus on improving system efficiency, developing more intuitive user interfaces, and addressing the ethical implications of increasingly realistic and immersive experiences.  The convergence of AR and VR technologies is also expected to generate novel applications with even greater potential for transformative impact across various disciplines.
