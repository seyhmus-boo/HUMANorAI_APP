The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a paradigm shift in transportation, demanding an unprecedented level of interdisciplinary collaboration. This presentation explores the multifaceted nature of AV development, highlighting the crucial interplay between engineering, computer science, law, ethics, and sociology.  Engineering challenges encompass sensor fusion, robust control systems, and reliable infrastructure integration.  Computer science provides the foundation for artificial intelligence, machine learning algorithms, and data processing necessary for navigation and decision-making.  However, the deployment of AVs necessitates addressing complex legal and ethical dilemmas concerning liability, data privacy, and algorithmic bias.  Furthermore, societal impact studies are critical to understanding the potential effects on employment, urban planning, and social equity.  This presentation will examine these interdisciplinary links, arguing that a holistic approach, encompassing technological advancements, regulatory frameworks, and societal considerations, is essential for the safe and equitable integration of AVs into our world.  By fostering communication and collaboration across disciplines, we can navigate the complexities inherent in this transformative technology and realize its full potential.
