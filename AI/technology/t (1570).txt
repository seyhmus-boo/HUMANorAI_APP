Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct but related advancements in human-computer interaction, with roots tracing back to the mid-20th century's nascent computer graphics.  Early head-mounted displays, conceptualized as early as the 1960s, laid the groundwork for immersive VR experiences.  However, technological limitations constrained their development until significant advances in computing power and display technology in recent decades.  

AR, overlaying digital information onto the real world, emerged later but has witnessed a surge in popularity through smartphone applications and wearable devices.  VR, conversely, aims to fully immerse users in a simulated environment, achieving this through stereoscopic displays and motion tracking.  Both technologies find applications across diverse fields. VR is employed in gaming, training simulations (e.g., flight simulators, surgical training), and therapeutic interventions. AR applications range from interactive gaming and navigation systems to industrial maintenance and medical visualization, enhancing real-world tasks with supplementary information.  The ongoing convergence of AR and VR technologies promises even more powerful and integrated applications in the future, blurring the lines between the physical and digital realms.
