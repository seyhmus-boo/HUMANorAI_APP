The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is not directly attributable to quantum mechanical phenomena at the macroscopic level.  However, quantum mechanics underpins several crucial enabling technologies.  Firstly, the miniaturization of microprocessors and sensors, central to AV functionality, relies on our understanding of quantum effects in semiconductors.  Transistor behaviour, enabling high computational power in compact systems, is fundamentally quantum mechanical. Secondly, the precise positioning systems essential for AV navigation, like GPS, depend on atomic clocks whose accuracy stems from the quantized energy levels of atoms.  Quantum entanglement, while not yet directly applied, offers potential future improvements in sensor accuracy and communication speed within complex AV networks.  Finally, quantum computing, though still in its nascent stages, holds the promise of exponentially faster processing for real-time decision-making and predictive modelling crucial for navigating unpredictable scenarios.  While classical physics suffices to describe the mechanics of the vehicle itself,  the technological underpinnings of AVs are deeply rooted in the quantum realm.
