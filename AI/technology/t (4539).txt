The advent of quantum computing presents both unprecedented threats and opportunities for cybersecurity.  Existing cryptographic systems, reliant on the computational hardness of problems like integer factorization and discrete logarithm, are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers. This necessitates the development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), encompassing algorithms resistant to both classical and quantum attacks.  Current PQC research focuses on lattice-based, code-based, multivariate, and hash-based cryptography, each with its own strengths and weaknesses regarding efficiency, security, and key size.  However, the transition to PQC poses significant challenges, including the need for standardization, efficient implementation across diverse platforms, and rigorous security analysis to ensure resilience against unforeseen quantum attacks and side-channel vulnerabilities.  Furthermore, the inherent fragility of quantum key distribution (QKD) against various attacks underscores the need for robust quantum-resistant protocols and secure hardware implementation.  This abstract highlights the urgent need for interdisciplinary research bridging quantum physics, computer science, and cryptography to address the multifaceted cybersecurity challenges posed by the quantum era, ultimately securing future digital infrastructures.  The successful development and deployment of PQC and secure QKD are crucial for maintaining national security and protecting sensitive data in the quantum computing age.
