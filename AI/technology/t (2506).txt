Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are interconnected yet distinct fields within computer science. AI encompasses the broader goal of creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and learning. ML, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This learning is achieved through algorithms that identify patterns, build models, and make predictions based on input data.  Supervised learning involves training on labeled data, while unsupervised learning explores unlabeled data to discover inherent structures. Reinforcement learning, conversely, trains agents through iterative trial-and-error, optimizing behavior based on rewards and penalties.  The synergy between AI and ML is driving advancements across numerous domains, including healthcare, finance, and robotics.  However, challenges remain in addressing issues like data bias, algorithmic transparency, and the ethical implications of increasingly autonomous systems.  Future research will likely concentrate on developing more robust, explainable, and ethically sound AI/ML systems.
