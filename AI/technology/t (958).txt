Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly evolving fields demonstrating significant interdisciplinary potential.  This review highlights the crucial links between these technologies and diverse academic disciplines.  Computer science forms the foundational bedrock, providing algorithms and computational power.  However, the successful application of AI/ML extends far beyond this core.  Mathematics, particularly statistics and linear algebra, underpins model development and validation.  Furthermore, cognitive science and neuroscience offer valuable insights into human intelligence, informing the design of more effective and explainable AI systems.  Linguistics plays a critical role in natural language processing, while fields like sociology and economics contribute to understanding bias in data and the societal impact of AI deployments.  Finally, engineering disciplines are essential for implementing AI solutions in real-world applications, ranging from robotics to healthcare.  The interdisciplinary nature of AI/ML underscores the need for collaborative research, fostering innovation and mitigating potential risks through a holistic understanding of its implications across various sectors. The future of AI/ML relies heavily on these cross-disciplinary collaborations.
