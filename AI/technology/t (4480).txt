The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological leap, poised to revolutionize transportation systems globally.  While the prevailing discourse focuses on engineering, logistical, and ethical considerations, this paper explores the nascent yet crucial role of quantum mechanics in the advancement of AV technology.  Traditional approaches to sensor fusion, object recognition, and path planning rely heavily on classical computation, often facing limitations in processing speed and accuracy, particularly in complex environments.  This research investigates how quantum computing and quantum sensing technologies can overcome these limitations.  We examine the potential of quantum algorithms for accelerating computationally intensive tasks such as real-time data processing and route optimization.  Further, we explore the application of quantum sensors, offering enhanced precision and sensitivity beyond the capabilities of classical counterparts in areas like LiDAR and radar, leading to improved object detection and localization.  By investigating these quantum mechanical advancements, we aim to highlight the emerging convergence of quantum information science and the future of autonomous driving, outlining both current progress and future research directions necessary to fully realize the transformative potential of quantum-enhanced AVs.
