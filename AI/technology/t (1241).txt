This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), tracing their historical development and highlighting contemporary applications.  Early AI research, stemming from the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, initially focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems.  However, limitations in computational power and data availability hampered progress.  The subsequent rise of "expert systems" in the 1980s, while impactful in specific domains, ultimately revealed the brittleness of rule-based approaches.

The resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributed to advancements in ML, particularly deep learning.  The availability of vast datasets and increased computational power enabled the training of sophisticated algorithms capable of learning complex patterns from data, leading to breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics. This presentation will explore key ML algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, illustrating their diverse applications across various fields. We will conclude by discussing the ethical considerations and future directions of AI and ML research, emphasizing the need for responsible development and deployment of these powerful technologies.
