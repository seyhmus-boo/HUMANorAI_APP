Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, finding diverse applications across numerous sectors. This summary explores the current state and future potential of AR/VR applications. AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception and interaction, with significant applications in areas such as medical training (e.g., surgical simulations), industrial maintenance (e.g., remote expert assistance), and retail (e.g., virtual try-on). Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely computer-generated environments, providing highly realistic experiences.  Its applications span entertainment (e.g., gaming, interactive storytelling), education (e.g., immersive historical recreations), and therapy (e.g., exposure therapy for phobias).  While both technologies offer transformative potential, challenges remain.  These include issues related to hardware limitations (e.g., processing power, display resolution), software development complexities, user experience design, and ethical considerations concerning data privacy and potential for addiction.  Future research should focus on improving user interface design, addressing cost barriers, and exploring novel applications within emerging fields like artificial intelligence and the metaverse, to fully realize the transformative power of AR and VR.
