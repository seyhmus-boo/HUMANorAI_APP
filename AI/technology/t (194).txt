Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI encompasses the broader goal of creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving. ML, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This learning is achieved through algorithms that identify patterns, make predictions, and improve performance over time based on the input data.  Various ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, are employed depending on the nature of the data and the desired outcome.  While AI aims for general intelligence, ML primarily addresses specific tasks, often excelling in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics. The synergy between AI's overarching ambitions and ML's data-driven approach is driving significant advancements across numerous sectors, raising both exciting possibilities and ethical considerations regarding automation, bias, and societal impact.
