Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the applications of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).  Consider AR as a window overlaying digital information onto the real world. Think of using a smartphone app to see furniture virtually placed in your living room before purchase – that’s AR enhancing your perception of reality.  In contrast, VR creates entirely simulated environments, immersing the user completely.  Imagine stepping into a fully digital historical reenactment, experiencing sights and sounds beyond the capabilities of a documentary; this is the power of VR's immersive simulation.

The applications span diverse fields.  In medicine, AR assists surgeons with real-time anatomical overlays, while VR facilitates phobia treatment through simulated exposure.  Engineering benefits from AR for design visualization and remote collaboration, whereas VR enables realistic training simulations for complex machinery.  Entertainment also leverages both, from AR gaming that integrates the real world into gameplay to VR offering unparalleled interactive experiences.  The distinction lies in the level of immersion: AR augments the real, VR replaces it entirely, each offering unique advantages depending on the application.
