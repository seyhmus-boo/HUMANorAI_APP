Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related paradigms in human-computer interaction, originating from early head-mounted displays in the 1960s.  VR, aiming for complete immersion, replaces the real world with a simulated environment, initially driven by military and flight simulation needs.  Subsequent advancements in computing power and graphics processing units (GPUs) fueled the development of consumer-oriented VR headsets, offering interactive experiences in gaming and entertainment.

Conversely, AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing the user's perception. Early examples include rudimentary heads-up displays (HUDs) in aviation.  The proliferation of smartphones and mobile computing enabled AR's widespread adoption, exemplified by location-based games and furniture placement applications.  Both AR and VR are now finding applications across diverse fields, including healthcare (surgical simulations, rehabilitation), education (interactive learning environments), and manufacturing (design and prototyping), underscoring their potential to transform human experience and interaction.  Further research focuses on improving immersion, interaction fidelity, and addressing potential drawbacks like motion sickness and cognitive overload.
