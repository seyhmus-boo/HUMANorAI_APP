Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications represent a burgeoning field deeply intertwined with various disciplines.  Their development necessitates contributions from computer science, encompassing graphics rendering, user interface design, and 3D modelling.  Furthermore, human-computer interaction (HCI) plays a crucial role in ensuring intuitive and effective user experiences, considering factors such as ergonomics and cognitive load.  Psychology contributes to understanding user immersion, presence, and potential negative effects like cybersickness.  Engineering expertise is vital in developing the hardware, including displays, sensors, and tracking systems.  Finally, the application of AR/VR extends across diverse sectors, demanding input from fields such as medicine (surgical simulations), education (interactive learning environments), and entertainment (immersive gaming).  The interdisciplinary nature of AR/VR underscores the complexity of creating successful applications, requiring integrated expertise to address technological, psychological, and societal challenges.
