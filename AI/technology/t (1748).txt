Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation. Its conceptual foundations were laid in the mid-20th century, with seminal work like Alan Turing's "Computing Machinery and Intelligence" (1950) posing the question of machine intelligence and establishing the Turing Test as a benchmark.  Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, attempting to encode human knowledge explicitly into computer programs.  However, limitations in scalability and the handling of real-world complexities led to a period of reduced funding and progress (the "AI winter").

The resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributed to advancements in ML, a subfield focusing on enabling computer systems to learn from data without explicit programming. This paradigm shift relies on algorithms that identify patterns and build predictive models from large datasets.  Specific ML techniques, such as neural networks inspired by the structure of the human brain, have yielded significant breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and other areas.  While AI sets the overarching goal of creating intelligent systems, ML provides a powerful toolkit for achieving that goal by allowing systems to acquire and utilize knowledge from data, fueling the current wave of AI innovation.
