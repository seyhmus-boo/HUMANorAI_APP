The proliferation of big data has irrevocably reshaped the landscape of modern industries, transcending sectoral boundaries and demanding an interdisciplinary approach to its effective management and exploitation. This paper investigates the multifaceted role of big data across diverse sectors, highlighting the crucial interconnections between disciplines traditionally viewed as distinct.  While the computational aspects – data mining, machine learning, and artificial intelligence – are undeniably central, a comprehensive understanding necessitates engagement with fields like economics, sociology, and law.  Economic analysis is crucial for evaluating the cost-benefit implications of big data initiatives, while sociological perspectives illuminate the societal impacts, including issues of privacy, bias, and inequality.  Furthermore, the legal framework surrounding data ownership, security, and usage plays a critical role in shaping the ethical and practical applications of big data technologies.  This research explores these interdisciplinary links, examining how the synergy between computational sciences, social sciences, and legal frameworks shapes the successful integration and responsible deployment of big data across a spectrum of industrial applications, ranging from manufacturing and finance to healthcare and environmental science.
