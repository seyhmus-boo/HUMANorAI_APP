This review examines the burgeoning applications of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies across diverse sectors.  While distinct, AR and VR are converging, offering transformative potential.  AR applications, overlaying digital information onto the real world, are proving particularly impactful in fields such as healthcare (surgical planning, training), manufacturing (remote maintenance, design visualization), and retail (product visualization, interactive marketing).  Their success hinges on seamless integration with existing workflows and intuitive user interfaces.  VR, conversely, immerses users in fully simulated environments, showcasing significant potential in training (flight simulation, medical procedures), education (interactive learning experiences), and entertainment (gaming, virtual tourism).  However, challenges remain, including cost, accessibility, motion sickness, and the need for sophisticated content development pipelines.  This review highlights the rapid advancements and wide-ranging applicability of AR and VR, while also acknowledging the technological and ergonomic limitations that require further research and development before widespread adoption can be fully realized across all sectors.  Future research should focus on addressing user experience issues, improving hardware affordability, and exploring ethical implications of increasingly immersive technologies.
