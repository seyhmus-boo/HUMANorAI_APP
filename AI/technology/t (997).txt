Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly transforming various sectors, offering immersive experiences with significant implications.  AR, analogous to overlaying a translucent map onto a physical landscape, superimposes digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception. This is exemplified in applications like surgical navigation, where virtual anatomical models are overlaid onto the patient, improving precision.  In contrast, VR, akin to stepping into a fully simulated environment, creates entirely artificial worlds experienced through dedicated headsets. This enables applications such as flight simulation, offering a safe and cost-effective training platform for pilots, mirroring real-world scenarios without inherent risks.  While AR enhances reality by adding digital layers, VR replaces it entirely, creating entirely novel interactive experiences.  Both technologies share a foundation in computer graphics and human-computer interaction, but diverge in their approach to user engagement and application domains. Future research should focus on addressing challenges such as technological limitations, cost-effectiveness, and potential negative impacts on user well-being to fully realize the transformative potential of AR and VR.
