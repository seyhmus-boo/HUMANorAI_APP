Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges inherent in developing robust augmented and virtual reality applications.  While AR/VR technologies offer transformative potential, significant hurdles remain.  In AR, accurate and seamless overlay of digital content onto the real world presents a considerable challenge.  Occlusion handling, where virtual objects realistically interact with real-world objects, remains a significant area of research, requiring sophisticated depth sensing and scene understanding algorithms.  Furthermore, maintaining consistent tracking and registration, especially in dynamic environments, poses difficulties.  

VR, conversely, grapples with issues of presence and simulator sickness.  Achieving a convincing sense of immersion necessitates high-fidelity visuals, accurate haptic feedback, and low latency.  Developing effective countermeasures to cybersickness, a prevalent user experience involving nausea and disorientation, requires further investigation into perceptual and physiological factors.  Both AR and VR development is also constrained by computational power limitations and the need for more efficient algorithms to process complex sensory information in real-time. These are areas requiring substantial future research.
