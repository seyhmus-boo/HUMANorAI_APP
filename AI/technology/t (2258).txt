This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in developing and evaluating Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications. While AR and VR technologies offer transformative potential across diverse fields, rigorous experimentation is crucial for establishing their efficacy and usability.  We will discuss key methodological hurdles, including the difficulties in controlling for extraneous variables within immersive environments, the inherent subjectivity in user experience measurement, and the complexities of ensuring ecological validity in experimental designs.  Specific challenges related to motion sickness in VR,  the impact of varying levels of technological fidelity on participant engagement in AR, and the ethical considerations surrounding data collection in immersive contexts will be examined.  Furthermore, we will analyze the limitations of existing evaluation metrics and propose potential avenues for developing more robust and reliable methodologies. The presentation concludes by highlighting the need for a multidisciplinary approach, integrating expertise from human-computer interaction, psychology, and computer science, to address these experimental challenges and unlock the full potential of AR and VR technologies.
