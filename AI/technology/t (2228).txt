Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, while experiencing a recent surge in popularity, possess a history dating back several decades.  Early conceptualizations emerged in the mid-20th century, with Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) representing a pioneering attempt at immersive sensory simulation.  Subsequent advancements in computer graphics and display technologies fueled the development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and interactive environments.  While initial applications were largely limited by computational power and cost, significant progress in miniaturization, processing speed, and display resolution has unlocked widespread accessibility.  Contemporary AR/VR applications span diverse fields, including gaming, education, healthcare, engineering, and military training.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception and interaction, exemplified by applications like heads-up displays and interactive manuals. VR, conversely, immerses users in entirely computer-generated environments, providing opportunities for realistic simulations and interactive experiences. This abstract highlights the evolution from early conceptual prototypes to sophisticated applications, emphasizing the continuously expanding potential of AR and VR in diverse scientific and societal contexts.  Future research will likely focus on improving realism, minimizing latency, addressing user comfort, and exploring ethical implications associated with widespread adoption.
