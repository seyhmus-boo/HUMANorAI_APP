Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications represent a rapidly evolving field, deeply intertwined with diverse disciplines.  Their development necessitates expertise from computer science, encompassing areas like 3D modelling, graphics rendering, and human-computer interaction.  Psychology plays a crucial role in understanding user experience and the cognitive impact of immersive technologies, informing design choices related to usability, comfort, and potential psychological effects.  Engineering contributes through the design and development of hardware components such as headsets, sensors, and tracking systems.  Furthermore, fields like design and human factors engineering are integral for creating intuitive and user-friendly interfaces and ensuring safety and accessibility.  Finally,  the application of AR/VR extends across various sectors, requiring collaborations with medicine (surgical simulations), education (immersive learning environments), and entertainment (gaming and interactive storytelling), highlighting the inherently interdisciplinary nature of these technological advancements.  Future development will necessitate even stronger interdisciplinary collaboration to address the ethical and societal implications of these powerful tools.
