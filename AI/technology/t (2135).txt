Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the evolution of cloud computing.  Initially conceived as a means of providing on-demand access to computing resources, cloud computing has undergone a dramatic transformation.  Early models, characterized by Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), offered virtualized hardware.  This paved the way for Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), providing development and deployment environments, and subsequently, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), delivering applications directly to end-users.

Recent developments signify a shift towards even greater sophistication.  Serverless computing, eliminating the need for server management, has gained significant traction, enhancing scalability and cost-efficiency.  The rise of edge computing addresses latency concerns by processing data closer to the source, crucial for applications requiring real-time responses.  Furthermore, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning are being integrated directly into cloud platforms, offering powerful analytical capabilities and automated services.  These ongoing developments promise to further revolutionize how we access and utilize computing resources, pushing the boundaries of scalability, efficiency, and functionality.
