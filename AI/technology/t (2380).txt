Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception and decision-making.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on the input data they are trained on.

This distinction is crucial. AI represents the overarching goal, while ML provides a key methodology for achieving it.  Practical applications are abundant.  ML powers image recognition in self-driving cars, enabling object detection and navigation.  In healthcare, ML algorithms analyze medical images for disease detection, improving diagnostic accuracy.  Furthermore, recommendation systems used by online retailers leverage ML to personalize user experiences, boosting sales.  The continued advancement of both AI and ML promises transformative impacts across numerous sectors,  requiring careful consideration of ethical implications alongside technological progress.
