The field of cybersecurity faces increasingly complex challenges, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for effective solutions.  Traditional computer science expertise, while crucial for understanding vulnerabilities and developing protective technologies, is insufficient alone.  This review highlights the urgent need for integration with other disciplines.  Social sciences, particularly sociology and psychology, are critical for understanding user behavior and mitigating human error â€“ a major source of breaches.  Legal studies provide the framework for compliance, data protection regulations, and cybersecurity incident response.  Furthermore,  international relations and political science are vital in addressing state-sponsored attacks and cross-border cybercrime.  Effective solutions require collaboration across these domains.  For instance, developing robust authentication systems necessitates input from both computer scientists and psychologists to address usability and user susceptibility to social engineering. Similarly, legal frameworks are needed to ensure the ethical and legal implications of AI-driven security measures are addressed. In conclusion, a holistic, interdisciplinary perspective is not merely beneficial but essential for navigating the evolving cybersecurity landscape and developing truly effective solutions.
