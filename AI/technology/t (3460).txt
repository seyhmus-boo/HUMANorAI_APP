Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, broadly defined, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Its conceptual roots lie in the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, marking the formal inception of the field.  Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, demonstrating limited success in complex real-world applications.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data, adapting and improving their performance over time. This paradigm shift, fuelled by advancements in computing power and the availability of vast datasets, has led to the recent surge in AI's capabilities.  Key ML techniques include supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, each with unique applications and limitations.  The relationship between AI and ML is symbiotic; ML provides the crucial tools for achieving many of AI's ambitious goals, driving ongoing innovation across diverse sectors.
