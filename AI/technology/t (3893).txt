Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the creation of intelligent agents capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This learning is achieved through algorithms that identify patterns, make predictions, and improve performance over time.  Supervised learning involves training models on labeled datasets, while unsupervised learning explores unlabeled data to discover underlying structures.  Reinforcement learning, conversely, trains agents through trial-and-error interactions with an environment, optimizing for reward maximization.  The synergy between AI and ML fuels advancements across numerous domains, including computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and healthcare.  However, ethical considerations surrounding bias, transparency, and accountability remain crucial areas requiring ongoing research and development.  Future advancements will likely focus on explainable AI and robust generalization capabilities to mitigate existing limitations.
