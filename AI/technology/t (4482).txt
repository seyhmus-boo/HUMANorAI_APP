Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related technological advancements in human-computer interaction.  Their historical roots trace back to the mid-20th century, with Ivan Sutherland's "The Sword of Damocles" (1968) considered a seminal VR precursor.  Early VR systems focused on immersive, entirely computer-generated environments, primarily for simulation and training purposes.  Conversely, AR, emerging later, overlays digital information onto the real world, initially through head-mounted displays (HMDs) with limited capabilities.

The proliferation of powerful mobile computing and improved sensor technologies has significantly advanced both fields.  Currently, AR applications find widespread use in gaming, navigation (e.g., Pok√©mon Go), and industrial maintenance through real-time overlaying of instructions and schematics.  VR, meanwhile, continues to excel in gaming, architectural visualization, and medical training, offering highly immersive simulations for complex scenarios.  Further research explores the intersection of AR and VR, leading to mixed reality (MR) systems which blend real and virtual environments more seamlessly.  The continued development of haptic feedback and advanced rendering techniques promises to enhance the realism and utility of both technologies across numerous sectors.
