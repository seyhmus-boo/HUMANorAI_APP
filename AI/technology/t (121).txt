Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly expanding their applications across diverse sectors.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception and interaction, while VR immerses users in entirely computer-generated environments.  Current applications demonstrate significant potential.  In healthcare, AR is utilized for surgical planning and guidance, while VR facilitates therapeutic interventions for phobias and pain management.  Industrial applications leverage AR for maintenance and training, improving efficiency and safety through interactive, real-time overlays of technical schematics and instructions.  Similarly, VR is employed in design and architecture, enabling immersive walkthroughs and collaborative design reviews.  The entertainment industry is another key beneficiary, with AR games and filters gaining widespread popularity, and VR driving advancements in immersive gaming and cinematic experiences.  However, challenges remain, including the development of more sophisticated hardware for wider accessibility, the mitigation of potential motion sickness and cybersickness in VR applications, and the addressal of privacy concerns related to data collection and usage in AR systems. Future research should focus on improving user experience, addressing technological limitations, and investigating the ethical implications of widespread adoption.
