This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications.  While current AR/VR technologies rely on classical computational paradigms, we posit that leveraging quantum phenomena offers transformative potential.  Specifically, we examine the potential for quantum computing to accelerate rendering and processing of complex AR/VR environments, significantly improving realism and responsiveness.  Quantum algorithms, such as those based on quantum annealing, could optimize the computationally intensive tasks inherent in real-time rendering, collision detection, and physics simulations, thus enabling the creation of more immersive and interactive experiences.  Furthermore, we consider the implications of quantum cryptography for enhancing the security and privacy of AR/VR data transmission, addressing critical vulnerabilities in current systems. Finally, we discuss the theoretical possibilities of using quantum entanglement for creating novel forms of interaction within AR/VR environments, potentially leading to entirely new user interface paradigms.  The presentation concludes by outlining key challenges and research directions in realizing these quantum-enhanced AR/VR technologies, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration between quantum physicists, computer scientists, and AR/VR developers.
