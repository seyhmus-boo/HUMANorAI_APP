This presentation explores the burgeoning interdisciplinary landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  While traditionally rooted in computer science and mathematics, AI/ML's impact transcends disciplinary boundaries, fostering significant collaborations across diverse fields. We will examine key interdisciplinary links, highlighting their contributions and future potential.  Specifically, we will analyze the application of AI/ML in the biological sciences, focusing on drug discovery and personalized medicine through genomic data analysis and predictive modelling.  Furthermore, we will discuss the intersection of AI/ML with the social sciences, exploring its use in analyzing complex social phenomena, predicting societal trends, and mitigating biases within algorithms.  Finally, the ethical implications inherent in these interdisciplinary applications will be addressed, emphasizing the need for responsible innovation and collaborative efforts to ensure equitable and beneficial outcomes. This presentation advocates for strengthened interdisciplinary collaborations to harness the transformative power of AI/ML while mitigating potential risks, ultimately fostering a more inclusive and sustainable future.
