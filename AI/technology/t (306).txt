Cloud computing has rapidly evolved from a niche technology to a ubiquitous platform underpinning modern digital infrastructure. This presentation traces the key phases of this evolution, highlighting significant technological advancements and shifting paradigms.  We begin by examining the early days of grid computing and its contribution to the foundational concepts of virtualization and resource pooling, crucial precursors to the cloud model.  Subsequent sections explore the emergence of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), analyzing their distinct characteristics and impact on software development and deployment methodologies.  The presentation will then delve into the rise of serverless computing and edge computing, showcasing how these advancements are addressing the limitations of traditional cloud architectures and enabling novel applications in areas such as IoT and AI.  Finally, we discuss emerging trends such as quantum computing integration and the increasing focus on security and sustainability within the cloud ecosystem, concluding with a prospective analysis of the future trajectory of cloud computing and its broader societal implications.
