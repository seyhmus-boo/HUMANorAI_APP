Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the applications of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).  Think of VR as a complete immersion:  like stepping into a meticulously crafted film set, where you are entirely surrounded by a computer-generated environment.  This finds application in gaming, offering unparalleled immersion,  and in training simulations, allowing users to practice complex procedures, such as surgery, in a risk-free virtual space.  

In contrast, AR overlays digital information onto the real world, much like adding interactive annotations to a physical map. Imagine viewing a historical site through your phone; AR could instantly overlay historical images and facts onto your current view, enhancing the experience.  Similarly, AR assists in industrial maintenance, by superimposing schematic diagrams onto real machinery, guiding technicians in repairs.  Both AR and VR, therefore, represent significant advancements across diverse fields, offering compelling possibilities for enhancing human interaction and experience.  They are not mutually exclusive; indeed, future applications may seamlessly blend their functionalities.
