The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology signifies a potential paradigm shift in transportation. This abstract reviews the key technological developments driving the rise of AVs, focusing on sensor fusion, machine learning algorithms, and high-definition mapping.  Significant progress in computer vision, employing deep learning models for object detection and classification, coupled with advancements in lidar and radar technology, allows for robust perception in complex environments.  Simultaneously, path planning and control systems, increasingly reliant on reinforcement learning and model predictive control, are enhancing AV safety and efficiency.  However, challenges remain, including the ethical implications of decision-making algorithms in unavoidable accident scenarios, the need for robust cybersecurity measures to mitigate hacking vulnerabilities, and the development of comprehensive regulatory frameworks to ensure public safety and liability.  Further research is crucial to address these challenges and facilitate the safe and responsible integration of AVs into existing transportation infrastructure, ultimately aiming for a future with improved traffic flow, reduced accidents, and enhanced accessibility.
