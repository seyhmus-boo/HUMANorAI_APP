This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in contemporary cybersecurity research.  While theoretical models and established best practices exist, their practical application often encounters significant hurdles stemming from the inherently dynamic and unpredictable nature of cyber threats.  We focus on three key experimental challenges: (1) **Reproducibility:**  the difficulty in replicating real-world attack scenarios and subsequent defensive strategies due to the complexity of interconnected systems and the opacity of adversary tactics. (2) **Scalability:** the limitations in testing security solutions against large-scale distributed attacks, necessitating the development of novel experimental methodologies and high-fidelity simulations. (3) **Adversarial Nature:** the inherent difficulty in anticipating and modelling sophisticated adversarial behaviour, highlighting the need for adaptive and resilient experimental frameworks capable of evolving alongside emerging threats. We will discuss ongoing research aimed at addressing these challenges, including advancements in automated vulnerability discovery, large-scale simulation environments, and the development of more robust evaluation metrics for cybersecurity solutions.  The ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation, leading to more effective and resilient cybersecurity defenses.
