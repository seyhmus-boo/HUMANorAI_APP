Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly expanding, finding diverse applications across numerous sectors. AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  Practical applications range from interactive gaming and advertising to sophisticated industrial uses, such as remote expert assistance in maintenance and manufacturing, enabling real-time collaboration and problem-solving across geographical distances.  Medical professionals utilize AR for surgical planning and training, while architects and engineers employ it for immersive building visualizations.

VR, conversely, immerses users in entirely simulated environments, generating highly realistic experiences through head-mounted displays.  Its applications span entertainment, with immersive gaming and cinematic experiences leading the way, but extend significantly to training and simulation.  Flight simulators, surgical training programs, and phobia treatments benefit greatly from VR's capacity to create controlled, risk-free environments for skill development and therapeutic intervention.  Furthermore, VR facilitates virtual tourism, allowing users to explore locations remotely, and is being explored for applications in education, offering interactive and engaging learning experiences.  Both AR and VR, however, face ongoing challenges concerning cost, accessibility, and the mitigation of potential negative impacts on user health and well-being.
