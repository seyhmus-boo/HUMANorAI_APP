Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  ML algorithms identify patterns and build predictive models from input data, iteratively improving accuracy through exposure to more data.  This contrasts with traditional programming where explicit rules are defined.

Several practical applications demonstrate the power of AI and ML.  In healthcare, ML algorithms analyze medical images to aid in diagnosis, while AI-powered chatbots provide patient support.  Financial institutions leverage AI for fraud detection and algorithmic trading, optimizing risk management and profitability.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on AI and ML for object recognition and navigation, showcasing advancements in computer vision and robotics.  Furthermore, personalized recommendations in e-commerce and natural language processing in virtual assistants are powered by sophisticated ML models, demonstrating the wide-ranging impact of these technologies across numerous sectors.
