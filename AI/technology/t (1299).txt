The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) marks a significant technological leap, transitioning transportation from human-controlled systems to complex, computationally intensive algorithms. While the prevailing discourse focuses on engineering and societal implications, this paper explores the nascent field of quantum mechanics' potential contribution to the rise of AVs.  Current AV development relies heavily on classical computation, facing limitations in processing the vast amounts of real-time sensory data required for safe and efficient navigation.  This limitation is particularly acute in scenarios involving unpredictable events and complex decision-making under uncertainty.  We argue that leveraging quantum computing's inherent advantages – such as superposition and entanglement – offers a potential pathway to overcome these limitations. This research investigates the feasibility of employing quantum algorithms for crucial AV functionalities including object detection and classification, path planning in dynamic environments, and robust sensor fusion.  Specifically, we examine the potential of quantum machine learning for improving the accuracy and speed of data processing, and the application of quantum simulation for modeling complex traffic scenarios.  Ultimately, this work aims to lay the groundwork for exploring the intersection of quantum information science and autonomous vehicle technology, highlighting potential avenues for future research and development.
