Big data's transformative impact across modern industries is undeniable.  This presentation traces the evolution of big data from its nascent stages, marked by limitations in data storage and processing power, to its current ubiquitous presence.  Historically, industries relied on smaller, more manageable datasets, hindering comprehensive analysis and predictive modeling.  The advent of distributed computing frameworks like Hadoop and the proliferation of affordable, high-capacity storage redefined this landscape.

Today, industries leverage big data analytics for a diverse array of applications.  In manufacturing, predictive maintenance minimizes downtime; in finance, fraud detection and risk management are significantly enhanced; and in healthcare, personalized medicine and improved diagnostics are becoming realities.  This presentation will explore these key applications, highlighting the challenges inherent in big data management, including data security, privacy concerns, and the need for sophisticated algorithms and skilled data scientists.  Finally, it will briefly consider the future trajectory of big data, focusing on the potential of emerging technologies like AI and machine learning to further unlock its transformative potential across all sectors.
