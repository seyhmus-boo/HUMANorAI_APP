Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly intertwined yet distinct fields.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms that allow systems to learn from and make predictions on data without explicit programming.  This learning is achieved through statistical analysis, identifying patterns and relationships within datasets to improve performance over time.  Supervised learning utilizes labeled data to train models, while unsupervised learning explores unlabeled data to discover inherent structures.  Reinforcement learning, conversely, involves training agents through trial and error, rewarding desired behaviours.  The synergy between AI and ML is driving rapid advancements across numerous sectors, from healthcare and finance to transportation and manufacturing, yet ethical considerations regarding bias, transparency, and accountability remain crucial areas of ongoing research.
