Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  ML algorithms identify patterns and relationships within datasets, allowing them to improve their performance on a given task over time. This learning can be supervised, using labelled data, unsupervised, identifying inherent structures, or reinforcement-based, optimizing actions through trial and error.

The synergy between AI and ML fuels a wide array of practical applications.  In healthcare, ML algorithms analyze medical images for disease detection, improving diagnostic accuracy.  Financial institutions leverage AI for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  Autonomous vehicles rely on AI-powered perception and decision-making systems for navigation.  Furthermore, natural language processing, an AI domain enabled by ML, underpins virtual assistants and language translation tools.  The continued development of AI and ML promises to revolutionize various sectors, fostering innovation and enhancing efficiency across numerous domains.
