This review examines the burgeoning applications of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies across diverse sectors.  While distinct, AR and VR share a common thread of immersive experiences, impacting user interaction and information processing.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, finding utility in fields such as medical training (e.g., surgical simulations), engineering (e.g., remote collaboration and maintenance), and retail (e.g., virtual try-ons).  Conversely, VR creates fully simulated environments, proving valuable for entertainment, therapeutic interventions (e.g., phobia treatment, rehabilitation), and education (e.g., historical recreations, immersive learning experiences).  The review highlights significant advancements in hardware (e.g., improved displays, haptic feedback) and software (e.g., advanced rendering techniques, intuitive interfaces), driving enhanced realism and usability.  However, challenges remain, including the high cost of hardware, the potential for motion sickness and cyber sickness, and ethical concerns surrounding data privacy and the impact on social interaction.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations and exploring the synergistic potential of AR and VR in creating truly transformative experiences.
