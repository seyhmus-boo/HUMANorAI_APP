Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has rapidly evolved from its nascent stages to become a ubiquitous force shaping modern digital landscapes.  This paper explores the multifaceted history and ongoing evolution of cloud computing, tracing its development from early distributed computing concepts to its current sophisticated and multifaceted form.  The historical roots can be traced back to the development of time-sharing systems in the 1960s and the emergence of client-server architectures in the 1980s, laying the foundational groundwork for resource virtualization and remote access.  The pivotal moment arrived with the popularization of the internet in the late 1990s, enabling the scalable delivery of computing resources on demand.  This paper will analyze key milestones in this trajectory, including the rise of Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), alongside the significant technological advancements fueling this transformation, such as virtualization, containerization, and serverless computing.  Furthermore, we will examine the ongoing trends shaping the future of cloud computing, including edge computing, quantum computing integration, and the evolving security landscape.
