This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, moving beyond theoretical frameworks to highlight their practical impact across diverse sectors.  We will examine the key differentiators between AR, which overlays digital information onto the real world, and VR, which immerses users in entirely simulated environments.  The presentation will then delve into specific real-world applications, demonstrating the transformative potential of these technologies.  Examples include the use of AR in medical training for surgical simulations and enhanced patient diagnostics, and its application in industrial maintenance through interactive manuals and remote expert assistance.  We will also consider VR's role in architectural visualization, allowing clients to experience building designs before construction, and its increasing use in therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD.  Finally, the discussion will touch upon the ongoing challenges related to accessibility, affordability, and the ethical implications of immersive technologies, emphasizing the need for responsible innovation and development in this rapidly expanding field.
