Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet, has undergone a significant evolutionary trajectory.  Its conceptual roots can be traced back to the time-sharing systems of the 1960s and 1970s, which offered centralized computing resources accessed remotely.  However, the true genesis of modern cloud computing is often attributed to the emergence of the World Wide Web in the 1990s and the subsequent development of scalable internet infrastructure.  Early examples included service providers offering web hosting and email services, laying the groundwork for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The early 2000s witnessed the rise of Software as a Service (SaaS) with applications like Salesforce, demonstrating the potential for delivering entire software suites via the internet. Platform as a Service (PaaS), enabling developers to build and deploy applications without managing underlying infrastructure, emerged later, completing the foundational layers of the cloud computing stack.  This evolution has been driven by advancements in virtualization, networking technologies, and data center automation, allowing for unprecedented scalability, elasticity, and cost-effectiveness.  The ongoing development of serverless computing and edge computing represents the latest chapter in this dynamic field, further pushing the boundaries of accessibility and performance.
