This review examines the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology, analyzing its trajectory from nascent research to increasingly widespread deployment.  Significant advancements in sensor technologies (LiDAR, radar, cameras), artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning (ML) have fueled this rapid rise.  While substantial progress has been made in navigating structured environments, challenges remain, particularly concerning safety, ethical considerations in decision-making algorithms, and the robustness of systems in unpredictable conditions.  The review highlights the diverse range of stakeholders involved—automakers, technology companies, regulatory bodies, and the public—and the complex interplay of their interests in shaping AV development.  Furthermore, the socio-economic implications, including potential job displacement and transformations in urban planning, are discussed.  Despite lingering hurdles, the trajectory suggests continued growth, with ongoing research focusing on improving safety, reliability, and public acceptance to pave the way for the wider integration of AVs into society.  Future research needs to address the ethical dilemmas inherent in AV decision-making and develop robust regulatory frameworks to ensure public safety and responsible technological advancement.
