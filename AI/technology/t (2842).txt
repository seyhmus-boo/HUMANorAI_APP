Good morning. Today's lecture examines the evolution of cloud computing.  While its modern form is relatively recent, the conceptual foundations trace back to the 1960s with the development of time-sharing systems, allowing multiple users to access a central mainframe.  This early model foreshadowed the core principle of resource pooling, a cornerstone of cloud computing.

The 1990s witnessed the emergence of the internet and the crucial shift towards client-server architectures.  However, the true catalyst for cloud computing's ascendance was the development of virtualization technologies in the early 2000s.  Virtualization allowed for efficient resource allocation and dynamic scaling, paving the way for the deployment of large-scale, on-demand computing resources.

Amazon's launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006 is widely considered a pivotal moment, marking the commercialization of cloud computing as a service. This spurred rapid innovation, leading to the development of diverse cloud models including Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), fundamentally transforming how we access and utilize computing power.  The subsequent rise of major players like Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform further cemented cloud computing's position as a dominant force in the IT landscape.
