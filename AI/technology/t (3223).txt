The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) marks a significant paradigm shift in transportation, promising transformative impacts on safety, efficiency, and accessibility.  While the concept of self-driving vehicles dates back to the early 20th century, with rudimentary demonstrations appearing in the 1920s and renewed interest fueled by the development of computing technologies in the latter half of the century, true progress toward autonomous functionality has only materialized in recent decades.  Early research focused largely on automated highway systems and specialized applications, constrained by limited computational power and sensor technology. However, advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in machine learning and computer vision, coupled with the proliferation of affordable high-performance sensors like LiDAR and radar, have propelled AV technology into a period of rapid development and widespread experimentation. This paper examines the key technological advancements and socio-economic factors driving the current rise of AVs.  It will further analyze the significant challenges and ethical considerations that accompany this technological surge, exploring the complex interplay between technological feasibility, regulatory frameworks, and public acceptance as crucial determinants of its ultimate success.
