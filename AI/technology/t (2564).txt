The Internet of Things (IoT) has profoundly impacted residential environments, giving rise to the concept of the "smart home." This lecture explores the convergence of IoT devices and domestic spaces, focusing on functionalities and associated challenges.  Smart homes utilize interconnected devices, ranging from smart thermostats and lighting systems to security cameras and appliances, all communicating via networks to enhance automation, energy efficiency, and user convenience.  Data collection and analysis via these connected devices enable predictive maintenance, personalized comfort settings, and remote monitoring capabilities. However, significant concerns remain.  Issues of data privacy and security are paramount, given the volume of personal information collected and the potential for vulnerabilities within the interconnected network.  Furthermore, the scalability and interoperability of different IoT systems present technical hurdles for widespread adoption.  This presentation will conclude by outlining research directions aimed at addressing these challenges and fostering the secure and sustainable development of the smart home paradigm.
