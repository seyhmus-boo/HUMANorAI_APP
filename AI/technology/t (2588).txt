Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  Imagine AI as the overarching ambition: to create systems capable of intelligent behaviour, mimicking human capabilities like problem-solving and learning.  Machine learning, however, is a specific *tool* within the AI toolbox.

Think of it like this: AI is the aspiration to build a self-driving car; ML is the engine that enables it.  We don't explicitly program the car's navigation system with every possible road scenario. Instead, ML algorithms allow the car to "learn" from vast datasets of driving data, identifying patterns and making predictions â€“ much like a human driver gains experience.  This learning process involves statistical techniques enabling the system to improve its performance without explicit programming for each situation.  In essence, ML provides the means to achieve a subset of AI's broader goals, empowering systems to learn from data and improve autonomously.  Therefore, while all ML is AI, not all AI is ML; other approaches to AI exist.
