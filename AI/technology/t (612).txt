The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises a transformative shift in transportation, offering potential benefits ranging from increased safety and efficiency to improved accessibility for marginalized communities.  However, the realization of this vision faces significant experimental challenges that demand rigorous investigation.  This paper explores the key experimental hurdles hindering the widespread adoption of AV technology.  We focus on three primary areas:  robust perception in complex and unpredictable environments, the development of safe and reliable decision-making algorithms capable of handling edge cases and ethical dilemmas, and the creation of comprehensive testing and validation methodologies to ensure system safety and public trust.  Specifically, we examine the limitations of current sensor technologies in adverse weather conditions, the difficulties in formalizing human driving behavior for effective emulation, and the lack of standardized metrics for evaluating AV performance across diverse scenarios.  Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for accelerating the development of safe, reliable, and ethically sound autonomous driving systems, thereby paving the way for the responsible integration of AVs into society.
