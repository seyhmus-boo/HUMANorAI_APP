Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, permeating various sectors and profoundly impacting human interaction with the digital world. This paper examines the current applications of AR and VR across diverse fields, analyzing their unique capabilities and limitations.  While AR overlays digital information onto the real-world environment, enhancing user perception, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, offering unparalleled opportunities for training, education, and entertainment.  We explore a range of applications, including but not limited to, medical training simulations, interactive educational experiences, immersive gaming, architectural visualization, and remote collaboration tools.  A critical analysis of the existing literature reveals both the transformative potential of these technologies and the challenges associated with their deployment, including issues of accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and potential negative impacts on user well-being. This research contributes to a deeper understanding of the current state-of-the-art in AR and VR applications, identifying emerging trends and highlighting areas requiring further investigation to fully unlock the potential of these transformative technologies.  Specific focus will be given to the ethical considerations inherent in the development and implementation of increasingly sophisticated AR/VR systems.
