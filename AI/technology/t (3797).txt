Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct but related technological advancements impacting diverse sectors. AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones or smart glasses.  This allows for practical applications such as interactive product visualization in retail,  real-time navigation overlays in automotive systems, and immersive training simulations in medicine and aviation.  The overlay's seamless integration with the physical environment is key to its effectiveness.

Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, creating a sense of presence through head-mounted displays and haptic feedback.  This technology finds application in gaming and entertainment, but also in architecture (virtual walkthroughs of buildings), therapeutic interventions for phobias, and high-risk training scenarios where real-world practice poses significant dangers, such as surgical procedures or military training.

While AR enhances reality, VR replaces it, both offering unique advantages and complementary functionalities.  The convergence of AR and VR, termed mixed reality (MR), further expands the possibilities for creating interactive and immersive experiences across various domains.
