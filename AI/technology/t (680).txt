Cloud computing's evolution from simple remote server hosting to sophisticated, distributed systems presents significant experimental challenges.  Early research focused on resource allocation and virtualization, grappling with issues like efficient scheduling algorithms and live migration of virtual machines.  Experimentation involved constructing emulated environments and testing scalability limitations, often hampered by the inherent complexity of large-scale simulations.  

The rise of serverless computing introduced new complexities.  Function-as-a-service (FaaS) models necessitate experimentation with dynamic resource provisioning and cold-start latency optimization.  Precisely measuring the performance impact of various scaling strategies in a realistic, distributed setting demands robust experimentation methodologies and sophisticated monitoring tools.  Furthermore, exploring security and fault tolerance within highly dynamic and distributed environments poses substantial challenges, demanding rigorous testing of resilience against both expected and unexpected failures, including exploring novel attack vectors.  Addressing these challenges requires the development of advanced experimental frameworks and analytic techniques capable of managing large datasets and analyzing complex system behaviour.
