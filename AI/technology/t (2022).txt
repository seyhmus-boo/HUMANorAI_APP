Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the evolution of cloud computing.  Initially conceived as a utility computing model, cloud services have dramatically progressed beyond simple web hosting.  Early iterations, primarily characterized by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), offered virtualized hardware resources.  This foundational layer paved the way for Platform as a Service (PaaS), enabling developers with streamlined application deployment and management.  More recently, Software as a Service (SaaS) has dominated, offering readily accessible applications delivered over the internet.

Recent developments highlight several key trends.  Serverless computing, abstracting away server management entirely, offers unprecedented scalability and cost-effectiveness.  The rise of edge computing addresses latency concerns by processing data closer to its source.  Furthermore, advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly integrated into cloud platforms, providing sophisticated analytics and automation capabilities.  Finally, heightened focus on security and compliance underscores the ongoing maturation of this crucial technological domain.  These advancements signify cloud computing's continued evolution towards a ubiquitous and increasingly intelligent infrastructure.
