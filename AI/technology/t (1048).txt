The convergence of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies with the burgeoning field of quantum information science presents a compelling frontier for technological advancement.  While traditionally considered distinct domains, AR/VR applications and quantum mechanics are poised for significant synergistic development. This paper explores the nascent intersection of these fields, focusing on potential quantum-enhanced features and functionalities within AR/VR systems.  Existing AR/VR limitations, such as computational complexity in rendering realistic virtual environments and the inherent limitations of classical computing in handling vast datasets, are directly addressed by the exploration of quantum computing and quantum sensing.  We will examine the potential applications of quantum algorithms for accelerated rendering and improved scene reconstruction in real-time AR/VR experiences.  Furthermore, we analyze the prospects of utilizing quantum sensors for enhanced tracking, spatial awareness, and interaction within virtual and augmented environments.  Finally, we discuss the challenges and opportunities presented by integrating quantum technologies into AR/VR, considering both theoretical advancements and the practical limitations of current quantum hardware. This investigation highlights the transformative potential of a quantum-enhanced AR/VR landscape and proposes future research directions to facilitate its realization.
