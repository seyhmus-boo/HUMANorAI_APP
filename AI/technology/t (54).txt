The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a paradigm shift in transportation comparable to the transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles.  This presentation will explore the multifaceted factors driving this technological revolution.  We will examine the converging technological advancements –  sensor fusion acting as a sophisticated "sixth sense" for the vehicle, machine learning algorithms evolving akin to a child learning to navigate the world, and high-definition mapping providing a detailed cognitive map – which are essential for AV operation.  Just as the printing press democratized information access, AVs promise to democratize mobility, particularly benefiting the elderly and individuals with disabilities.  However, this revolution faces significant hurdles, akin to the early challenges faced by the aviation industry. These include the ethical dilemmas posed by accident scenarios, the need for robust cybersecurity to prevent malicious attacks, and the substantial infrastructure investment required for widespread adoption.  This presentation will address these challenges, comparing the current state of AV development to various historical technological transitions and offering insights into the likely future trajectories of this transformative technology.  We conclude by considering the societal implications of this shift, analogous to the societal changes wrought by the widespread adoption of the internet.
