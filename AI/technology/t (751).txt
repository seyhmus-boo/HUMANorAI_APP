This presentation explores the experimental challenges encountered in researching the impact of 5G networks on technological advancements. While 5G promises significant improvements in speed, latency, and capacity, realizing its full potential necessitates overcoming several hurdles during experimentation.  Specifically, replicating realistic 5G environments presents a major challenge.  The complexity of 5G's diverse frequency bands, MIMO configurations, and network slicing requires sophisticated and costly testbeds, limiting accessibility for many researchers.  Furthermore, accurately measuring and characterizing the impact of 5G on various applications, such as autonomous driving or augmented reality, requires specialized instrumentation and rigorous methodologies to account for the inherent variability in real-world deployments.  Data collection and analysis also present significant challenges, requiring the handling of massive datasets generated by high-throughput 5G connections.  This presentation will detail these experimental challenges, examining the limitations of existing methodologies and exploring potential solutions, including the use of emulation and simulation techniques, standardization of testing procedures, and the development of efficient data processing pipelines.  We conclude by highlighting the importance of collaborative research and resource sharing to accelerate 5G technology's impact across diverse sectors.
