Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have witnessed exponential growth, permeating diverse sectors and transforming established paradigms.  While theoretical advancements continue at a rapid pace, the practical implementation of AI/ML systems faces significant experimental challenges.  This paper focuses on these critical hurdles, examining limitations that hinder the reliable and robust deployment of AI/ML solutions.  Specifically, we explore the difficulties associated with data acquisition and preprocessing, encompassing issues such as data bias, scarcity, and the inherent heterogeneity of real-world datasets. Furthermore, we address the challenges posed by model interpretability and explainability, arguing that the "black box" nature of many advanced algorithms hinders trust and adoption.  Finally, the paper analyzes the complexities of evaluating model performance and generalizability across different contexts and datasets, highlighting the limitations of existing benchmarking methodologies. Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for advancing the field beyond proof-of-concept demonstrations and fostering the development of truly reliable and impactful AI/ML systems.
