This presentation examines the evolution of cloud computing, tracing its trajectory from early distributed computing concepts to its current ubiquitous presence.  We begin by exploring the foundational work in the 1960s and 70s, highlighting the development of time-sharing systems and the emergence of the client-server model, laying the groundwork for resource virtualization.  The presentation will then analyze the pivotal role of the internet in facilitating the transition to cloud services, focusing on the impact of key technological advancements like virtualization technologies, software-defined networking, and the rise of open-source software.

The subsequent discussion will delineate the distinct service models within the cloud computing paradigm – Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) – and their respective implications for businesses and individuals. We will further explore the ongoing evolution of the cloud landscape, including the emergence of serverless computing, edge computing, and the growing importance of security and data privacy considerations in this dynamic environment.  Finally, we will briefly speculate on future trends, such as the potential impact of quantum computing and the ongoing quest for greater efficiency and sustainability within cloud infrastructure.
