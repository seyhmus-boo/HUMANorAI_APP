This presentation explores the burgeoning intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart homes, highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary collaborations required for successful implementation and responsible development.  While technological advancements in sensor networks, embedded systems, and data analytics form the core of IoT-enabled smart homes, significant challenges lie in the social, ethical, and economic realms.  We will examine the crucial role of human-computer interaction (HCI) design in ensuring user-friendly and intuitive interfaces for managing complex smart home systems.  Furthermore, we will discuss the implications for cybersecurity, privacy, and data ownership, necessitating collaboration between computer scientists, legal scholars, and ethicists.  Finally, the presentation will address the economic dimensions, including energy efficiency improvements, cost-effectiveness analyses, and the potential for digital divides exacerbated by unequal access to smart home technologies.  By emphasizing the interconnectedness of these disciplines, we aim to stimulate discussion on the multifaceted nature of smart home development and highlight the need for integrated, interdisciplinary approaches to ensure a future where smart homes are both technologically advanced and socially responsible.
