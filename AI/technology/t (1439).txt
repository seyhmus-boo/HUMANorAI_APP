This presentation explores the transformative impact of 5G networks on various technological domains, highlighting crucial interdisciplinary linkages.  Beyond its role as a faster mobile internet, 5G's low latency and high bandwidth capabilities are revolutionizing sectors previously constrained by network limitations.  We will examine its influence on Artificial Intelligence (AI), showcasing how real-time data transmission facilitates advancements in machine learning and edge computing, particularly in applications like autonomous vehicles and smart city infrastructure. The convergence of 5G with the Internet of Things (IoT) will be analyzed, emphasizing the implications for data management, security, and the development of large-scale sensor networks in fields such as healthcare and environmental monitoring.  Further, the presentation will discuss the socio-economic implications of 5G, including the potential for increased digital inclusion and the challenges associated with data privacy and security, requiring interdisciplinary collaborations between computer scientists, engineers, social scientists, and policy makers.  Finally, we will briefly consider the future trajectory of 5G,  predicting its synergistic potential with emerging technologies like 6G and quantum computing.
