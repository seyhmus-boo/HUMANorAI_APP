This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, examining their distinct functionalities and overlapping potential.  We will utilize readily accessible analogies to clarify the often-confusing distinctions between these technologies.  Think of VR as a completely immersive, self-contained world, like stepping into a fully realized video game; it replaces your existing reality.  Conversely, AR acts as an overlay, augmenting your perception of the real world, much like a heads-up display in a fighter jet adds critical information to the pilot's view of the sky.

We will analyze applications across diverse sectors, drawing parallels to illustrate their impact.  For instance, the use of VR in surgical training mirrors the established practice of using simulators for flight training â€“ providing a risk-free environment for skill development.  Similarly, the application of AR in retail, where customers can virtually "try on" clothes using their phone camera, is akin to using a digital catalogue with interactive 3D models, vastly enhancing the shopping experience.  Finally, we will discuss the ethical implications and future directions of AR/VR, considering the potential for both transformative societal benefits and potential drawbacks, analogous to the disruptive and often unpredictable effects of previous technological leaps such as the internet.
