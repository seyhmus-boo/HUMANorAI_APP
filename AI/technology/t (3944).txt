Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent significant advancements in human-computer interaction, boasting a rich history intertwined with early computer graphics and simulation efforts.  Early conceptualizations, dating back to Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) and Ivan Sutherland's "The Ultimate Display" (1968), laid the groundwork for immersive experiences.  However, technological limitations restricted their widespread adoption until recent decades.  

AR, overlaying computer-generated information onto the real world, finds applications in diverse fields, including gaming (Pok√©mon Go), navigation (heads-up displays), and medical training (surgical simulations).  Its success hinges on advancements in sensor technology, particularly computer vision and mobile processing power.  Conversely, VR, creating entirely simulated environments, has found traction in gaming, architectural visualization, and therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD.  The development of high-fidelity head-mounted displays (HMDs) and haptic feedback systems has been crucial to enhancing user immersion and interaction.  Despite ongoing challenges, such as motion sickness and the high cost of development, both AR and VR show immense potential for transforming various sectors, driving innovation in fields from entertainment and education to healthcare and industry.
