Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related approaches to overlaying computer-generated information onto user perception.  AR, analogous to adding digital annotations to a physical map, superimposes digital content onto the real world, enhancing existing environments.  Imagine a surgeon using AR glasses to see a patient's internal anatomy overlaid onto their body during an operation â€“ the real-world patient is augmented with digital information.  In contrast, VR constructs entirely simulated environments, akin to creating a completely new map from scratch.  A user immersed in a VR headset experiences a wholly digital world, detached from physical reality.  Consider a flight simulator; the pilot trains within a completely virtual representation of atmospheric conditions and aircraft controls, far removed from the physical cockpit.  While distinct, these technologies are converging; for example, AR could provide a digital interface within a VR environment, blurring the lines between the real and the virtual.  Both AR and VR find applications across various fields, from gaming and entertainment to medicine and engineering, leveraging the power of digital overlays and simulated worlds to enhance human experiences and capabilities.
