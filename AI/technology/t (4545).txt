This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, moving beyond theoretical frameworks to examine their practical deployment across diverse sectors.  We will analyze the distinct capabilities of AR, which overlays digital information onto the real world, and VR, which immerses users in entirely simulated environments.  The presentation will showcase case studies illustrating the practical impact of these technologies.  Examples will include the use of AR in surgical planning and training, enhancing the precision and reducing risk of complex procedures.  Furthermore, we will discuss the application of VR in therapeutic settings, such as exposure therapy for phobias and rehabilitation programs for physical injuries.  Industrial applications will also be highlighted, focusing on VR's role in remote collaboration, equipment training, and design visualization. Finally, we will briefly address the challenges and ethical considerations surrounding the widespread adoption of AR and VR, including accessibility, data privacy, and the potential for technological bias.  This presentation aims to provide a balanced overview of the transformative potential and the inherent complexities of these rapidly evolving technologies.
