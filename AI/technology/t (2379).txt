Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet interconnected technological advancements with a shared history rooted in early computer graphics research.  The conceptual foundations of both were laid in the mid-20th century, with Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) considered a pioneering VR device offering multi-sensory immersion.  Subsequent developments, including Ivan Sutherland's "Sword of Damocles" (1968), established the rudimentary principles of head-mounted displays and interactive 3D environments.  However, technological limitations significantly restricted early applications. The advent of more powerful processing capabilities and miniaturized sensors in recent decades has facilitated a surge in AR and VR applications across diverse sectors.  AR, overlaying digital information onto the real world, finds utility in fields ranging from gaming and retail (e.g., virtual try-ons) to healthcare (surgical guidance) and manufacturing (maintenance instructions).  Conversely, VR, creating entirely immersive simulated environments, is utilized extensively in training simulations (e.g., flight simulators, medical procedures), entertainment (gaming, virtual tourism), and therapeutic interventions for phobia treatment.  The ongoing evolution of these technologies promises even greater integration and impact across numerous aspects of human life.
