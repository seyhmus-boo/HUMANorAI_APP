This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in modern cybersecurity research, moving beyond theoretical frameworks to address practical limitations.  We argue that the inherent dynamism of cyber threats necessitates a shift towards experimental methodologies that capture the complexity and unpredictability of real-world attacks.  Specifically, we examine the difficulties in creating realistic and repeatable experimental environments that accurately reflect the heterogeneous nature of networked systems and the adaptive behaviour of sophisticated adversaries.  Challenges include the ethical considerations surrounding the use of live systems, the difficulty in replicating the scale and complexity of real-world networks in controlled settings, and the limitations of current evaluation metrics in capturing the nuanced effectiveness of security solutions. We propose a framework for developing more robust experimental designs that incorporate diverse attack vectors, automated adversary emulation, and rigorous statistical analysis. This framework emphasizes the need for standardized methodologies and shared resources to enhance reproducibility and cross-validation across different research efforts. Finally, we outline future research directions that focus on developing more representative experimental environments to rigorously evaluate emerging cybersecurity technologies.
