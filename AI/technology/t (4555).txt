Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have witnessed unprecedented growth, permeating diverse sectors and transforming societal landscapes.  However, the practical application of these powerful technologies remains hampered by significant experimental challenges. This paper investigates these critical hurdles, focusing on the limitations encountered during the development, deployment, and evaluation of AI/ML systems.  We address the inherent difficulties associated with data acquisition, encompassing issues such as data bias, scarcity, and the "curse of dimensionality."  Furthermore, the complexities of model selection, training, and optimization, particularly in relation to computationally intensive deep learning models, are explored.  The ethical implications arising from algorithmic bias and opacity, alongside the difficulty of establishing robust generalizability and explainability in AI/ML models, are also central to our discussion.  Finally, we examine the challenges in evaluating the performance and reliability of these systems, including the lack of standardized benchmarks and the difficulty in assessing their real-world impact. This analysis aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the experimental barriers hindering the full potential of AI and ML, ultimately paving the way for more robust and responsible technological development.
