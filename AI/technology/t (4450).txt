Good morning. Today's lecture examines the evolution of cloud computing and its significant interdisciplinary connections.  Initially conceived as a utility computing model in the late 1990s, cloud computing leveraged existing distributed systems research from computer science.  However, its rapid proliferation stemmed from advancements in networking technologies (telecommunications engineering) and the increasing availability of high-speed internet access.

The evolution hasn't been solely technological.  The rise of cloud computing necessitates interdisciplinary collaboration across economics (pricing models, resource allocation), law (data privacy, security regulations), and management (organisational change, risk assessment).  Furthermore, societal impacts, studied by social scientists, encompass issues like digital equity and the ethical implications of data ownership within cloud infrastructures.  Therefore, understanding cloud computing's development requires appreciation for its multifaceted nature, encompassing technical, economic, legal, and societal dimensions.  This interdisciplinary lens is crucial for navigating the complexities and challenges presented by this transformative technology.
