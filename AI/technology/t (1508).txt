This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), highlighting its increasingly crucial interdisciplinary nature.  While rooted in computer science and mathematics, the transformative power of AI/ML necessitates collaboration across diverse disciplines. We will examine key interdisciplinary linkages, focusing on applications in the humanities, social sciences, and physical sciences.  Examples will include the use of natural language processing in literary analysis, ML algorithms for predicting social unrest based on socio-economic data, and AI-driven advancements in materials science and drug discovery.  Further, we will discuss the ethical considerations inherent in these interdisciplinary collaborations, emphasizing the need for responsible development and deployment of AI/ML technologies. The presentation concludes by considering the future trajectory of AI/ML research, emphasizing the synergistic potential of interdisciplinary approaches to address complex global challenges and unlock innovative solutions across various fields.  This necessitates a concerted effort towards fostering collaborative research environments and cultivating interdisciplinary expertise.
