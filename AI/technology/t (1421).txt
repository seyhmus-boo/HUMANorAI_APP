This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in leveraging big data within modern industries.  While the potential benefits of big data analytics are widely acknowledged, realizing this potential is hampered by significant methodological and practical obstacles. We will examine three key challenges: firstly, the inherent biases present within large datasets, and the difficulty in mitigating these biases to ensure robust and generalizable results. Secondly, the computational complexity of processing and analyzing massive datasets, requiring the development of novel and efficient algorithms, as well as access to high-performance computing infrastructure. Finally, the ethical implications of utilizing sensitive personal data will be addressed, highlighting the need for robust data governance frameworks and responsible data handling practices.  We will discuss ongoing research aiming to overcome these obstacles, focusing on advancements in bias detection and mitigation techniques, distributed computing frameworks, and privacy-preserving data analysis methods.  The presentation concludes by outlining future research directions necessary for unlocking the full potential of big data in diverse industrial settings.
