The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological shift with far-reaching societal implications.  This review examines the key factors driving AV development, including advancements in artificial intelligence, sensor technologies (LiDAR, radar, cameras), and high-definition mapping.  While significant progress has been made in controlled environments, challenges remain in navigating complex and unpredictable real-world scenarios, particularly concerning edge cases and robust perception in adverse weather conditions. Ethical considerations surrounding accident liability, data privacy, and job displacement are also central to the ongoing debate.  Furthermore, the review highlights the crucial role of infrastructure development, including dedicated AV lanes and communication networks (V2X), in facilitating widespread AV adoption.  Despite these hurdles, the potential benefits – increased road safety, improved traffic flow, and enhanced accessibility for individuals with limited mobility – are substantial.  Future research should prioritize addressing the remaining technological and societal challenges to ensure a safe and equitable transition towards a future integrated with AVs.
