While seemingly unrelated, the rise of autonomous vehicles is profoundly impacted by quantum mechanics, albeit indirectly.  The computational power underpinning self-driving capabilities relies heavily on sophisticated algorithms running on increasingly miniaturized transistors.  These transistors, at their core, operate according to quantum mechanical principles.  The ability to shrink transistors to nanoscale dimensions, enabling the processing power required for real-time object detection, path planning, and decision-making, is a direct consequence of our understanding of quantum tunneling and electron confinement.  Furthermore, the development of advanced sensors, such as LiDAR, which use laser technology based on stimulated emission, a purely quantum phenomenon, is crucial.  Improvements in materials science, enabling the creation of higher-efficiency batteries, are also driven by quantum mechanical modelling and simulation. Thus, although autonomous vehicles don't directly utilize quantum computation, their very existence hinges on the technological advancements facilitated by a deep understanding of quantum mechanics at the fundamental level.
