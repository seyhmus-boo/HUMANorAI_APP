Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has rapidly evolved from its nascent stages to become a ubiquitous force shaping various sectors globally.  This paper explores the multifaceted evolution of cloud computing, emphasizing its increasingly interdisciplinary nature.  While initially rooted in computer science and networking, the growth of cloud technology has fostered significant interconnections with fields such as economics, law, and sociology.  The economic implications, encompassing business models, market structures, and cost optimization strategies, are intrinsically linked to its technical advancements.  Legal frameworks surrounding data privacy, security, and jurisdiction are crucial in navigating the complexities of distributed data storage and processing.  Furthermore, sociological impacts, including digital divides, workforce transformations, and societal dependence on cloud infrastructure, warrant critical examination.  This research undertakes a chronological analysis of cloud computing's technological progression, simultaneously investigating its intertwined relationships with these diverse disciplines. By examining these interdisciplinary linkages, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of cloud computingâ€™s evolution and its far-reaching consequences.
