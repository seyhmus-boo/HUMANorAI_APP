Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are inextricably linked fields within computer science, focusing on the development of systems capable of intelligent behavior.  Early AI, dating back to the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, aimed at creating general-purpose intelligent agents through symbolic reasoning and expert systems. However, limitations in computational power and data availability hampered progress. The subsequent AI winter saw reduced funding and enthusiasm.

The resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributable to advancements in ML, specifically deep learning.  ML algorithms, unlike traditional rule-based AI, learn patterns from data, iteratively improving their performance through training.  This paradigm shift enabled breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing, exemplified by AlphaGoâ€™s victory over a Go champion. Deep learning, employing artificial neural networks with multiple layers, allows for the extraction of complex features from raw data, achieving previously unattainable levels of accuracy.  While the field continues to evolve, ethical considerations surrounding bias in algorithms, data privacy, and the societal impact of automation remain crucial areas of ongoing research and debate.
