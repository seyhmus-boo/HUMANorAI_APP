Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming numerous sectors, prompting extensive research into their capabilities and limitations.  This paper explores the synergistic relationship between AI and ML, focusing on the latter's role as a crucial enabling technology for achieving advanced AI functionalities.  We examine the foundational algorithms underpinning various ML approaches, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, highlighting their distinct strengths and weaknesses in tackling complex real-world problems.  The paper further investigates the ethical and societal implications arising from the increasing deployment of AI/ML systems, such as bias in algorithms, data privacy concerns, and the potential for job displacement.  A critical analysis of current research trends is presented, encompassing advancements in deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision, along with an evaluation of their impact across diverse domains.  Finally, we discuss future research directions, emphasizing the need for robust methodologies to address the inherent challenges in ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability within AI/ML systems.
