Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of shared computing resources over a network, has undergone a dramatic evolution since its conceptual roots in the 1960s with the introduction of time-sharing systems and the ARPANET.  Early iterations, characterized by proprietary solutions and limited scalability, paved the way for the emergence of service-oriented architectures in the late 1990s.  The pivotal role of the internet's expansion and advancements in virtualization technology facilitated the development of the three primary cloud service models: Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).  Amazon's launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006 is widely considered a watershed moment, marking the commercialization and popularization of cloud computing.  Subsequent years have witnessed the rapid growth of hyperscale cloud providers and a diversification of services, including serverless computing, edge computing, and the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence and machine learning within cloud environments.  Ongoing research focuses on enhancing security, scalability, and the development of more sustainable and efficient cloud architectures to address the challenges posed by increasing data volumes and energy consumption.
