Artificial intelligence (AI) represents the broader aspiration to create machines capable of mimicking human intelligence, encompassing a range of approaches.  Imagine it as the overarching goal of building a self-driving car:  the ability to navigate, react to obstacles, and reach a destination autonomously.  Machine learning (ML), conversely, is a specific subset of AI, akin to a particular engineering solution within that self-driving car project.  ML focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of explicitly instructing the car to turn at every intersection, ML algorithms allow the car to learn optimal turning behaviours by analyzing vast datasets of driving scenarios.  This learning process often involves statistical models, like identifying patterns in traffic data to predict optimal routes, analogous to a student learning from examples rather than rote memorization.  Deep learning, a further specialization within ML, uses complex layered networks inspired by the human brain, enabling even more sophisticated pattern recognition, representing an advanced, specialized subsystem within our self-driving car analogy, perhaps a highly refined vision system.  Thus, ML provides crucial tools to achieve the wider aims of AI.
