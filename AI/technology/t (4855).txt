This presentation examines the evolving landscape of cybersecurity challenges and explores emerging solutions designed to mitigate escalating threats.  Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly impacted both the offensive and defensive sides of cybersecurity.  While AI-powered attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect, leveraging AI in cybersecurity defense offers promising advancements.  We will discuss the application of machine learning for anomaly detection, threat prediction, and incident response, highlighting the benefits and limitations of these approaches.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the persistent challenges of human error and social engineering, emphasizing the crucial role of robust security awareness training and multi-factor authentication.  Finally, the implications of the expanding Internet of Things (IoT) and the resulting increase in attack surfaces will be explored, alongside the need for enhanced device security and network segmentation strategies.  The overall aim is to provide an overview of the current cybersecurity threat matrix and showcase cutting-edge solutions that are essential for building resilient and secure digital infrastructures.
