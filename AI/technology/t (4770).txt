This presentation explores the experimental challenges encountered in researching the impact of 5G networks on diverse technological sectors. While 5G promises transformative advancements across numerous fields, realizing its full potential requires overcoming significant hurdles in empirical investigation.  We will focus on three key areas: (1)  Replicating realistic 5G environments for experimentation.  Achieving consistent, high-fidelity simulations of 5G network characteristics, including mobility, interference, and varying channel conditions, presents a considerable challenge, often requiring costly and complex infrastructure. (2)  Measuring and analyzing the performance of applications within dynamic 5G environments.  The inherent variability of 5G necessitates robust methodologies for quantifying the impact on application latency, throughput, and reliability, particularly within complex multi-device scenarios.  (3)  Developing effective methodologies for evaluating the security and privacy implications of 5G.  The increased connectivity and data volume necessitates novel experimental approaches to assess vulnerability to attacks and the efficacy of security protocols in real-world scenarios.  This presentation will discuss these challenges in detail, presenting potential solutions and highlighting areas for future research, ultimately aiming to pave the way for more rigorous and impactful studies on the technological implications of 5G.
