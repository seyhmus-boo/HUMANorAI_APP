Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are distinct yet intertwined fields within computer science. AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.  ML, a subfield of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computer systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This learning is achieved through the identification of patterns and relationships within datasets, enabling the system to make predictions or decisions on new, unseen data.  Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning represent major approaches within ML, each characterized by different data structures and learning paradigms.  While AI aims for broad intelligent behavior, ML provides a crucial mechanism for achieving this goal by enabling systems to adapt and improve their performance over time through exposure to data.  The increasing availability of large datasets and advancements in computational power have fueled rapid progress in both fields, leading to significant advancements across various domains, from image recognition to natural language processing.
