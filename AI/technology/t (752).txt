5G networks represent a significant technological advancement, profoundly impacting various sectors. This review examines the key technological innovations enabling 5G's superior performance, including increased bandwidth through wider frequency bands and the implementation of massive MIMO technology.  These improvements facilitate significantly higher data rates and reduced latency, impacting applications across multiple domains.  The impact on Internet of Things (IoT) proliferation is considerable, enabling seamless connectivity for a vast network of smart devices.  Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) experiences improved speeds and capacity, supporting high-definition video streaming and augmented reality applications.  Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) is revolutionising sectors requiring immediate responsiveness, such as autonomous vehicles and industrial automation.  However, challenges remain, including the cost of infrastructure deployment, spectrum allocation complexities, and potential health concerns associated with increased radiofrequency exposure.  Further research is required to fully understand the long-term societal and environmental implications of widespread 5G adoption, focusing on equitable access and responsible technological advancement.  Overall, 5G networks are driving technological innovation and transforming the digital landscape, but careful consideration of associated challenges is crucial for optimal societal benefit.
