Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture will explore blockchain technology and its diverse applications beyond cryptocurrency. At its core, blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger â€“ a continuously growing list of records secured using cryptography.  This decentralized nature renders it resistant to single points of failure and manipulation.  Each "block" contains a batch of transactions, linked cryptographically to the previous block, forming an unbroken chain.

This fundamental structure facilitates a range of practical applications.  Supply chain management benefits significantly through enhanced traceability and transparency, allowing businesses to track goods from origin to consumer, combating counterfeiting and improving efficiency.  Furthermore, blockchain's security features are leveraged in digital identity management systems, providing secure and verifiable credentials.  Healthcare also sees potential, with secure storage and sharing of patient medical records.  Finally,  decentralized finance (DeFi) applications utilize blockchain to build new financial systems independent of traditional intermediaries, offering innovative lending and investment opportunities.  These are but a few examples illustrating the transformative potential of blockchain technology across various sectors.
