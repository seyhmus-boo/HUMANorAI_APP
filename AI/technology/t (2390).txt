Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science. AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation.  Its conceptual roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, widely considered the birthplace of AI as a field of study.  Early efforts focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, aiming to program explicit knowledge into machines. However, limitations in handling complex, real-world data became apparent.  This paved the way for the rise of ML, a subfield of AI that emphasizes learning from data rather than explicit programming. ML algorithms identify patterns and build models from data inputs, enabling systems to improve their performance on specific tasks without explicit instructions.  The development of powerful algorithms like support vector machines and the subsequent surge in data availability and computational power, particularly from the 2010s onward, has driven significant advancements in ML, leading to breakthroughs in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics, fundamentally altering various sectors of society.  The ongoing interplay between AI’s overarching goals and ML’s data-driven approach continues to shape the trajectory of this rapidly evolving field.
