Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrency applications, has rapidly expanded its potential across diverse sectors. This presentation provides an overview of blockchain's core functionalities, emphasizing its decentralized, transparent, and immutable nature. We examine its underlying cryptographic principles and consensus mechanisms, highlighting the trade-offs between security, scalability, and efficiency in various implementations, including Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake.  The presentation then explores a range of real-world applications, focusing on its potential to revolutionize supply chain management through enhanced traceability and transparency, improve the security and efficiency of digital identity systems, and facilitate the development of decentralized finance (DeFi) platforms.  Specific case studies will illustrate how blockchain is being deployed to address challenges in data integrity, trust, and interoperability across different industries. Finally, we discuss the ongoing challenges and limitations of blockchain technology, including regulatory uncertainty, energy consumption concerns, and the need for interoperability standards, concluding with a prospective view of future research directions.
