Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the evolution of cloud computing.  Its conceptual roots lie in the time-sharing systems of the 1960s, which allowed multiple users to access a central mainframe.  However, the modern iteration emerged significantly later, fuelled by advancements in networking and virtualization technologies. The 1990s saw the rise of the internet, laying the foundation for remote resource access.  Early cloud services, primarily focused on infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), began appearing in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with companies like Amazon pioneering the shift with Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006. This marked a paradigm shift from owning physical infrastructure to consuming computing resources on demand.  Subsequently, platform-as-a-service (PaaS) and software-as-a-service (SaaS) models matured, offering increasingly comprehensive solutions.  This evolution continues, driven by factors such as increased bandwidth, serverless computing, and the burgeoning field of edge computing, promising further decentralization and improved responsiveness.  The cloud's impact across diverse sectors is undeniable, transforming how we access and utilize computing power.
