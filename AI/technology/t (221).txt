Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely intertwined yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation.  Its conceptual roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, which is widely considered the birthplace of the field. Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, aiming to explicitly program intelligence.  However, limitations in representing complex real-world knowledge led to a period of reduced funding and progress (the "AI winter").  In contrast, machine learning, a subfield of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns and relationships from data, adapting and improving their performance over time.  The proliferation of computing power and the availability of massive datasets in recent decades have fueled a resurgence in both AI and ML, leading to significant breakthroughs in areas like deep learning, natural language processing, and computer vision. This renewed focus on data-driven approaches has propelled AI from largely theoretical explorations to impactful applications across diverse sectors, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.
