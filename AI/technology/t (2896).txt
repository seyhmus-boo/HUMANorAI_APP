The future of quantum computing hinges on overcoming significant challenges rooted in fundamental quantum mechanical principles.  While theoretical frameworks, such as fault-tolerant quantum computation based on quantum error correction codes, offer pathways to scalable and reliable quantum computers, their practical implementation remains a formidable hurdle.  Maintaining quantum coherence, the delicate preservation of superposition and entanglement, is crucial yet exceptionally difficult. Environmental decoherence, caused by interactions with the surrounding environment, leads to rapid loss of quantum information.  Advances in materials science, exploring novel qubit architectures and fabrication techniques like topological quantum computing, are therefore vital to extend coherence times.  Furthermore, scaling up the number of qubits while maintaining controllability and connectivity presents a major engineering challenge.  Developing efficient quantum algorithms that leverage the unique capabilities of quantum mechanics, beyond simply accelerating classical algorithms, is equally critical.  Progress in these areas, which are deeply intertwined with our understanding of fundamental quantum phenomena such as quantum many-body physics and quantum field theory, will determine the ultimate capabilities and impact of quantum computing on scientific and technological domains.
