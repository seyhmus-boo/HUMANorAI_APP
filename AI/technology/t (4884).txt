This presentation explores the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs) through a novel lens: quantum mechanics. While seemingly disparate, quantum phenomena underpin crucial AV technologies.  Specifically, we examine the role of quantum mechanics in several key components.  Firstly, advanced sensor technologies, including LiDAR and radar, rely on precise measurements of photons and electromagnetic waves, which are fundamentally governed by quantum principles.  The sensitivity and resolution of these sensors, crucial for accurate environmental mapping, are directly influenced by quantum noise and limitations.  Secondly, the computational power required for real-time decision-making within AVs necessitates highly efficient algorithms. Quantum computing, although still in its nascent stages, promises significant speedups for complex tasks such as path planning and object recognition, overcoming classical computational bottlenecks.  Finally, the security and trustworthiness of AV systems are paramount.  Quantum cryptography offers the potential for unbreakable communication channels, protecting crucial data transmitted between the vehicle, its infrastructure, and cloud services.  This presentation will briefly review the relevant quantum mechanical principles and discuss their current and future impact on the development and implementation of safe, reliable, and secure autonomous vehicles.
