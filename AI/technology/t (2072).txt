The future of quantum computing hinges not only on technological advancements but also on robust interdisciplinary collaborations.  This presentation explores the crucial interplay between physics, computer science, and mathematics in shaping the field's trajectory. We will examine current limitations, including the challenges of error correction, qubit scalability, and algorithm development, highlighting how breakthroughs in materials science, condensed matter physics, and quantum information theory are vital for addressing these obstacles.  Furthermore, the development of quantum-resistant cryptography necessitates strong collaboration between computer scientists, mathematicians, and cryptographers to ensure secure communication in a post-quantum world.  Beyond hardware and security,  we will discuss the burgeoning impact of quantum computing on diverse fields such as medicine (drug discovery, personalized therapies), finance (risk management, portfolio optimization), and materials science (designing novel materials).  Finally, the ethical and societal implications, including potential biases in algorithms and access disparities, demand an interdisciplinary approach involving social scientists, ethicists, and policymakers to ensure responsible innovation and equitable deployment of this transformative technology.  This presentation will argue that the future of quantum computing is fundamentally intertwined with the strength of its interdisciplinary partnerships.
