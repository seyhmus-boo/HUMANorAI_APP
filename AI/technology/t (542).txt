This presentation explores the evolution of cloud computing, highlighting key experimental challenges that have shaped its trajectory and continue to hinder its full potential.  We trace the progression from early grid computing models to the current dominance of hyperscale cloud providers, emphasizing the pivotal role of virtualization and containerization technologies in enabling scalability and resource elasticity.  However, this evolution has been accompanied by a series of persistent experimental obstacles.  Reproducibility remains a major hurdle, with variations in hardware, software configurations, and network conditions hindering consistent experimental results across different cloud environments.  Moreover, the inherent complexity of distributed systems, compounded by the black-box nature of many cloud services, complicates the precise measurement and analysis of performance, energy consumption, and fault tolerance.  We will further discuss challenges related to security experimentation, particularly in addressing emerging threats within dynamic and heterogeneous cloud environments.  Finally, the presentation will briefly consider emerging research directions aimed at mitigating these challenges and fostering a more rigorous and repeatable experimental methodology within cloud computing research.
