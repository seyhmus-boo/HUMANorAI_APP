Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet, has undergone a significant evolution since its conceptual origins.  While the fundamental concept of shared computing resources predates the internet itself,  the modern iteration traces its roots back to the 1960s with the development of time-sharing systems.  These early models, while offering a rudimentary form of resource pooling, lacked the scalability and accessibility of contemporary cloud systems.  The development of the internet and the subsequent rise of virtualization technologies in the late 1990s and early 2000s proved crucial.  Virtualization allowed for the efficient allocation and management of physical hardware, paving the way for large-scale, distributed computing environments.  The emergence of prominent providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) with its Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) in 2006 marked a pivotal moment, ushering in the era of cloud computing as we know it. This period witnessed a rapid expansion of services, encompassing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), catering to a diverse range of user needs and fostering continuous innovation in areas such as serverless computing and edge computing.
