This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and artificial intelligence (AI), specifically focusing on the potential of quantum machine learning (QML). While classical AI relies on probabilistic algorithms, QML leverages the principles of quantum mechanics, offering the prospect of surpassing classical computational limits for specific classes of problems. We will discuss the fundamental differences between classical and quantum computation, highlighting how superposition and entanglement enable QML algorithms to achieve exponential speedups in certain scenarios.  Specific examples will include the application of quantum annealing for optimization problems, and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) approaches to machine learning tasks such as classification and regression.  The challenges inherent to QML, such as noise and the limited availability of fault-tolerant quantum computers, will be addressed.  Finally, we will explore the potential future impact of QML, examining its anticipated advancements in fields like drug discovery, materials science, and financial modeling, thereby underscoring the transformative potential of harnessing quantum phenomena for next-generation AI.  The presentation concludes by outlining crucial open research questions and promising avenues for future development within this rapidly evolving field.
