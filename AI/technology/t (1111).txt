Good morning. Today's lecture will explore the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and their diverse applications.  Recent advancements have significantly broadened their impact across numerous sectors.  In VR, advancements in haptic feedback technology are enhancing immersion and user interaction, fostering more realistic simulations for training purposes, from surgical procedures to pilot training.  High-fidelity visuals and improved tracking systems are also contributing to the growth of VR gaming and entertainment.

Meanwhile, AR applications are seeing a surge in practicality.  Developments in computer vision and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) algorithms permit more accurate and robust overlaying of digital information onto the real world.  This facilitates applications in areas like retail, with virtual try-on features, and industrial maintenance, using AR overlays to guide technicians through complex repair processes.  Furthermore, the integration of AR with mobile devices ensures wider accessibility, propelling its adoption across various demographics.  The convergence of these technologies promises even more sophisticated and impactful applications in the future.
