The field of cybersecurity grapples with increasingly sophisticated threats, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to effective mitigation.  Recent scholarship highlights the limitations of solely technical solutions, emphasizing the crucial role of human factors, legal frameworks, and economic considerations.  Challenges such as evolving malware, supply chain vulnerabilities, and the rise of AI-powered attacks necessitate a collaborative effort.

Effective solutions require a fusion of computer science expertise in cryptography and network security with sociological insights into user behavior and organizational culture.  Legal and policy frameworks, addressing issues like data privacy and incident response, are vital in creating a robust regulatory environment.  Furthermore, economic incentives and disincentives play a critical role in shaping individual and organizational cybersecurity posture.  Interdisciplinary research, bridging the gap between technical, social, and legal domains, is essential to developing comprehensive strategies for preventing and responding to cyberattacks.  Future research should focus on strengthening these interdisciplinary links to develop more resilient and adaptable cybersecurity ecosystems.
