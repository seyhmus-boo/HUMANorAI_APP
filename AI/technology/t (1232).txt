The future of quantum computing hinges significantly on overcoming substantial experimental challenges.  Maintaining quantum coherence, the crucial property allowing for superposition and entanglement, remains a primary hurdle.  Environmental noise, stemming from sources such as thermal fluctuations and electromagnetic interference, rapidly decoheres qubits, limiting computation time and fidelity.  Scaling up the number of qubits while preserving coherence poses a considerable technological barrier;  current architectures face difficulties in controlling and interconnecting large qubit arrays with sufficient precision.  Furthermore, developing robust and efficient quantum error correction codes is paramount.  While theoretical frameworks exist, practical implementations struggle with the overhead required for error detection and correction, often negating the benefits of increased qubit count.  Finally, the fabrication of qubits themselves presents significant material science challenges.  Different qubit modalities (e.g., superconducting, trapped ions, photonic) present unique fabrication and control complexities, demanding highly specialized techniques and materials with exceptional purity and stability.  Addressing these experimental limitations is critical for realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of tackling computationally intractable problems.
