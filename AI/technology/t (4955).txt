Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrency applications, has evolved into a versatile distributed ledger technology (DLT) with far-reaching implications across diverse sectors.  Its core functionality, ensuring data integrity and transparency through cryptographic hashing and consensus mechanisms, underpins a range of innovative applications.  This paper summarizes key blockchain features, including immutability, decentralization, and security, examining their impact on various sectors.  Notable applications include supply chain management, enhancing traceability and reducing counterfeiting; healthcare, improving data privacy and interoperability; finance, facilitating secure and efficient transactions beyond cryptocurrency; and digital identity management, offering robust and verifiable identity solutions.  However, scalability limitations, regulatory uncertainties, and the energy consumption associated with certain consensus mechanisms remain significant challenges.  Future research should focus on optimizing blockchain performance, developing robust regulatory frameworks, and exploring environmentally friendly consensus protocols to fully unlock its transformative potential across various industries.
