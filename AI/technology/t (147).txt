Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, represents the on-demand availability of computing resources—servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the internet.  Its evolution can be broadly categorized into three stages:  the early adoption of web-based services (e.g., email), the emergence of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) providing virtualized hardware, and the current era dominated by Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS), offering complete application environments and ready-to-use software respectively.

This evolution has been driven by advancements in virtualization, network technologies, and data center automation.  Practical applications are ubiquitous, encompassing diverse fields.  IaaS facilitates scalable web infrastructure for businesses like Netflix, while PaaS empowers developers to rapidly deploy applications without managing underlying infrastructure. SaaS provides readily available solutions for CRM (e.g., Salesforce), project management (e.g., Asana), and office productivity (e.g., Google Workspace), significantly reducing operational overhead for organizations of all sizes.  The continued evolution is likely to focus on enhanced security, artificial intelligence integration, and edge computing, further broadening its applicability and impact.
