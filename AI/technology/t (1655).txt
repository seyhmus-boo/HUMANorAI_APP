Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on the applications of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).  Think of VR as a complete immersion, like stepping into a meticulously crafted movie set.  You are entirely enveloped in a digitally generated environment, interacting solely within that space,  making it ideal for simulations – from flight training, where pilots practice maneuvers without risk, to surgical planning, allowing surgeons to rehearse complex procedures.

Conversely, AR acts as an overlay, much like adding digital annotations to the real world. Imagine viewing a historical battlefield, and through your device, seeing soldiers superimposed on the landscape or witnessing past events unfold – this is AR in action. Its applications range from interactive gaming and retail experiences, where virtual furniture can be placed in your living room, to industrial maintenance, using AR overlays to guide technicians through complex repairs.  The key distinction lies in the level of immersion; VR replaces reality, while AR enhances it. Both technologies are rapidly evolving, offering transformative potential across various sectors.
