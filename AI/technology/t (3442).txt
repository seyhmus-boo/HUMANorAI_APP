This presentation traces the evolution of cloud computing from its nascent stages as utility computing to its current ubiquitous presence across diverse sectors.  We will explore the key technological advancements that have driven this transformation, including virtualization, containerization, and serverless architectures.  The shift from Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), through Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) will be examined, highlighting the impact on both development methodologies and business models.

The presentation will further demonstrate the profound practical applications of cloud computing across various fields. Examples will include its role in enabling scalable e-commerce platforms, facilitating the growth of big data analytics and machine learning initiatives, powering sophisticated healthcare applications such as remote patient monitoring and genomic analysis, and driving innovation in areas like autonomous vehicles and smart cities.  Furthermore, we will briefly discuss emerging trends such as edge computing and quantum computing and their potential to shape the future trajectory of cloud technologies. The conclusion will consider the ongoing challenges related to security, data privacy, and sustainability within the increasingly complex cloud ecosystem.
