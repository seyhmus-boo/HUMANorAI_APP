Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) represent distinct yet interconnected fields within computer science. AI, broadly defined, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, encompassing reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and perception.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on developing algorithms that allow systems to learn from and make predictions on data without explicit programming.  This learning process involves identifying patterns, extracting features, and building models that generalize to unseen data.  Supervised learning utilizes labeled datasets for training, while unsupervised learning explores unlabeled data to uncover inherent structures. Reinforcement learning, conversely, employs trial-and-error feedback mechanisms to optimize agent behavior within a defined environment.  The synergistic relationship between AI and ML is evident, with ML providing a crucial toolset for achieving many AI goals, driving advancements in various domains including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.  However, ethical considerations regarding bias, transparency, and accountability remain crucial challenges for responsible AI/ML development and deployment.
