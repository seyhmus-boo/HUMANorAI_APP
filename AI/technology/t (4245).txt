The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly transforming the landscape of domestic living, driving the proliferation of smart homes.  This lecture will briefly explore recent developments in this burgeoning field.  Fundamentally, IoT in smart homes involves the networking of everyday appliances and devices, enabling remote control, automation, and data-driven efficiency.

Recent advancements encompass enhanced interoperability through standardized protocols like Matter, facilitating seamless communication between devices from different manufacturers.  Artificial intelligence (AI) is playing an increasingly pivotal role, with machine learning algorithms powering predictive maintenance for appliances and personalized energy management systems.  Furthermore, advancements in low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs) are extending the reach and capabilities of IoT sensors, enabling real-time monitoring of environmental factors and security systems across larger areas.  Finally, robust cybersecurity measures are becoming increasingly crucial, addressing the inherent vulnerabilities of interconnected systems. The integration of these technologies promises a future of greater convenience, efficiency, and security within the domestic sphere.
