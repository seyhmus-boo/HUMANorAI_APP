Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).  Think of VR as stepping *into* a completely computer-generated world.  It's akin to fully immersing oneself in a meticulously crafted dream, where every sensory input is digitally orchestrated.  Headsets and haptic feedback devices facilitate this total sensory displacement, allowing users to explore virtual environments ranging from historical recreations to fantastical landscapes.

Conversely, AR overlays digital information onto the real world.  Imagine viewing a historical battlefield, and your smartphone screen displays annotations indicating troop movements and key battle positions â€“ that's AR in action.  It's like adding a translucent layer of contextual information to your immediate surroundings.  While VR aims for complete immersion, AR aims for contextual enhancement, improving our perception and interaction with the tangible world through the overlay of digital data.  Both technologies hold immense potential across diverse sectors, from gaming and entertainment to medicine and engineering.
