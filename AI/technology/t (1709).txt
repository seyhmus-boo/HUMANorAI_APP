Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations across diverse fields.  This abstract examines the burgeoning applications and interdisciplinary links inherent in AR/VR development and deployment.  Significant contributions come from computer science, encompassing graphics rendering, user interface design, and haptic feedback integration.  Psychology and human-computer interaction (HCI) are crucial for understanding user experience, presence, and the impact of immersive technologies on cognition and behavior.  Furthermore,  medicine benefits from AR/VR for surgical simulations, phobia treatments, and rehabilitation programs, while engineering employs these technologies for design visualization and collaborative prototyping.  Education utilizes AR/VR to create engaging and interactive learning environments, transcending geographical limitations.  The development of effective AR/VR systems necessitates expertise across these disciplines, emphasizing the need for collaborative research models that bridge the gap between technological advancements and effective application across diverse sectors. Future research should focus on addressing limitations such as motion sickness, cost-effectiveness, and the potential ethical implications of widespread AR/VR adoption.
