This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications.  While current AR/VR technologies rely primarily on classical computing, the inherent limitations in processing power and realism suggest a compelling need for quantum-enhanced solutions. We will examine potential applications where quantum computation could revolutionize AR/VR experiences. This includes improved rendering of realistic physics simulations, enabling interactions with highly complex virtual environments governed by quantum phenomena, and developing more intuitive and responsive interfaces.  Specific examples will include exploring quantum algorithms for real-time rendering of complex molecular structures in AR medical applications, or utilizing quantum machine learning for improved object recognition and tracking within VR environments.  Furthermore, we will discuss the challenges associated with implementing quantum-enhanced AR/VR, such as the need for robust quantum error correction and the development of suitable quantum hardware architectures.  Finally, we will outline potential future research directions, focusing on harnessing quantum entanglement for enhanced sensory feedback and developing quantum-secure communication protocols within AR/VR systems.  The integration of quantum mechanics promises a paradigm shift in the capabilities and immersive potential of AR/VR technologies.
