Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), while often used interchangeably, represent distinct yet deeply interconnected fields.  AI, with roots in the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, aims to create systems capable of intelligent behaviour, encompassing a broad spectrum of techniques.  Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, achieving limited success due to inherent computational constraints and the brittle nature of handcrafted rules.  The subsequent "AI winter" saw reduced funding and interest.

ML, a subset of AI, emerged as a powerful alternative, emphasizing the learning of patterns from data rather than explicit programming.  Early ML algorithms, like perceptrons, were simple, but the development of backpropagation and the availability of large datasets fueled a resurgence in the field.  The rise of deep learning, utilizing artificial neural networks with multiple layers, has revolutionized various applications, including image recognition, natural language processing, and autonomous systems.  While highly effective, concerns regarding bias, explainability, and ethical implications necessitate ongoing research and robust regulatory frameworks.  The ongoing evolution of AI and ML promises transformative impact across numerous sectors, but careful consideration of societal consequences remains paramount.
