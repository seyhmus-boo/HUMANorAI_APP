Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly expanding their application domains beyond entertainment, demonstrating significant potential across diverse sectors.  AR applications, overlaying digital information onto the real world, are increasingly utilized in fields such as manufacturing (e.g., providing real-time assembly instructions) and healthcare (e.g., surgical planning and training).  The immersive nature of VR, creating entirely simulated environments, offers unique advantages in areas including education (e.g., interactive historical simulations) and therapy (e.g., exposure therapy for phobias).  This convergence of technologies facilitates innovative solutions; for instance, remote collaboration through shared VR spaces is enhancing teamwork in design and engineering.  However, challenges remain.  High development costs, issues related to user experience including motion sickness and cognitive overload in VR, and concerns surrounding data privacy and security require ongoing research and development.  Future advancements in hardware, software, and human-computer interaction are crucial to realizing the full potential of AR and VR across a broader spectrum of societal applications.
