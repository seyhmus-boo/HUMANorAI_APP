Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrency, offers a decentralized, transparent, and secure platform with diverse applications beyond finance.  This paper explores the core principles of blockchain—distributed ledger technology, cryptographic hashing, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts—and examines their implications across various sectors.  The inherent immutability and auditability of blockchain enhance data integrity and security, making it suitable for applications requiring high trust and transparency.  Examples include supply chain management, where tracking goods from origin to consumer improves traceability and combats counterfeiting; healthcare, where secure and verifiable patient records enhance data privacy and interoperability; and digital identity management, offering secure and portable identity credentials.  However, challenges remain, including scalability limitations, regulatory uncertainty, and energy consumption associated with certain consensus mechanisms.  Further research is needed to optimize blockchain's performance and address these limitations to fully realize its potential across various domains.  This review highlights the transformative potential of blockchain technology while acknowledging the ongoing challenges requiring further investigation and development.
