Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming numerous scientific disciplines.  AI, broadly defined, seeks to imbue machines with human-like intelligence, akin to creating a sophisticated, programmable apprentice capable of learning and problem-solving.  ML, a subset of AI, provides the apprenticeship program: it allows machines to learn from data without explicit programming, much like a child learns to recognize a cat by observing numerous examples of cats, rather than being explicitly told its defining features.  This learning process often involves algorithms that identify patterns and relationships within data, analogous to a detective piecing together clues to solve a case.  Different ML approaches exist, including supervised learning (where the "teacher" provides labeled data), unsupervised learning (where the machine discovers patterns independently), and reinforcement learning (where the machine learns through trial and error, like a dog learning a trick).  The application of AI and ML spans diverse fields, including drug discovery (identifying potential drug candidates), climate modeling (predicting weather patterns), and medical diagnosis (analyzing medical images).  While offering immense potential, ethical considerations surrounding bias, transparency, and accountability remain crucial areas of ongoing research and debate.
