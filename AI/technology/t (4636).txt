This presentation explores experimental challenges in contemporary cybersecurity, moving beyond theoretical frameworks to examine practical hurdles in securing digital systems. We focus on three key areas:  first, the experimental validation of novel attack vectors.  Traditional vulnerability assessments often lag behind evolving threat landscapes;  this section presents our work on developing robust methodologies for proactively identifying and testing novel attack surfaces leveraging advanced machine learning techniques. Second, we address the challenge of evaluating the effectiveness of defensive mechanisms in real-world, dynamic environments. This involves the design and implementation of controlled experiments that accurately simulate complex network interactions, allowing for rigorous assessment of security protocols and incident response strategies. Finally, we investigate the inherent difficulties in conducting user-centric security experiments. We discuss the limitations of traditional usability testing in understanding user behaviour in the face of sophisticated phishing attacks or social engineering campaigns, proposing a novel experimental approach integrating behavioural economics and psychological modelling.  The presentation concludes by highlighting the need for a more experimental approach to cybersecurity research, emphasizing the critical role of rigorous empirical validation in ensuring the efficacy of security measures against increasingly sophisticated threats.
