This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), tracing their historical development and highlighting their contemporary significance.  Beginning with the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, which is widely considered the birthplace of AI, we will examine the field's initial optimism and subsequent periods of "AI winter" stemming from limitations in computational power and algorithmic sophistication.  The presentation will then delineate the crucial role of increased computing power and the availability of large datasets in the resurgence of AI, particularly driven by breakthroughs in deep learning. We will explore core ML techniques such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, emphasizing their distinct applications and limitations.  Furthermore, we will briefly address the ethical considerations arising from the increasing deployment of AI and ML in various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.  Finally, the presentation will conclude with a discussion of future trends and potential challenges facing the continued development and responsible application of these transformative technologies.
