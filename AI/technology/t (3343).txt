This presentation explores the rapidly evolving landscape of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, moving beyond the hype to examine their practical deployment across diverse sectors.  We will analyze the core technological distinctions between AR, which overlays digital information onto the real world, and VR, which immerses users in entirely simulated environments.  The discussion will then focus on specific real-world applications, showcasing the impact of these technologies.  Examples include their use in surgical planning and training within the medical field, enhancing employee training and simulations in industrial settings, and revolutionizing architectural visualization and design processes.  Furthermore, we will touch upon the emerging role of AR/VR in education, providing immersive learning experiences that foster deeper understanding and engagement.  The presentation will conclude by considering the challenges and ethical implications associated with widespread AR/VR adoption, including accessibility issues, data privacy concerns, and the potential for social disruption.  This overview aims to provide a balanced perspective on the current state and future potential of AR and VR technologies.
