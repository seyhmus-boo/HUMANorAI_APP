This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies.  While current AR/VR applications rely on classical computation, the inherent limitations of classical approaches, particularly in simulating complex systems and achieving realistic rendering, motivate the investigation of quantum computing's potential. We will discuss how quantum algorithms, such as quantum simulations and quantum machine learning, can revolutionize AR/VR development.  Specifically, we will examine the potential for quantum computation to improve rendering quality by enabling more accurate and efficient modeling of light and material interactions, leading to photorealistic virtual environments.  Furthermore, we will discuss the prospects of applying quantum machine learning to enhance user interaction and personalization within AR/VR experiences.  Challenges, including the scalability of quantum hardware and the development of appropriate quantum algorithms tailored to AR/VR applications, will be addressed. Finally, we will propose a research roadmap outlining key steps towards realizing a quantum-enhanced AR/VR ecosystem, fostering innovative applications across various domains, including medicine, engineering, and entertainment.
