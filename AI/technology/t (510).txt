Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have witnessed explosive growth, permeating numerous sectors and fundamentally altering technological landscapes.  However, despite significant advancements in algorithmic design and computational power, the experimental validation and robust deployment of AI/ML systems remain significantly challenged. This paper focuses on the key experimental obstacles hindering the field's progress towards truly reliable and generalizable AI. We address the limitations inherent in current benchmark datasets, highlighting issues such as bias, representational insufficiency, and the lack of ecological validity.  Furthermore, we examine the challenges posed by the "black box" nature of many sophisticated AI models, impeding interpretability and the ability to diagnose and correct errors effectively. The difficulties in establishing consistent evaluation metrics across diverse applications and the computational cost associated with training and validating large-scale models further compound these challenges.  Ultimately, this paper argues that addressing these experimental hurdles is crucial for advancing the trustworthiness, reliability, and widespread adoption of AI/ML technologies beyond current limitations.
