This presentation surveys the evolution of cloud computing, from its nascent stages as utility computing to its current ubiquitous presence across diverse sectors.  We trace the historical trajectory, highlighting pivotal shifts from early virtualization technologies to the emergence of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models.  Particular emphasis is placed on recent, significant developments.  These include the rise of serverless computing, facilitating event-driven architectures and minimizing operational overhead; advancements in edge computing, addressing latency concerns and enabling localized data processing; and the growing sophistication of AI-powered cloud management tools, improving resource optimization and predictive analysis.  Furthermore, the presentation will examine the increasing focus on sustainability within the cloud computing landscape, driven by concerns regarding energy consumption and carbon footprint.  Finally, we discuss emerging trends, such as quantum computing's potential integration and the ongoing challenges related to data security and regulatory compliance in this rapidly evolving technological environment.
