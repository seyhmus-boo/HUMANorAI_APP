This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, tracing their historical development and examining current trends.  Early conceptualizations of immersive technologies date back to the mid-20th century, with Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) and Ivan Sutherland's "The Ultimate Display" (1968) laying crucial groundwork.  However, technological limitations hindered widespread adoption until recent advancements in computing power, display technologies, and sensor integration.

This presentation will analyze the key distinctions between AR and VR, highlighting how AR overlays digital information onto the real world, while VR creates entirely simulated environments. We will then examine a diverse range of applications spanning various sectors.  Examples include the utilization of VR in medical training for surgical simulations, its application in architectural visualization, and AR's role in enhancing industrial maintenance through interactive manuals. Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the potential societal impact of these technologies, including implications for education, entertainment, and accessibility, while also acknowledging the challenges related to user experience design, data privacy, and the potential for digital divide exacerbation. Finally, future research directions and the ongoing evolution of AR/VR technologies will be briefly considered.
