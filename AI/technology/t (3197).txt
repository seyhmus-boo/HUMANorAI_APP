Blockchain technology, while promising transformative applications across diverse sectors, faces significant experimental challenges hindering its widespread adoption. This presentation examines key obstacles encountered in practical implementations of blockchain solutions.  We will discuss the limitations of current consensus mechanisms, focusing on scalability issues and the trade-off between decentralization, security, and throughput.  The energy consumption of proof-of-work consensus, particularly its environmental impact, will be critically analyzed, along with the exploration of alternative, more energy-efficient consensus models.  Furthermore, we will address the challenges posed by data privacy and regulatory uncertainty, highlighting the complexities of achieving compliance within decentralized frameworks.  Finally, the presentation will delve into the difficulty of integrating blockchain systems with existing legacy infrastructure, and the need for user-friendly interfaces to facilitate broader accessibility and adoption. We conclude by outlining areas requiring further research to overcome these experimental challenges and unlock the full potential of blockchain technology.
