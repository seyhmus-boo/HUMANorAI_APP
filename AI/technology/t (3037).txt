This presentation addresses the evolving landscape of cybersecurity challenges and emerging solutions.  Recent advancements in technology, while offering unprecedented opportunities, have simultaneously broadened the attack surface for malicious actors.  We will explore the increasingly sophisticated nature of cyber threats, including the rise of AI-powered attacks,  the proliferation of ransomware as a service, and the persistent challenge of supply chain vulnerabilities.  The discussion will analyze the impact of these threats on critical infrastructure, businesses, and individual users.  Furthermore, the presentation will examine recent developments in defensive strategies, focusing on the application of advanced machine learning techniques for threat detection and response, the evolution of zero trust architectures, and the growing importance of robust cybersecurity education and workforce development.  Finally, we will consider the ethical implications of deploying advanced technologies for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity purposes, highlighting the need for responsible innovation and international cooperation in mitigating global cyber risks.  The aim is to provide an overview of the current state of cybersecurity and to stimulate discussion regarding effective strategies for enhancing global cyber resilience.
