Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly intertwined fields driving technological advancements.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This learning process involves algorithms that identify patterns, make predictions, and improve performance over time through iterative exposure to data.  Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning represent distinct approaches within ML, each suited to different types of data and learning objectives.  The synergy between AI and ML is evident in applications ranging from autonomous vehicles and medical diagnosis to natural language processing and fraud detection.  However, challenges remain, including addressing biases in training data, ensuring algorithmic transparency and accountability, and mitigating ethical concerns surrounding autonomous decision-making systems.  Further research is crucial to enhance the robustness, explainability, and societal impact of AI and ML systems.
