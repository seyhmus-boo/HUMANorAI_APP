Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, fostering significant interdisciplinary collaboration across computer science, psychology, engineering, and design. This abstract highlights the key interdisciplinary links driving advancements in AR/VR applications.  Computer science underpins the technological foundation, encompassing areas like 3D modelling, rendering, and human-computer interaction.  Psychology plays a crucial role in understanding user experience, cognitive load, and the impact of immersive environments on behaviour and emotion.  Engineering contributes to hardware development, encompassing miniaturization, sensor integration, and display technologies.  Finally, design disciplines, including human-centred design and interaction design, are essential for creating intuitive and effective user interfaces and experiences.  The synergy between these fields is crucial for addressing challenges such as motion sickness, realistic rendering, and the development of ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and immersive experiences.  Future research should focus on strengthening these interdisciplinary collaborations to fully exploit the potential of AR/VR in diverse applications, ranging from healthcare and education to entertainment and industrial training. The ultimate goal is to leverage the unique capabilities of these technologies for impactful and beneficial societal outcomes.
