This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, highlighting their significant interdisciplinary potential.  Beyond their established presence in gaming and entertainment, AR/VR technologies are rapidly transforming diverse sectors, demanding collaboration across traditionally separate disciplines. We will examine key interdisciplinary links, focusing on: (1) **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI):**  investigating the design of intuitive and effective interfaces for immersive experiences, considering factors like user comfort, accessibility, and cognitive load. (2) **Computer Science & Engineering:**  exploring the computational demands of real-time rendering, tracking, and data processing required for seamless AR/VR integration. (3) **Cognitive Psychology & Neuroscience:**  analyzing the impact of immersive environments on perception, cognition, and behaviour, informing the design of applications for therapeutic interventions, education, and training. (4) **Design & Art:**  discussing the creative possibilities afforded by AR/VR for artistic expression, interactive storytelling, and architectural visualization.  The presentation will conclude by emphasizing the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration to address ethical considerations, accessibility challenges, and the full potential of AR/VR technologies across a range of applications, ultimately fostering a more comprehensive understanding and responsible development of this transformative technology.
