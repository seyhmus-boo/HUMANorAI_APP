This presentation examines the evolving landscape of cybersecurity challenges and explores contemporary solutions.  Historically, cybersecurity concerns were primarily focused on protecting physical infrastructure from unauthorized access, mirroring the limitations of early computing systems.  The advent of the internet, however, dramatically expanded the attack surface, ushering in a new era of sophisticated cyber threats ranging from malware and phishing attacks to large-scale data breaches and state-sponsored espionage.  This expansion necessitated a shift from perimeter-based security to a more holistic, layered approach.

The presentation will analyze key challenges, including the proliferation of IoT devices increasing vulnerability points, the persistent evolution of malware and ransomware techniques, and the growing sophistication of social engineering tactics. Furthermore, it will discuss the limitations of current cybersecurity frameworks in addressing emerging threats such as AI-driven attacks and the increasing complexity of supply chain vulnerabilities. Finally, the presentation will explore promising solutions, focusing on advancements in threat intelligence, AI-powered security systems, robust authentication methods, and the crucial role of cybersecurity awareness training and education in mitigating risk.  The ultimate aim is to provide an overview of the ongoing arms race between cybercriminals and defenders, highlighting the need for proactive and adaptive strategies to ensure a secure digital future.
