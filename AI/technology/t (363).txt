This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in developing and evaluating augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications.  While AR and VR technologies offer transformative potential across diverse fields, rigorous experimentation presents unique methodological hurdles.  We will focus on three key challenges: (1)  **Ecological Validity:**  Replicating real-world contexts within controlled experimental settings remains difficult, impacting the generalizability of findings. The trade-off between experimental control and realism necessitates careful consideration of study design and participant selection. (2) **Participant Experience:**  Issues such as simulator sickness, motion discomfort, and cognitive load significantly influence participant behaviour and data quality, requiring careful attention to user experience design and mitigation strategies. (3) **Data Collection and Analysis:**  The rich, multi-modal data generated by AR/VR systems (e.g., physiological measures, eye-tracking, behavioural logs) present complexities in data acquisition, cleaning, and analysis, necessitating the development of novel analytical techniques. The presentation will conclude by highlighting emerging best practices and suggesting avenues for future research addressing these critical experimental challenges to ensure robust and reliable evaluation of AR and VR applications.
