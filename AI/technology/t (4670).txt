The advent of quantum computing presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges for cybersecurity.  Current cryptographic systems, relying on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithm problems, are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers.  This abstract explores the quantum mechanical underpinnings of these vulnerabilities, focusing on Shor's algorithm's ability to efficiently break RSA and ECC encryption.  We discuss the urgent need for post-quantum cryptography (PQC), highlighting the various approaches being investigated, including lattice-based, code-based, multivariate, and hash-based cryptography.  These PQC algorithms, drawing on the complexities of underlying mathematical problems resistant to quantum attacks, are analyzed for their security strengths and practical implementation challenges.  Further, the abstract addresses the potential quantum-enhanced attacks against classical security protocols, such as enhanced side-channel analysis.  Finally, we examine the prospect of quantum key distribution (QKD), leveraging quantum mechanics to provide unconditionally secure communication, as a crucial element of a future quantum-resistant security infrastructure.  The development and deployment of PQC and QKD represent critical steps in mitigating the impending threat to global cybersecurity posed by quantum computing.
