Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the ascendance of autonomous vehicles.  Consider the evolution of flight: initially, piloting demanded exceptional skill, mirroring the current state of driving.  Then, advancements in autopilot technology gradually offloaded certain tasks, akin to the current deployment of advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS).  Autonomous vehicles represent the next logical step – the complete automation of the piloting function, analogous to a fully automated aircraft.

This transition isn't a sudden leap, but a gradual climb up a technological mountain.  We're witnessing the layering of increasingly sophisticated sensors, like a complex network of eyes and ears, coupled with powerful computational brains processing vast amounts of data in real-time. Think of a chess grandmaster, not simply reacting to moves, but anticipating them through deep understanding of the game, and that is the ambition of AI in driving. The challenges remain significant – tackling edge cases, ensuring safety protocols, and addressing ethical dilemmas.  However, the trajectory indicates a future where autonomous vehicles, much like automated flight, will become commonplace, revolutionising transportation as we know it.
