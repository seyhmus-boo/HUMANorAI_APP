Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly expanding their applications across diverse sectors.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices such as smartphones and smart glasses.  This finds utility in fields like healthcare, enabling surgeons with real-time anatomical data during procedures, and in education, providing interactive learning experiences.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, offering applications ranging from training simulations in hazardous industries (e.g., flight training, surgical practice) to therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD.  The convergence of AR and VR is further driving innovation, creating mixed reality (MR) experiences that blend real and virtual worlds seamlessly.  However, challenges remain, including the high cost of development and deployment, the potential for motion sickness and cyber sickness in VR, and concerns regarding data privacy and security.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations and exploring novel applications of these technologies in areas such as remote collaboration, design visualization, and personalized entertainment experiences, ultimately maximizing their societal impact.
