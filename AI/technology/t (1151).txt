The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) presents significant experimental challenges hindering widespread deployment.  One key area is sensor fusion.  Accurately integrating data from diverse sensors – LiDAR, radar, cameras – in real-time to create a robust and reliable perception of the environment remains a substantial hurdle.  Variability in weather conditions, particularly adverse weather like heavy rain or snow, severely impacts sensor performance, leading to inaccurate object detection and localization.

Furthermore, edge cases pose a persistent problem.  Programming AVs to navigate unpredictable human behaviour, such as jaywalking or unexpected lane changes, requires sophisticated AI algorithms capable of handling ambiguity and uncertainty.  Ethical dilemmas arising from unavoidable accident scenarios necessitate the development of robust decision-making frameworks, a task that combines engineering and philosophical considerations.  Finally, the sheer volume of data required for training and validating AV systems presents computational and storage challenges, demanding innovative solutions in high-performance computing and data management.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is crucial for realizing the full potential of autonomous driving.
