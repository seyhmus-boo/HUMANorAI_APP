The Internet of Things (IoT) has profoundly impacted residential environments, giving rise to the concept of the smart home. This abstract explores the burgeoning field of IoT in domestic settings, focusing on practical applications and associated implications. Smart homes leverage interconnected devices, encompassing sensors, actuators, and computational units, communicating via diverse networks to automate tasks and enhance user experience.  Applications span energy management, where smart thermostats and appliances optimize consumption; security systems, integrating intrusion detection and remote monitoring; and home automation, automating lighting, appliances, and entertainment systems via voice control or scheduled events.  Further applications include health monitoring, using wearable sensors and smart medication dispensers, and assisted living technologies for elderly populations.  While offering significant benefits in convenience, efficiency, and safety, challenges remain, including data privacy concerns, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and the potential for digital divides based on socioeconomic factors.  Future research should focus on developing robust security protocols, user-friendly interfaces, and equitable access to these technologies to maximize the societal benefits of IoT in smart homes.
