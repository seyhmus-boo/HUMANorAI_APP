This presentation provides a concise overview of the rapidly evolving fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), emphasizing their transformative impact across diverse sectors.  We begin by defining core concepts, differentiating between various AI approaches (e.g., symbolic AI, connectionist AI) and highlighting the central role of ML in achieving intelligent systems.  The presentation will explore key ML algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning techniques, illustrating their application with real-world examples from fields such as healthcare (diagnostic tools), finance (fraud detection), and natural language processing (chatbots).  Furthermore, we will address current challenges and limitations, such as data bias, explainability ("black box" problem), and ethical considerations surrounding AI deployment.  The presentation concludes by examining future research directions and the potential societal implications of increasingly sophisticated AI and ML systems, encouraging a critical discussion about responsible innovation and the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in navigating this technological frontier.
