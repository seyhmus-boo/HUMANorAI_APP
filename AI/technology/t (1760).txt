This presentation explores the rapidly expanding field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), emphasizing its crucial interdisciplinary nature.  While traditionally rooted in computer science and mathematics, the transformative potential of AI/ML is increasingly realized through collaborations across diverse disciplines.  We will examine key interdisciplinary links, including the application of AI/ML in biomedical sciences (e.g., drug discovery, personalized medicine), social sciences (e.g., sentiment analysis, predictive policing), and humanities (e.g., digital humanities, stylistic analysis).  The presentation will highlight both the opportunities and challenges arising from these collaborations.  Specific examples will illustrate how integrating diverse perspectives – from ethical considerations raised by algorithmic bias to the need for human-centered design in AI systems – is crucial for responsible and impactful AI development.  Furthermore, we will discuss the need for interdisciplinary education and training programs to cultivate the next generation of AI researchers and practitioners who can effectively navigate the complex ethical and societal implications of this transformative technology.  The concluding remarks will focus on fostering stronger interdisciplinary research networks to unlock the full potential of AI/ML for the benefit of society.
