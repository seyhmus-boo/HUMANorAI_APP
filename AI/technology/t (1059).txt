The burgeoning field of quantum computing faces significant experimental hurdles on its path to widespread applicability. This presentation will explore key experimental challenges hindering the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers.  We will discuss the limitations of current qubit technologies, focusing on coherence times, gate fidelities, and scalability issues inherent in different platforms such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and photonic systems.  The difficulty in achieving high-fidelity quantum gates, exacerbated by noise and decoherence, will be highlighted, alongside the significant engineering challenges associated with scaling up the number of qubits while maintaining control and connectivity.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the critical need for improved error correction techniques to mitigate the effects of noise and achieve fault tolerance.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the development of robust and scalable quantum control systems, crucial for manipulating large-scale quantum registers.  Addressing these experimental limitations is paramount for transitioning from proof-of-principle demonstrations to the construction of powerful, practical quantum computers.
