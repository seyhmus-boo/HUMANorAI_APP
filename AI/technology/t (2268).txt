Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the evolution of cloud computing.  Initially, imagine computing resources as a private, on-site power plant – expensive to build and maintain, with limited scalability.  This represents the pre-cloud era, where companies owned and managed their own IT infrastructure.

The advent of cloud computing, however, can be likened to the development of the national grid.  Instead of individual power plants, a centralized network provides electricity on demand, drastically reducing individual cost and complexity.  This utility computing model, the first stage of cloud evolution, offered Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), essentially renting raw computing power.

Subsequently, cloud services evolved, mirroring the development of sophisticated electrical appliances.  Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) emerged, providing pre-built platforms for application development, analogous to ready-to-use ovens rather than raw electricity.  Finally, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) represents the most advanced stage, akin to purchasing pre-cooked meals – fully functional software accessible via the internet, eliminating the need for local installation and maintenance.  This continuous evolution towards greater abstraction and ease of use continues to shape the digital landscape.
