The convergence of classical cybersecurity vulnerabilities and the emerging threat of quantum computing presents a significant challenge to information security.  This review examines the multifaceted nature of this problem, focusing on the quantum mechanical implications.  Post-quantum cryptography (PQC), a critical area of research, addresses the threat of quantum computers breaking currently employed public-key cryptosystems.  However, the transition to PQC presents its own hurdles, including performance overhead and the complexities of algorithm migration and key management.  Furthermore, quantum key distribution (QKD), leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics for secure key exchange, offers a promising alternative, though its scalability and vulnerability to side-channel attacks remain active research areas.  Beyond cryptography, quantum annealing and other quantum algorithms pose threats to established cryptographic hashing and integrity verification methods.  Solutions necessitate a holistic approach encompassing PQC adoption, robust QKD infrastructure development,  and the exploration of novel quantum-resistant algorithms.  Further research should investigate the interplay between quantum computing's inherent randomness and the potential for novel attack vectors, necessitating a paradigm shift in our understanding and implementation of cybersecurity strategies.
