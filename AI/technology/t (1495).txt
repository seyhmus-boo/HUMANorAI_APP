Cybersecurity faces escalating challenges driven by the increasing interconnectedness of systems and the sophistication of cyberattacks.  This necessitates an interdisciplinary approach to effective mitigation.  Traditional computer science solutions, focusing on technical safeguards like encryption and intrusion detection, are insufficient against evolving threats.  This abstract highlights the critical need for integration with other disciplines.  Behavioral science contributes insights into human vulnerabilities, informing the design of robust user authentication and security awareness training programs.  Legal and policy frameworks are crucial for establishing accountability and deterring malicious actors, while sociological studies illuminate the societal implications of cybercrime and inform public policy development.  Furthermore, collaboration between disciplines is vital in addressing the ethical dilemmas posed by advanced technologies like artificial intelligence in cybersecurity.  Effective solutions require a holistic approach integrating technical expertise with insights from behavioral science, law, sociology, and ethics to create resilient and adaptable cybersecurity infrastructure, policies, and practices.  Future research should focus on strengthening these interdisciplinary links to proactively address the dynamic nature of cyber threats.
