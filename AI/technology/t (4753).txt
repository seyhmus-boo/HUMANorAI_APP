Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct concepts.  Think of AI as the overarching goal: to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation.  ML, in contrast, is a crucial *method* for achieving this goal.  It's analogous to teaching a dog a trick: AI is the aspiration of having a highly intelligent canine companion, while ML is the process of training the dog through repetition and reward.  Instead of treats, ML algorithms are "trained" on vast datasets, learning patterns and relationships within the data.  This learning process, often iterative and adaptive, allows the algorithm to improve its performance over time without explicit programming for each specific scenario.  Imagine a spam filter: AI is the overall objective of accurately classifying emails, while ML is the technique employed to learn which characteristics—word choices, sender information, etc.—distinguish spam from legitimate messages. Thus, ML provides a powerful toolkit for realizing various AI applications, although AI encompasses broader approaches beyond purely data-driven learning.
