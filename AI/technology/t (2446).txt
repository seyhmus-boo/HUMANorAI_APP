Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, with roots in the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, encompasses the broader goal of creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, problem-solving, and learning.  Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, aiming to codify human knowledge into explicit rules. However, limitations in scalability and the difficulty of representing nuanced real-world knowledge spurred the rise of ML, a subfield of AI. ML, emerging more prominently in the late 20th century, eschews explicit programming in favour of algorithms that allow systems to learn from data.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on statistical analysis of large datasets. This paradigm shift, coupled with advances in computing power and the availability of vast amounts of digital data, has driven the recent surge in AI's capabilities, exemplified by breakthroughs in deep learning and neural networks. The relationship between AI and ML is therefore best understood as one of a broader goal (AI) and a powerful technique (ML) used to achieve that goal, with ongoing research continually refining their interplay.
