Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture will delineate the crucial distinction between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), two frequently conflated concepts.  AI, the broader field, encompasses the creation of intelligent agents capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on input data.

This distinction is crucial because while AI aims to replicate human cognitive functions, ML provides a specific methodology for achieving this.  Practical applications of ML are ubiquitous.  Spam filters utilize ML to identify unwanted emails, recommendation systems on platforms like Netflix leverage ML to suggest content, and medical diagnosis tools employ ML to analyze medical images and predict diseases.  In essence, ML empowers AI systems to adapt and improve their performance over time, driving innovation across numerous sectors.  We will delve further into specific ML algorithms in subsequent lectures.
