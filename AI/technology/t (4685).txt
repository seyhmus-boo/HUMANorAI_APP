This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), highlighting its increasingly significant interdisciplinary connections. While traditionally rooted in computer science, the transformative potential of AI/ML is now driving collaborations across diverse domains.  We will examine key interdisciplinary links, focusing on their synergistic effects and challenges.  Examples will include the application of AI/ML in biomedical research (e.g., drug discovery, personalized medicine),  environmental science (e.g., climate modeling, species conservation), and the social sciences (e.g., analyzing social networks, predicting human behavior).  The presentation will discuss the ethical implications arising from these collaborations, such as data bias and algorithmic fairness, which necessitate interdisciplinary dialogue and robust regulatory frameworks.  Furthermore, we will briefly analyze the current limitations and future directions of AI/ML research, emphasizing the crucial need for continued interdisciplinary collaboration to fully harness its potential while mitigating inherent risks.  Ultimately, we argue that a truly holistic understanding and responsible development of AI/ML require a concerted effort from researchers across various disciplines.
