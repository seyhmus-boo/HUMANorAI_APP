This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in developing and evaluating Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications.  While offering transformative potential across diverse fields,  AR/VR research encounters significant methodological hurdles.  We address key issues, including the elicitation of ecologically valid user behaviour within immersive environments,  the inherent difficulty in controlling extraneous variables, and the limitations of existing psychometric tools adapted for AR/VR contexts.  Specifically, we discuss the challenges of establishing objective ground truth in user experience evaluations, the complexities of measuring physiological responses indicative of presence and engagement, and the biases introduced by the novelty effect and simulator sickness.  Furthermore, we analyze the ethical considerations surrounding data collection and informed consent within immersive technologies. This presentation argues that a multi-faceted approach, incorporating rigorous experimental design, innovative data acquisition techniques, and a careful consideration of ethical implications, is crucial for advancing the field and ensuring the responsible development of effective AR/VR applications.  We conclude by suggesting avenues for future research aimed at mitigating these challenges.
