This presentation examines contemporary cybersecurity challenges and emerging solutions within the rapidly evolving digital landscape.  Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have simultaneously exacerbated and mitigated these challenges.  While AI-powered attacks, such as sophisticated phishing campaigns and autonomous malware, pose significant threats, AI also offers powerful defensive capabilities.  We will explore the application of machine learning in threat detection and response, analyzing its effectiveness in identifying zero-day exploits and predicting future attack vectors.  Furthermore, the presentation addresses the increasing complexities of data privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA, examining the challenges of maintaining compliance while leveraging the benefits of cloud computing and big data analytics.  Finally, we delve into the crucial role of human factors in cybersecurity, highlighting the limitations of technological solutions in the face of social engineering and insider threats.  The presentation concludes by outlining promising avenues for future research, including the development of more robust and adaptable cybersecurity frameworks that integrate AI, robust data governance, and comprehensive employee training programs.
