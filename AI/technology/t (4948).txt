Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources, including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence, has evolved dramatically since its conceptual origins.  Early forms can be traced back to time-sharing systems of the 1960s and 1970s, which allowed multiple users to access a central mainframe.  However, the true genesis of modern cloud computing is frequently attributed to the emergence of the internet and the development of virtualization technologies in the late 1990s and early 2000s.  Virtualization enabled the efficient allocation of physical resources, laying the groundwork for the large-scale, multi-tenant infrastructure that characterizes contemporary cloud services.  The early 2000s witnessed the rise of companies like Amazon, offering Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) through platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS), fundamentally shifting the paradigm from on-premise infrastructure to remotely accessed resources.  This was followed by the development of Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS) models, further streamlining development and deployment processes.  The subsequent evolution has involved the incorporation of advanced technologies like big data analytics, artificial intelligence, and serverless computing, continuously expanding the capabilities and applications of cloud computing across diverse sectors.
