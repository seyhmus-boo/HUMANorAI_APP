This presentation offers a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), tracing their historical development and highlighting their current impact.  The field's origins can be traced back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, where the term "artificial intelligence" was coined, fueled by initial optimism regarding symbolic reasoning and problem-solving.  Early successes in game playing and theorem proving were followed by periods of disillusionment, known as "AI winters," due to limitations in computational power and algorithmic sophistication.

The resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributed to advancements in ML, particularly deep learning.  This presentation will explore key ML paradigms, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, illustrating their applications across diverse domains including computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.  We will discuss the ethical considerations surrounding AI's increasing prevalence, addressing issues of bias, transparency, and accountability.  Finally, the presentation will briefly examine future directions in AI research, focusing on the potential for general-purpose AI and the ongoing quest for truly intelligent systems.
