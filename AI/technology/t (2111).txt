The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a paradigm shift in transportation comparable to the transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles.  This presentation explores the key factors driving this technological leap, employing accessible analogies to illuminate complex concepts.  Just as the invention of the internal combustion engine revolutionized personal mobility, advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in computer vision and machine learning, are powering the AV revolution.  We can consider the AV's sensor suite as analogous to a driver's senses, constantly processing information from the environment.  Sophisticated algorithms, the equivalent of a skilled driver's decision-making processes, interpret this data to navigate safely.  However, the transition to widespread AV adoption faces challenges.  The ethical considerations surrounding accident liability mirror the societal adjustments needed during the initial adoption of automobiles, with questions of responsibility analogous to those surrounding the development of liability insurance.  Furthermore, the required infrastructure upgrades –  equivalent to building a nationwide network of standardized roadways –  represent a significant hurdle.  This presentation will analyze these parallel historical and technological aspects, highlighting the opportunities and challenges inherent in this transformative technology.
