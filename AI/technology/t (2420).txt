This presentation traces the evolution of cloud computing from its nascent stages to its current ubiquitous presence, highlighting key technological advancements and shifts in deployment models.  We will examine the progression from early grid computing initiatives to the emergence of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), focusing on the interplay between virtualization, containerization, and serverless architectures.

Recent developments will be a central focus, including the rise of edge computing as a response to latency concerns and the increasing demand for data processing closer to the source.  We will also discuss the growing importance of serverless computing and its implications for application development and deployment, alongside advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) integrated within cloud platforms.  Further, the presentation will briefly address the ongoing challenges, such as data security, privacy concerns, and vendor lock-in,  and discuss potential future directions including quantum computing's potential impact on cloud infrastructure.  The presentation concludes with a discussion of the broader societal implications of cloud computingâ€™s continued evolution.
