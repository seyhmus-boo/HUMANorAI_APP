Blockchain technology, at its core, is a distributed, immutable ledger maintaining a chronologically ordered chain of records, or blocks.  Each block cryptographically links to its predecessor, ensuring data integrity and transparency. This decentralized architecture eliminates the need for a central authority, enhancing security and trust.  Applications stem from this fundamental structure.

Practical applications are diverse.  Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin utilize blockchain for secure and transparent transaction processing, bypassing traditional financial intermediaries.  Supply chain management benefits from enhanced traceability, allowing for verification of product origin and authenticity.  Healthcare can leverage blockchain for secure storage and sharing of patient medical records, improving data privacy and interoperability.  Furthermore, digital identity management systems can be built on blockchain, offering robust and verifiable identities.  The inherent immutability and transparency contribute to the growing adoption of blockchain across various sectors, promising significant improvements in efficiency, security, and trust.  However, scalability and regulatory challenges remain areas of ongoing research and development.
