This presentation explores the multifaceted nature of contemporary cybersecurity challenges and the critical need for interdisciplinary solutions.  While technological advancements constantly evolve cyber threats, addressing them effectively requires a move beyond purely technical approaches.  We argue that a holistic understanding, incorporating perspectives from sociology, psychology, law, and economics, is crucial for robust cybersecurity strategies.  We will examine specific examples where interdisciplinary collaboration has proven impactful, such as the application of behavioral economics to phishing resistance and the use of sociological research to understand the spread of misinformation online.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the legal and ethical dilemmas posed by emerging technologies like AI and IoT, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary frameworks to govern their development and deployment. Finally, we propose a model for fostering greater interdisciplinary collaboration in cybersecurity research and practice, advocating for integrated curricula, cross-disciplinary research funding, and collaborative industry-academia partnerships.  This approach is vital for developing resilient and adaptable cybersecurity measures in an increasingly interconnected world.
