The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology marks a significant paradigm shift in transportation. This presentation examines the key factors driving the rise of AVs, analyzing their technological underpinnings, economic implications, and societal impact.  We explore the convergence of artificial intelligence, sensor technologies (LiDAR, radar, cameras), and high-precision mapping that enables the perception, planning, and control functionalities crucial for autonomous driving.  Furthermore, the presentation delves into the evolving regulatory landscape and its influence on AV deployment, highlighting the challenges posed by safety concerns, liability issues, and ethical dilemmas surrounding accident responsibility and job displacement.  The economic analysis will encompass potential benefits, such as increased efficiency and reduced congestion, alongside challenges like infrastructure investment and the disruption of existing transportation industries.  Finally, we discuss the societal implications, including accessibility improvements for vulnerable populations and the potential for transformative changes in urban planning and social interaction, alongside concerns about data privacy and algorithmic bias. The presentation concludes by offering a perspective on the future trajectory of AV technology and its profound impact on our lives.
