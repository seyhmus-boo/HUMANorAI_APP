Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation.  Its conceptual roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, widely considered the birthplace of AI as a field of study.  Early efforts focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, attempting to codify human knowledge into explicit rules.  However, these approaches struggled with the complexities of real-world problems.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of relying on explicitly programmed rules, ML algorithms learn patterns and insights from large datasets, adapting and improving their performance without explicit programming. This paradigm shift, driven by increasing computational power and data availability, has fueled the recent surge in AI capabilities.  Different ML approaches, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, have been developed to tackle various learning tasks, leading to breakthroughs in fields ranging from natural language processing to computer vision and robotics.  The intertwined evolution of AI and ML continues to redefine technological possibilities and reshape numerous aspects of human society.
