This presentation examines the evolution of cloud computing, highlighting key experimental challenges encountered throughout its development and ongoing deployment.  Early iterations focused on virtualization and resource allocation, presenting challenges in achieving efficient and scalable resource management within virtualized environments.  Experiments aimed at optimizing these processes often encountered limitations in network bandwidth, storage latency, and the unpredictable nature of shared resources.  The shift towards serverless architectures and microservices introduced new complexities, including cold starts, function orchestration, and the management of ephemeral resources.  Experimentation in these areas requires robust monitoring and fault-tolerance mechanisms to understand the performance trade-offs inherent in distributed, event-driven systems.  Furthermore, the increasing prevalence of edge computing introduces further experimental challenges related to latency optimization, data security, and the management of heterogeneous hardware and software environments.  This presentation will survey these experimental challenges, discussing open research questions and future directions for research within the context of cloud computing's continued evolution towards greater efficiency, scalability, and security.
