Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration across diverse fields. This abstract explores the burgeoning applications and interdisciplinary links driving advancements in AR/VR.  Computer science underpins the development of sophisticated hardware and software, enabling realistic immersive experiences.  Human-computer interaction (HCI) research is crucial for designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, addressing issues of usability, accessibility, and user experience.  Furthermore, psychology plays a vital role in understanding the cognitive and affective impacts of AR/VR, informing the design of applications for therapeutic interventions, training simulations, and educational tools.  Other crucial disciplines include design, engineering, and medicine.  Medical applications range from surgical planning and training to therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD.  Engineering leverages AR/VR for design visualization and remote collaboration, enhancing productivity and safety.  The integration of these disciplines drives innovation across sectors, leading to advancements in areas such as entertainment, education, healthcare, and manufacturing.  Future research should focus on addressing ethical concerns, ensuring equitable access, and maximizing the potential of AR/VR across diverse societal contexts.
