Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related approaches to mediating human perception and interaction with the environment. AR overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real world, enhancing users' perception of their surroundings, while VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, disconnecting them from physical reality.  These technologies leverage advancements in computer graphics, sensor technology, and human-computer interaction to create compelling experiences.

Practical applications are diverse and rapidly expanding.  In medicine, AR is utilized for surgical planning and guidance, while VR facilitates phobia treatments and surgical training simulations.  Engineering and design benefit from VR for prototyping and collaborative design reviews, allowing for immersive exploration of complex models.  Furthermore, AR finds applications in retail, providing virtual try-on experiences and interactive product demonstrations.  In education, both AR and VR offer immersive learning environments, potentially revolutionizing traditional pedagogical approaches by fostering active engagement and knowledge retention. The continued development and integration of these technologies promise transformative effects across numerous sectors.
