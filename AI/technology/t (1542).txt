This presentation addresses the experimental hurdles currently impeding the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers.  While theoretical advancements continue to refine quantum algorithms and error correction codes, significant challenges remain in the physical implementation of scalable and stable quantum systems.  We will examine key limitations across diverse hardware platforms, including superconducting qubits, trapped ions, and photonic systems.  A central focus will be on coherence times, emphasizing the need for improved qubit control and environmental decoupling to mitigate decoherence.  Furthermore, the scalability bottleneck, arising from the difficulty of fabricating and controlling a large number of high-fidelity qubits with low crosstalk, will be discussed.  We will assess the progress made in tackling these challenges, highlighting recent advancements in materials science, fabrication techniques, and control methodologies.  Finally, we will explore potential avenues for future research, such as topological quantum computation and the development of novel quantum architectures to overcome these experimental limitations and pave the way towards practical quantum computation.
