Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly transforming various sectors, offering immersive experiences that bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds.  AR, analogous to overlaying a transparent digital map onto a physical city, enhances the user's perception of reality by superimposing computer-generated information onto their real-world view. This is exemplified by applications in medical training, where surgeons can practice complex procedures on virtual organs overlaid onto a real patient's body. Conversely, VR, akin to stepping into a fully simulated environment, creates entirely artificial experiences, isolating the user from the physical world.  This enables applications in therapeutic contexts, such as exposure therapy for phobias, where patients confront their fears in a controlled virtual environment, analogous to a carefully constructed and adjustable theatrical stage.  While both technologies are distinct, their convergence is creating hybrid applications—imagine a virtual meeting room projected onto a physical conference table—blurring the lines between augmented and virtual experiences.  Future research should focus on optimizing user interface design, addressing potential issues such as motion sickness and cognitive overload, and exploring the ethical implications of these increasingly pervasive technologies.
