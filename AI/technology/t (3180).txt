The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), sensor technology, and high-performance computing have propelled the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs). This presentation examines the key technological drivers and societal implications of this transformative development.  We will analyze the progression from Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) to fully autonomous vehicles, highlighting the challenges overcome in areas such as perception, planning, and control.  The role of machine learning algorithms in enabling robust object detection, path planning, and decision-making under uncertainty will be critically assessed. Furthermore, we will discuss the crucial ethical considerations surrounding AV deployment, including accident liability, data privacy, and potential job displacement within the transportation sector.  The presentation will conclude by evaluating the current regulatory landscape and future prospects of AV adoption, considering factors such as infrastructure readiness, public acceptance, and the ongoing competition amongst leading technology companies.  A comparative analysis of different AV architectures and their associated strengths and weaknesses will also be presented.
