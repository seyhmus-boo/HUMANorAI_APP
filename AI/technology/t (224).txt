This presentation explores the evolution of cloud computing, highlighting its increasingly interdisciplinary nature.  Initially conceived within computer science, cloud computing's impact now transcends disciplinary boundaries, profoundly influencing fields like economics, sociology, and environmental science.  We trace the trajectory from early grid computing models to the current landscape dominated by hyperscale providers, emphasizing key technological advancements such as virtualization, containerization, and serverless architectures.  Furthermore, we examine the socio-economic implications of cloud adoption, including issues of data privacy, security, and the digital divide.  The environmental footprint of cloud infrastructure, encompassing energy consumption and carbon emissions, will also be critically assessed.  Finally, we discuss emerging interdisciplinary research avenues, such as the application of cloud technologies in tackling complex societal challenges across healthcare, climate modeling, and sustainable development.  This presentation aims to foster a dialogue on the multifaceted nature of cloud computing and its ongoing transformative influence on society and the environment.
