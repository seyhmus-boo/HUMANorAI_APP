This presentation explores the emerging intersection of quantum mechanics and cybersecurity, focusing on both the unprecedented challenges and potential solutions offered by quantum technologies.  The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to current cryptographic systems, rendering widely used algorithms like RSA and ECC vulnerable to attacks through Shor's algorithm.  We will analyze this threat landscape, detailing the timescale of this vulnerability and its implications for data security across various sectors.  

Conversely, quantum mechanics also offers promising avenues for enhanced security.  Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms, resistant to quantum attacks, are being actively developed and standardized.  We will discuss the progress and limitations of several leading PQC candidates, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in practical implementations.  Furthermore, we will explore the potential of quantum key distribution (QKD) for unconditionally secure communication, leveraging the principles of quantum entanglement and measurement to guarantee secure key exchange.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the challenges in implementing and scaling these quantum-based security solutions, including infrastructure limitations and the need for robust standardization and interoperability.
