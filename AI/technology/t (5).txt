This presentation examines the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary collaborations driving its rapid advancement.  The rise of AVs necessitates a convergence of expertise from traditionally disparate fields.  We will explore the key contributions of computer science, focusing on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor fusion algorithms essential for perception, decision-making, and control.  Furthermore, the critical role of engineering, encompassing mechanical, electrical, and software engineering, in developing robust and safe vehicle platforms will be discussed.  Beyond the technological aspects, the societal implications demand input from legal scholars concerning liability and regulatory frameworks, economists analyzing economic impact and job displacement, and ethicists grappling with moral dilemmas presented by AV decision-making.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch on the crucial human factors element, considering user acceptance, driver training adaptation, and the potential for new forms of human-machine interaction.  By emphasizing this interconnectedness, we aim to underscore the holistic nature of the AV challenge and the collaborative effort needed for its successful implementation.
