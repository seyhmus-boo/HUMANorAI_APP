Cloud computing, representing a paradigm shift in computing infrastructure, has evolved from its nascent stages in the late 20th century to its current ubiquitous presence.  Early forms, like time-sharing systems of the 1960s and 1970s, laid the groundwork by providing centralized computing resources accessed remotely.  However, the true precursor to modern cloud computing emerged with the development of the Internet and the rise of application service providers (ASPs) in the 1990s.  These services, offering software applications over the network, foreshadowed the Software as a Service (SaaS) model that dominates today.  The pivotal moment arrived with the early 2000s, marked by the emergence of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006, which popularized Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS), thereby solidifying the three main pillars of cloud computing.  Subsequent years witnessed rapid technological advancements, including virtualization, containerization, and serverless computing, significantly enhancing scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. This continuous evolution continues to reshape industries, fostering innovation and driving the development of new services and business models.  The ongoing trend toward edge computing and serverless architectures suggests a future where cloud services will become even more distributed and responsive to real-time demands.
