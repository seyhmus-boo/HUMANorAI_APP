This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in researching the Internet of Things (IoT) within the context of smart homes. While the potential benefits of interconnected home appliances are substantial, rigorous empirical investigation faces several significant hurdles.  Firstly, the heterogeneity of IoT devices, operating systems, and communication protocols presents a major obstacle to creating standardized and replicable experimental setups.  Secondly, ensuring robust data collection and analysis across diverse devices, encompassing both structured (e.g., sensor readings) and unstructured (e.g., user interactions) data streams, requires sophisticated methodologies and substantial computational resources.  Thirdly, ethical considerations, including data privacy and security, necessitate careful experimental design and participant consent procedures, potentially impacting the scope and feasibility of certain research questions.  Finally, the inherent complexity of smart home environments, encompassing various interconnected systems and user behaviours, makes it challenging to isolate the impact of specific IoT interventions.  This presentation will discuss these challenges through the lens of specific experimental design choices, highlighting best practices and potential solutions to advance robust and ethical research in this rapidly evolving field.
