Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet, has undergone a significant evolution since its conceptual origins.  Early forms, predating the term "cloud," can be traced back to time-sharing systems of the 1960s and 1970s, which offered centralized computing resources accessed remotely.  The emergence of the internet in the 1990s provided the crucial infrastructure for broader accessibility, leading to the development of application service providers (ASPs) offering software as a service (SaaS).  The late 1990s and early 2000s saw the rise of companies like Salesforce, pioneering the SaaS model and demonstrating the potential for scalable, on-demand applications.  However, the true acceleration of cloud computing came with the popularization of virtualization and the adoption of utility computing models, enabling the efficient allocation of resources and a pay-as-you-go pricing structure.  This period witnessed the emergence of major cloud providers like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure, solidifying the cloud computing landscape as we know it today.  The ongoing evolution encompasses advancements in areas such as serverless computing, artificial intelligence (AI) integration, and edge computing, constantly pushing the boundaries of scalability, efficiency, and accessibility.
