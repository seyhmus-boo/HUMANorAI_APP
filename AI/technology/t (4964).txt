The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological leap, yet its underlying physics often remain implicit. This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and AV development, arguing that a deeper understanding of quantum phenomena offers potential avenues for enhanced performance and safety. While classical computation underpins current AV systems, limitations in processing power and robustness necessitate exploration of alternative paradigms.  We will examine the potential of quantum computing for optimizing path planning algorithms, particularly in complex, dynamic environments where classical methods struggle with computational complexity.  Further, we will discuss the application of quantum sensors, such as atom interferometers and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), to enhance the accuracy and reliability of AV perception systems, surpassing the limitations of current LiDAR and radar technologies in challenging weather conditions. Finally, we will briefly consider the implications of quantum entanglement for secure inter-vehicle communication, crucial for collaborative driving and the prevention of accidents. This presentation aims to stimulate discussion on the unexplored potential of quantum mechanics in shaping the future of autonomous driving, moving beyond current limitations and paving the way for truly robust and efficient AV systems.
