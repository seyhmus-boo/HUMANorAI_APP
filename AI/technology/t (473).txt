The burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are rapidly transforming human interaction with the digital world, yet their underlying computational architectures largely remain confined to classical information processing. This research paper explores the potential for a paradigm shift, investigating the intersection of quantum mechanics and AR/VR applications.  While current AR/VR systems rely on classical algorithms for rendering and interaction, the inherent limitations of classical computing, particularly in managing complex simulations and processing vast datasets, necessitate exploration of alternative approaches. Quantum computing, with its capacity for superposition and entanglement, offers the prospect of significantly enhanced performance in several key areas.  We examine the potential benefits of quantum algorithms for real-time rendering of high-fidelity virtual environments, improved user interface design through quantum machine learning for personalized experiences, and the development of more realistic and immersive interactions. Specifically, we focus on the application of quantum algorithms in areas such as collision detection, pathfinding, and object recognition, exploring their potential to overcome the computational bottlenecks currently limiting AR/VR technology.  This study proposes a theoretical framework for integrating quantum computation into AR/VR systems, considering both the opportunities and the considerable challenges posed by current technological limitations.
