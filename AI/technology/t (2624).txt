Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the experimental challenges inherent in researching Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). While AI aims to create systems exhibiting human-like intelligence, ML focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Experimentation in this field presents several hurdles. Firstly, data bias significantly impacts model performance.  Biased datasets lead to algorithms perpetuating and amplifying existing societal inequalities, necessitating rigorous data cleaning and pre-processing techniques.

Secondly, evaluating model performance remains a complex task.  Standard metrics may not fully capture nuanced aspects of intelligence or learning, leading to potentially misleading conclusions.  Furthermore, the "black box" nature of many advanced ML models hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes and identify sources of error. Finally, resource constraints, including computational power and data availability, significantly limit the scope and scale of experiments, particularly in domains requiring large, complex datasets.  Addressing these challenges is critical for advancing the field responsibly and effectively.
