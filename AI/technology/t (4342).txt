Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly advancing, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations across computer science, psychology, engineering, and design.  This abstract explores the burgeoning applications stemming from these converging fields.  Computer science underpins the technological infrastructure, developing advanced algorithms for rendering, tracking, and interaction.  Engineering contributes to hardware development, miniaturization, and the creation of immersive haptic feedback systems.  Crucially, psychology plays a vital role in understanding user experience, cognitive load, and the impact of immersion on human perception and behavior.  Design principles, encompassing user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design, are critical for creating intuitive and engaging AR/VR applications.  The interdisciplinary nature of AR/VR development is evident in diverse applications, ranging from medical training simulations (integrating anatomy knowledge with interactive 3D models) and architectural visualization (combining design concepts with immersive walkthroughs) to therapeutic interventions (leveraging VR for exposure therapy) and educational tools (creating engaging learning experiences through interactive visualizations).  Future research must address challenges in accessibility, ethical implications, and the development of robust, cross-platform frameworks to fully realize the transformative potential of AR/VR across numerous domains.
