The proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological and societal shift, driven by converging advancements in artificial intelligence, sensor technology, and computing power.  Early research focused on limited autonomy systems, such as adaptive cruise control and lane-keeping assist, gradually paving the way for more sophisticated driver-assistance systems and, ultimately, fully autonomous capabilities.  This rise is fueled by the promise of enhanced road safety, reduced traffic congestion, and increased accessibility for individuals with limited mobility.  However, the deployment of AVs is not without challenges.  Technical hurdles remain, including robust perception in adverse weather conditions, ethical decision-making algorithms in unavoidable accident scenarios, and the development of reliable cybersecurity protocols.  Furthermore, regulatory frameworks are still evolving, grappling with issues of liability, insurance, and data privacy.  The economic implications are substantial, potentially disrupting established industries while creating new opportunities in software development, data analytics, and infrastructure management.  Future research should prioritize the mitigation of these challenges to ensure the safe, ethical, and equitable integration of AVs into transportation systems globally.
