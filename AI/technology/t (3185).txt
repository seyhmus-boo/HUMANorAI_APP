Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the evolution of cloud computing.  Initially, imagine computing resources as a single, powerful, but expensive mainframe – a private, on-site power plant.  This represents the pre-cloud era, where organizations owned and managed all their IT infrastructure.  The advent of virtualization, akin to subdividing that power plant into smaller, independent generators, enabled resource sharing. This marked the beginning of the cloud's journey.

The next phase, often described as "cloud 1.0", saw the emergence of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), like renting individual generators rather than owning the entire plant.  Platform as a Service (PaaS), or "cloud 2.0," followed, offering pre-built frameworks – think of this as renting a fully equipped workshop, rather than just the generators.  Finally, Software as a Service (SaaS) – "cloud 3.0" – represents the ultimate convenience; accessing ready-made products, analogous to using the workshop's finished products, without managing any underlying infrastructure.  This continuous evolution, from owning the entire plant to simply using its services, is the hallmark of cloud computing's transformative impact.
