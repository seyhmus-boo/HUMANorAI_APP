The burgeoning field of quantum computing presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant cybersecurity challenges.  This review examines the vulnerabilities and proposed solutions from a quantum mechanical perspective.  The primary threat stems from Shor's algorithm, which can efficiently factor large numbers and break widely used public-key cryptosystems like RSA and ECC, rendering current digital infrastructure vulnerable.  This necessitates the development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), exploring alternative mathematical structures resistant to quantum attacks, such as lattice-based, code-based, and multivariate cryptography.  

However, the solutions are not without their own challenges.  PQC algorithms are often computationally more intensive than their classical counterparts, impacting performance and resource requirements.  Furthermore, the transition to PQC necessitates significant infrastructure upgrades and widespread adoption, posing logistical and economic hurdles.  The review also touches upon quantum key distribution (QKD), offering theoretically unbreakable encryption based on quantum mechanics principles.  While promising, QKD faces limitations in scalability and practical implementation, particularly concerning distance and security against side-channel attacks.  Further research into robust QKD protocols and hybrid approaches combining PQC and QKD is crucial to effectively mitigate the impending quantum threat to cybersecurity.
