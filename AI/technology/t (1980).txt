The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) algorithms has revolutionized numerous fields, yet their underlying computational frameworks remain largely rooted in classical computation.  This paper explores the burgeoning intersection of quantum mechanics and AI/ML, arguing that quantum-enhanced approaches offer a potential paradigm shift in computational power and efficiency.  While classical algorithms struggle with certain computationally intractable problems, the unique properties of quantum systems—superposition, entanglement, and quantum interference—promise significant advantages in tackling complex tasks currently beyond the reach of even the most powerful classical computers.  We will examine the theoretical underpinnings of quantum machine learning (QML), focusing on key quantum algorithms such as quantum annealing, quantum adiabatic computation, and variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) methods, and discuss their potential applications in diverse areas including drug discovery, materials science, and financial modeling.  Further, we will critically analyze the current limitations and challenges facing the field, including the need for robust quantum hardware and the development of efficient quantum algorithms tailored to specific AI/ML problems.  This investigation aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the transformative potential of quantum mechanics in shaping the future of AI and ML.
