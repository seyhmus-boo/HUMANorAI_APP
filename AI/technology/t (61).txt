Big data's transformative impact on modern industries is undeniable, driving innovation across sectors ranging from finance and healthcare to manufacturing and retail.  However, harnessing the potential of these vast datasets presents significant experimental challenges that hinder the full realization of their value. This paper investigates the key experimental hurdles encountered in leveraging big data within various industrial contexts.  We examine the challenges inherent in data acquisition, focusing on the difficulties of obtaining representative, unbiased, and high-quality datasets often characterized by incompleteness, inconsistencies, and noise.  Further, we address the computational complexities involved in processing and analyzing these massive datasets, highlighting limitations in existing algorithms and infrastructure, especially concerning real-time processing and scalability.  The crucial issue of data privacy and security, encompassing ethical considerations and compliance with relevant regulations, is also explored.  Finally, the paper investigates the methodological challenges of establishing causality and generalizability from big data analyses, crucial for ensuring the reliable implementation of data-driven insights in real-world industrial applications.  By examining these experimental limitations, this research aims to contribute to the development of more robust and reliable methodologies for utilizing big data in industrial settings.
