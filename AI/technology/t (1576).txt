Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on blockchain technology and its diverse applications.  Imagine a digital ledger, replicated across numerous computers globally. This is the essence of a blockchain.  Each transaction, akin to a page in this ledger, is cryptographically secured and linked to the previous one, forming an immutable chain.  This inherent security, unlike a centralised database vulnerable to single points of failure, prevents tampering.

Think of it as a highly secure, transparent, and publicly verifiable spreadsheet.  This fundamental characteristic underpins various applications. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin leverage blockchains for secure and transparent transactions, eliminating intermediaries.  Supply chain management benefits from enhanced traceability, allowing businesses to track products from origin to consumer, enhancing accountability.  Furthermore, digital identity management can utilize blockchains to secure and verify personal data, reducing the risk of fraud and identity theft.  These are but a few examples illustrating the transformative potential of this disruptive technology.  We will delve deeper into these specific applications in subsequent lectures.
