Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent rapidly evolving technological domains with diverse applications across numerous sectors.  This presentation explores the key distinctions and overlapping functionalities of these technologies. AR overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  Applications range from interactive gaming and retail experiences to sophisticated medical training simulations and industrial maintenance procedures.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely computer-generated environments, typically through head-mounted displays.  Its applications are equally broad, encompassing therapeutic interventions for phobias, architectural visualization, and immersive educational experiences.  While distinct, both AR and VR are increasingly integrated, creating mixed reality experiences that blend physical and digital environments.  This convergence promises further expansion of application possibilities across entertainment, education, healthcare, and numerous other fields, necessitating ongoing research into user experience, technological limitations, and ethical considerations.
