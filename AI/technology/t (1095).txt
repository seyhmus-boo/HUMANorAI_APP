Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has rapidly evolved from its nascent stages to become a cornerstone of modern digital infrastructure.  This research paper examines the historical trajectory of cloud computing, tracing its origins and charting its significant transformations.  Early forms of resource sharing, exemplified by time-sharing systems and mainframe computing in the mid-20th century, laid the conceptual groundwork for distributed computing models.  The emergence of the internet in the 1990s provided the crucial network infrastructure necessary for the development of scalable and accessible computing resources.  The late 1990s and early 2000s witnessed the rise of key technologies like virtualization and service-oriented architecture, paving the way for the commercialization of cloud services.  This paper will explore the evolution of different cloud service models – Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) – analyzing their individual development and interdependencies.  Furthermore, it will address significant technological advancements, such as serverless computing and edge computing, and their impact on the continued evolution of this dynamic field.  Finally, the paper will consider future trends and potential challenges facing the ongoing development of cloud computing.
