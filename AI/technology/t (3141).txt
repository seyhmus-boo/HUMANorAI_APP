This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), highlighting their growing impact across diverse sectors.  We begin by differentiating AI, the broader concept of machines mimicking human intelligence, from ML, a subset focusing on algorithms that learn from data without explicit programming.  The presentation will then explore key ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, emphasizing their practical implications.

Specific applications will be examined, showcasing the transformative power of AI/ML.  Examples include advancements in medical diagnosis through image analysis and predictive modelling, personalized education via adaptive learning platforms, and optimized resource allocation in logistics and supply chain management.  Furthermore, we will briefly discuss the ethical considerations surrounding AI deployment, particularly concerning bias in algorithms and data privacy.  The presentation concludes with a look towards future trends, including the potential for explainable AI and the continued integration of AI/ML into everyday life.  The aim is to provide a balanced perspective on the opportunities and challenges presented by this rapidly evolving field.
