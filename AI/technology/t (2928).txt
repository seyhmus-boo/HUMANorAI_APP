While 5G networks themselves don't directly leverage quantum mechanics in their operational principles, their impact on technology indirectly fosters environments where quantum phenomena become increasingly relevant.  The significantly increased data rates and reduced latency offered by 5G facilitate the development and deployment of quantum technologies.  For instance, the immense bandwidth is crucial for transmitting the vast amounts of data generated by quantum computing simulations and experiments, accelerating progress in areas like quantum algorithm development and materials science.  

Furthermore, the enhanced connectivity enables the creation of distributed quantum networks, connecting geographically separated quantum processors and sensors via quantum entanglement or other quantum communication protocols.  This interconnection is essential for building large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers, a feat currently hampered by the inherent fragility of quantum states.  Ultimately, 5G's influence on the technological landscape creates an infrastructure supportive of the transition from theoretical quantum mechanics to practical quantum technologies, albeit without direct quantum mechanical principles governing its own operation.
