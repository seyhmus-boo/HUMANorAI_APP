The burgeoning field of quantum computing presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant cybersecurity challenges.  This review examines these dual aspects, focusing on the threat posed by quantum algorithms capable of breaking widely used public-key cryptosystems like RSA and ECC.  Solutions are critically assessed, primarily centered on the development of quantum-resistant cryptography (QRC).  Post-quantum cryptography algorithms, such as lattice-based, code-based, and multivariate cryptography, offer promising alternatives, although their performance and implementation complexities require further investigation.  The review highlights the need for a multi-faceted approach, encompassing not only algorithmic innovation but also hardware-level security enhancements to prevent side-channel attacks potentially exploiting quantum phenomena.  Further research is needed to establish rigorous security proofs for QRC algorithms and to assess their long-term resilience against future quantum attacks, possibly leveraging techniques from quantum key distribution (QKD) for enhanced security.  The transition to a post-quantum cryptographic landscape necessitates proactive planning and international collaboration to mitigate the potential risks associated with the quantum computing era.
