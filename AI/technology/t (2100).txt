The future of quantum computing hinges on overcoming significant experimental challenges. While theoretical advancements continue apace, realizing fault-tolerant quantum computers remains a formidable task. This presentation will explore key experimental hurdles hindering progress towards scalable, robust quantum computation.  We will focus on three primary areas:  (1) qubit coherence: extending coherence times to surpass error thresholds requires innovative qubit designs and advanced control techniques, tackling decoherence from environmental noise and crosstalk.  (2) qubit scalability:  scaling up the number of qubits while maintaining high fidelity presents a major engineering challenge, demanding new fabrication techniques and architectures to minimize cross-talk and ensure uniform qubit properties. (3) quantum error correction: implementing robust quantum error correction codes requires substantial overhead, posing a significant challenge to both scalability and coherence.  We will discuss recent advances in addressing these challenges, including novel qubit modalities, improved control methodologies, and the development of efficient error correction protocols.  Finally, we will outline promising research directions and their potential impact on achieving fault-tolerant quantum computation in the near future.
