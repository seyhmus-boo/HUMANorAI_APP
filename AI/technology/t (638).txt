The advent of quantum computing presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges to the landscape of cybersecurity.  While classical cryptographic systems underpinning much of modern digital security are vulnerable to attacks leveraging quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm, the inherent principles of quantum mechanics also offer the potential for novel and more robust security solutions. This research paper explores the multifaceted implications of this quantum revolution on cybersecurity, examining the vulnerabilities introduced by the looming threat of quantum-capable adversaries and the nascent development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC). We delve into specific challenges posed by quantum computing, such as the potential for breaking widely used public-key cryptosystems and the implications for data integrity and confidentiality.  Furthermore, the paper investigates the potential of quantum key distribution (QKD) and other quantum-based cryptographic techniques as viable solutions, analyzing their strengths, limitations, and practical feasibility.  Finally, we discuss the broader implications for infrastructure, policy, and standardization required to navigate this transformative technological shift and ensure the future resilience of cyberspace against quantum-enabled attacks.
