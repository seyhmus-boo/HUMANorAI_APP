Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on cloud computing and its evolutionary trajectory.  Initially, imagine computing as a single, powerful, on-site mainframe – a behemoth in a dedicated server room. This represents the pre-cloud era.  The evolution began with the shift towards client-server architecture: think of this as distributing the mainframe's power to numerous, less powerful desktops, a more manageable, albeit still locally confined, system.

The true dawn of cloud computing emerged with virtualization – imagine consolidating those numerous individual desktops into a single, powerful virtual machine, shared among many users. This allows for scalability and cost savings.  The next step involved the internet: this virtual machine, previously confined to a single location, is now hosted remotely, on servers belonging to a third-party provider. This is cloud computing in its simplest form – leveraging the internet to access remote computing resources.  The progression continues with innovations such as serverless computing, representing a further abstraction where the user focuses solely on code execution, leaving infrastructure management entirely to the provider. Thus, cloud computing has evolved from monolithic systems to highly flexible, distributed, and scalable environments.
