This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, examining their diverse functionalities and impact across various sectors.  We will illustrate the core differences between these technologies using familiar analogies.  Consider a photograph: AR overlays digital information onto the real-world scene captured in the photograph, like adding digitally rendered furniture to a picture of an empty room. In contrast, VR creates an entirely synthesized environment, akin to stepping into a completely computer-generated movie set.  

The presentation will delve into the practical applications of both technologies.  AR, for instance, finds utility in areas like medical training (superimposing anatomical models onto a patient's body),  industrial maintenance (providing step-by-step instructions overlaid on machinery), and interactive marketing (creating engaging product demonstrations).  VR, on the other hand, excels in immersive experiences such as architectural walkthroughs (experiencing a building design before construction), flight simulation (training pilots in realistic scenarios), and therapeutic interventions (treating phobias through controlled virtual environments).  Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss the challenges and ethical considerations surrounding the widespread adoption of AR and VR, focusing on user experience, accessibility, and data privacy.
