The Internet of Things (IoT), encompassing the network of interconnected physical objects embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies, has profoundly impacted various sectors, notably domestic environments.  While early examples of networked home appliances existed in the late 20th century, the advent of widespread broadband internet and miniaturization of computing power in the 21st century fuelled the explosion of smart home technology.  Essentially, smart homes leverage IoT by connecting devices like lighting, thermostats, security systems, and appliances to a central network, often controlled via a smartphone application. This interconnectivity facilitates automation, remote monitoring, and enhanced energy efficiency.  However, the widespread adoption of IoT in homes raises significant concerns regarding data privacy, security vulnerabilities, and the potential for technological dependence.  Further research is crucial to mitigate these challenges and unlock the full potential of smart home technologies while addressing their inherent risks.  The ongoing evolution of IoT promises further integration and sophistication within domestic settings.
