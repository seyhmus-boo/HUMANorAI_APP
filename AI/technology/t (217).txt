Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent transformative technologies with diverse applications across numerous sectors.  This lecture explores the core distinctions and overlapping functionalities of AR and VR, emphasizing their practical implementations. AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception, as exemplified by applications in navigation, gaming, and medical training through real-time anatomical overlays.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, offering highly interactive experiences with applications in architectural visualization, therapeutic interventions for phobias, and immersive gaming.  The lecture further examines the convergence of these technologies,  highlighting examples such as mixed reality (MR) systems that seamlessly blend real and virtual worlds.  Key considerations regarding technological limitations, ethical implications, and the future trajectory of AR/VR development, including advancements in haptic feedback and artificial intelligence integration, are also addressed.  Ultimately, the lecture posits that AR and VR are poised to revolutionize human-computer interaction and profoundly impact various aspects of society.
