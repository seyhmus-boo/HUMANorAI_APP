Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has rapidly evolved from its nascent stages to become a ubiquitous force shaping diverse sectors. This research paper explores the multifaceted evolution of cloud computing, emphasizing its inherently interdisciplinary nature.  While initially rooted in computer science and networking, its growth has intricately interwoven with fields like economics, law, sociology, and environmental science. The initial focus on distributed computing and virtualization has broadened to encompass sophisticated service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), fostering innovation across various domains.  The paper will examine this evolution through a lens of technological advancements, analyzing the transition from grid computing and early virtualized servers to the current landscape dominated by hyperscale data centers and serverless architectures.  Furthermore, it will investigate the concomitant societal, economic, and environmental impacts, acknowledging the complex interplay between technological development, regulatory frameworks, and societal adaptation.  By examining these interdisciplinary connections, the paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of cloud computing's trajectory and its profound influence on the contemporary world.
