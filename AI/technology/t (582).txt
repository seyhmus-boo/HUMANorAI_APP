This presentation charts the evolution of cloud computing from its nascent stages to its current ubiquitous presence.  We begin by examining the foundational technologies and early architectures that paved the way for cloud adoption, highlighting the shift from centralized mainframes to distributed, networked systems.  The presentation then explores the key architectural models that have defined the landscape: Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), emphasizing their respective strengths and limitations.  We will analyze the significant role of virtualization and containerization technologies in enabling scalability and efficiency within these models.

Furthermore, we will delve into the practical applications driving cloud adoption across diverse sectors. Examples will include the use of IaaS for scalable data storage and processing in scientific research, PaaS for rapid application development in the startup ecosystem, and SaaS for enhancing productivity and collaboration in business environments.  Finally, we will briefly address emerging trends, such as edge computing and serverless architectures, and their potential impact on the future development of cloud computing.  The presentation concludes with a discussion of the ongoing challenges and future prospects of this transformative technology.
