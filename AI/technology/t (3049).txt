The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological and societal shift. This review examines the accelerating development and deployment of AVs, highlighting key technological advancements in sensor fusion, machine learning, and high-definition mapping.  While significant progress has been made in controlled environments, challenges persist in navigating complex and unpredictable real-world scenarios, including adverse weather conditions and unexpected human behaviour.  Ethical considerations surrounding accident liability, job displacement, and data privacy remain central concerns, demanding robust regulatory frameworks.  This review further analyzes the evolving economic landscape, encompassing the potential for increased efficiency in logistics and transportation while acknowledging the considerable investment required for infrastructure adaptation and technological refinement.  Despite ongoing challenges, the trajectory suggests a continued, albeit gradual, integration of AVs into various sectors, demanding interdisciplinary collaboration to address the multifaceted technological, ethical, and societal implications.  Future research should focus on enhancing robustness, safety verification methodologies, and the development of equitable societal frameworks to manage the transition to a more autonomous transportation system.
