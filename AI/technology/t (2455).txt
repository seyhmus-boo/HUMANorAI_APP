This presentation addresses the experimental challenges inherent in developing and validating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) systems.  While AI/ML offers transformative potential across numerous domains, rigorous experimental design and evaluation remain crucial yet often underdeveloped. We will examine key challenges, including data bias and its impact on model fairness and generalizability.  The difficulties in defining appropriate ground truth and establishing robust evaluation metrics will be discussed, particularly in complex, real-world applications lacking clear success criteria.  Furthermore, the reproducibility crisis in AI/ML research, stemming from inadequate documentation of experimental setups and data preprocessing steps, will be highlighted.  We will argue that addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach, encompassing the development of standardized benchmarking datasets, the adoption of more transparent and reproducible research practices, and the rigorous evaluation of models across diverse contexts.  Finally, we will propose potential solutions and future research directions to foster greater methodological rigor and enhance the reliability of AI/ML systems.
