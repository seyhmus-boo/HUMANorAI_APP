The burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are not solely the domain of computer science; their successful implementation and widespread adoption necessitate a deeply interdisciplinary approach.  Computer scientists, of course, provide the foundational technological infrastructure, developing algorithms for 3D rendering, spatial tracking, and user interface design. However, effective AR/VR applications require significant contributions from human-computer interaction (HCI) specialists, who focus on usability, accessibility, and user experience.  Furthermore,  cognitive psychologists play a crucial role in understanding the perceptual and cognitive effects of immersion, informing design choices to minimize cybersickness and maximize engagement.  Industrial design principles are vital in creating comfortable and intuitive hardware, while fields like graphic design and animation contribute to the aesthetic appeal and narrative impact of the virtual environments.  Finally, the ethical implications of these technologies, including concerns surrounding privacy, data security, and potential societal biases embedded in algorithms, demand input from ethicists and social scientists. This collaborative effort across multiple disciplines is crucial for realizing the full potential of AR and VR across diverse sectors, from healthcare and education to entertainment and manufacturing.
