Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs).  The rise of AVs is driven by significant advancements in several key areas: sensor technology (LiDAR, radar, cameras), artificial intelligence, particularly machine learning for perception and decision-making, and high-precision mapping.  These technological breakthroughs have enabled the development of vehicles capable of navigating complex environments with minimal human intervention.

The practical applications are numerous and far-reaching.  In logistics, autonomous trucks promise to revolutionize freight transport, increasing efficiency and reducing driver fatigue-related accidents.  Within urban environments, self-driving taxis and ride-sharing services offer potential solutions to traffic congestion and accessibility challenges for the elderly or disabled.  Furthermore, AVs are being explored for specialized applications such as agricultural machinery and automated delivery systems.  However, ethical and regulatory hurdles, including liability issues and cybersecurity concerns, remain significant obstacles to widespread AV adoption.  Further research and development are crucial to fully realize the transformative potential of this technology.
