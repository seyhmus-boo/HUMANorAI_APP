The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology presents significant experimental challenges hindering widespread deployment. This presentation explores key obstacles encountered during the testing and validation phases of AV development.  We will focus on three primary areas:  Firstly, the limitations of current sensor technologies in handling diverse and unpredictable real-world scenarios, including adverse weather conditions and complex traffic interactions, will be examined.  Secondly, the inherent difficulties in creating robust and verifiable software capable of managing the immense complexity of autonomous decision-making will be discussed, highlighting the challenges of ensuring safety and ethical considerations within complex algorithms.  Finally, the need for comprehensive and scalable testing methodologies, moving beyond simulated environments to encompass extensive real-world testing under diverse conditions, will be addressed.  The presentation will conclude by outlining critical research directions aimed at mitigating these experimental challenges and accelerating the safe and reliable integration of AVs into our transportation systems.  This includes a discussion on the ethical implications of large-scale data collection for training and validation purposes.
