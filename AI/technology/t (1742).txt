This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), tracing their historical development and highlighting their current significance.  Early conceptualizations of AI, dating back to the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, envisioned intelligent machines capable of mimicking human cognitive functions.  However, initial optimism was tempered by limitations in computing power and algorithmic sophistication, leading to periods of reduced funding and what is often referred to as "AI winters."

The resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributable to breakthroughs in ML, particularly deep learning. This presentation will explore key milestones, such as the development of backpropagation algorithms and the increasing availability of large datasets, enabling the training of complex neural networks.  We will examine the diverse applications of AI and ML across various fields, including natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.  Furthermore, we will briefly discuss the ethical considerations and societal implications arising from the rapid advancement of these technologies, emphasizing the need for responsible development and deployment.  The presentation will conclude by considering future directions and challenges in the ongoing evolution of AI and ML.
