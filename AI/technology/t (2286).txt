The advent of quantum computing presents both unprecedented challenges and opportunities for cybersecurity.  Existing cryptographic systems, reliant on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithm problems, are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers, posing a significant threat to data confidentiality and integrity.  This abstract explores the emergent field of post-quantum cryptography (PQC), examining candidate algorithms resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum adversaries.  Lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, and multivariate cryptography are highlighted as promising avenues, showcasing their mathematical foundations and relative strengths and weaknesses.  Further research is crucial in assessing the practical implementation of PQC algorithms, considering factors such as key size, computational overhead, and security against side-channel attacks.  Additionally, the development of quantum-resistant hardware and secure quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols are explored as complementary approaches, offering pathways towards establishing a robust and secure quantum-resistant cryptographic infrastructure.  This multifaceted approach is necessary to mitigate the risks posed by quantum computing and ensure the long-term security of digital information.
