This presentation explores the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart homes, examining their historical trajectory and current state.  Early examples of "smart home" technology, such as automated lighting systems in the mid-20th century, foreshadowed the interconnectedness enabled by the IoT.  However, the proliferation of affordable microcontrollers, pervasive wireless networking (Wi-Fi, Zigbee, Z-Wave), and cloud computing platforms in recent decades has fundamentally transformed the landscape.  This presentation will outline the key technological components underpinning modern smart homes, including sensor networks, actuators, and home automation hubs.  Furthermore, we will analyze the societal impact of this technology, addressing both its benefits – enhanced security, energy efficiency, and convenience – and its challenges – concerns surrounding data privacy, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and digital divide exacerbation.  The presentation concludes by considering future trends, such as the integration of artificial intelligence and the expansion of smart home functionalities to encompass broader aspects of daily life, ultimately contributing to a more connected and automated domestic environment.
