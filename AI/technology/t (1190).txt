Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct but related approaches to merging the physical and digital worlds.  AR can be likened to adding digital annotations to a pre-existing canvas â€“ imagine a surgeon overlaying a patient's internal anatomy onto their body during an operation, visualized via a headset.  The real-world context remains paramount; digital information enhances, rather than replaces it.  In contrast, VR is akin to constructing an entirely new, digital environment.  Think of a flight simulator: the pilot interacts with a completely simulated world, receiving feedback based on their actions within this wholly fabricated space. This virtual environment can closely mimic reality, or venture into the fantastical.  Both AR and VR applications leverage advancements in computer graphics, sensor technology, and human-computer interaction to create immersive experiences, with applications ranging from entertainment and training to healthcare and engineering.  Their differentiating factor lies in the degree to which they supplement or supersede the user's perception of reality.
