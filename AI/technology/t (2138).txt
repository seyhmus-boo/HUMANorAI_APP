This presentation examines the experimental challenges encountered in realizing the full potential of 5G networks and their transformative impact on technology. While 5G promises significant advancements in speed, latency, and connectivity, its deployment and effective utilization face substantial hurdles.  We will discuss key experimental challenges related to channel modelling and propagation prediction, particularly in dense urban environments and non-line-of-sight scenarios.  Accurate characterization of interference from existing networks and the impact of diverse device types presents a significant modelling challenge.  Furthermore, the experimental validation of key 5G features, such as network slicing and edge computing, requires sophisticated testbeds and robust methodologies to assess performance under realistic traffic conditions.  We will explore the difficulties in ensuring seamless handover between cells and managing the increased complexity of network orchestration. Finally, we will address the critical need for standardized and reproducible experimental procedures to facilitate meaningful comparison of results across different research groups and deployment scenarios, ultimately accelerating the development and optimization of 5G technology and its application in diverse sectors.
