Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined fields facing significant experimental challenges.  While AI encompasses the broader goal of creating intelligent agents, ML provides the core algorithmic mechanisms to achieve this. A key challenge lies in data limitations; robust ML models require extensive, high-quality, and representative datasets, which are often scarce, expensive to acquire, or suffer from biases reflecting societal inequalities.  This data scarcity hinders the generalizability of models, leading to poor performance on unseen data, a phenomenon known as overfitting or the generalization gap.

Furthermore, evaluating the performance of AI/ML systems presents a methodological hurdle. Traditional metrics, such as accuracy, often fail to capture nuanced aspects of performance, particularly in real-world applications with complex and uncertain environments.  Establishing causal relationships between model input and output, crucial for trustworthy AI, remains a significant challenge, as does explaining the decision-making processes of complex models (the "black box" problem), hindering interpretability and hindering trust in high-stakes applications.  Finally,  the ethical implications of AI/ML, such as algorithmic bias and potential misuse, pose considerable experimental and societal challenges requiring careful consideration in design and deployment.
