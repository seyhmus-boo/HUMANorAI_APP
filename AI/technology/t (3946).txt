Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the intersection of quantum mechanics and cybersecurity.  The advent of quantum computing presents significant challenges to current cryptographic systems.  Algorithms like Shor's algorithm pose a direct threat to widely used public-key cryptography, such as RSA, by efficiently factoring large numbers, rendering encryption vulnerable.  This necessitates a paradigm shift in cybersecurity strategies.

Solutions are being actively pursued, broadly categorized into quantum-resistant cryptography (QRC) and quantum key distribution (QKD).  QRC involves developing algorithms resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers, including lattice-based, code-based, and multivariate cryptography.  QKD, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, promises unconditionally secure key exchange by exploiting phenomena like quantum entanglement or single-photon transmission, detecting any eavesdropping attempts.  However, QKD implementation faces challenges related to scalability and distance limitations.  Further research is crucial to fully realise the potential of QRC and QKD and to ensure the future security of our digital infrastructure in the quantum era.
