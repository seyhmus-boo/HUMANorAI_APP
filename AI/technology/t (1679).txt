Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, while experiencing a recent surge in popularity, possess a history rooted in early computer graphics research.  Early conceptualizations, dating back to the mid-20th century, envisioned immersive environments through sensory simulation.  Ivan Sutherland's "The Ultimate Display" (1965) is considered a seminal work, outlining a vision of a fully immersive, computer-generated worldâ€”a foundational concept for modern VR.  The development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) in the 1980s and 1990s, though initially cumbersome and limited, further propelled the field.  In contrast, AR's emergence was more gradual, with early examples incorporating rudimentary overlays onto real-world scenes.  The convergence of improved computing power, sensor technologies (e.g., inertial measurement units, depth sensors), and miniaturization has fueled the recent explosion in AR/VR applications.  These applications now span diverse fields, including gaming, education, healthcare (surgical simulation, therapeutic interventions), engineering (design visualization, training), and manufacturing (remote maintenance, collaborative design).  Despite current limitations in areas such as processing power, latency, and user comfort, ongoing research continues to address these challenges, paving the way for even more impactful and widespread use of AR and VR technologies across various sectors.
