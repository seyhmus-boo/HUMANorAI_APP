Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) face significant experimental challenges despite rapid advancements.  A core issue lies in data limitations: ML models are data-hungry, requiring vast, high-quality, and representative datasets for effective training.  Acquiring and curating such datasets is often costly and time-consuming, particularly for specialized domains.  Moreover, biases present in training data inevitably propagate into model outputs, leading to unfair or discriminatory outcomes, posing ethical and practical hurdles.

Another challenge stems from model interpretability.  Many sophisticated ML models, particularly deep learning architectures, operate as "black boxes," making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes. This opacity hinders both debugging and the establishment of trust, particularly in high-stakes applications like healthcare and finance.  Finally, the evaluation of AI/ML systems presents a challenge.  Traditional metrics may not fully capture performance in complex real-world scenarios, necessitating the development of more nuanced and robust evaluation frameworks that account for diverse factors such as robustness to adversarial attacks and generalization to unseen data.
