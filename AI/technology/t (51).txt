Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the burgeoning fields of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) and their rapidly evolving applications.  While VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, AR overlays digital information onto the real world.  Recent developments demonstrate a significant shift towards convergence and increased sophistication.

In VR, advancements in haptic feedback technology are enhancing user interaction, creating more realistic and immersive experiences.  This is particularly evident in gaming and simulation training, where realistic physical sensations are crucial.  Conversely, AR applications are witnessing explosive growth, driven by the integration of computer vision and improved mobile processing power.  We see sophisticated AR applications in retail, allowing virtual try-ons, and in healthcare, facilitating complex surgical procedures through real-time overlay of anatomical data.

Furthermore, the development of lighter, more affordable headsets is democratising access to both technologies.  The convergence of AR and VR, leading to mixed reality (MR) experiences, represents a significant frontier, promising seamless integration of digital and physical spaces with immense potential across numerous sectors.  The future trajectory indicates increasingly sophisticated and pervasive deployment across diverse industries.
