Cloud computing, representing a paradigm shift in information technology, has evolved rapidly from its nascent stages in the late 20th century.  Initially characterized by simple network-attached storage and rudimentary remote computing capabilities, the field has witnessed significant advancements driven by increasing bandwidth, powerful virtualization technologies, and the proliferation of the internet. The transition from grid computing, focusing on high-performance parallel processing, to the more commercially oriented cloud services we see today involved the development of sophisticated infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), platform-as-a-service (PaaS), and software-as-a-service (SaaS) models.  These models enabled the provision of scalable and on-demand resources, including computing power, storage, and software applications, delivered over a network.  Practical applications are now ubiquitous, ranging from large-scale data analytics employed by research institutions and corporations to the everyday use of cloud-based email services, collaborative document editing platforms, and streaming media.  Furthermore, cloud computing has become integral to the Internet of Things (IoT), facilitating the processing and management of data from billions of connected devices.  The ongoing evolution continues, with a focus on enhancing security, improving efficiency, and exploring new paradigms like serverless computing and edge computing to address the challenges of ever-increasing data volumes and diverse application needs.
