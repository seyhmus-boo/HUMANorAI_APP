The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological leap, but its underlying physics often remains implicit. This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and AV development, focusing on areas where quantum phenomena could significantly impact future advancements.  While classical computation dominates current AV systems,  we posit that quantum-enhanced sensing and computation offer potential advantages.  Specifically, we examine the application of quantum metrology for improved LiDAR and radar systems, enabling enhanced object detection and range resolution in challenging environmental conditions.  Further, we discuss the potential of quantum computing for optimizing complex path planning algorithms, addressing the computationally intensive nature of real-time decision-making in dynamic environments. The inherent limitations of classical approaches in handling large datasets and complex scenarios necessitate the exploration of quantum annealing or quantum machine learning for accelerating training and enhancing robustness.  Finally, we briefly address the challenges associated with integrating quantum technologies into AV architectures, emphasizing the need for further research in quantum error correction and miniaturization.  This presentation aims to stimulate discussion about the potentially transformative role of quantum mechanics in shaping the future of autonomous driving.
