This presentation examines the evolving landscape of cybersecurity challenges and the innovative solutions emerging to address them.  Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have significantly impacted both the threat and defense sides.  While AI-powered attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and autonomous, leveraging techniques like deepfakes and advanced persistent threats, advancements in AI-driven security analytics offer enhanced threat detection and response capabilities.  Furthermore, the increasing reliance on cloud computing introduces novel vulnerabilities, demanding robust cloud security architectures and proactive threat management strategies.  The presentation will discuss the growing importance of zero-trust security models, which prioritize continuous verification and least privilege access, as a countermeasure to escalating threats.  Finally, we will explore the crucial role of human factors in cybersecurity, highlighting the need for improved cybersecurity awareness training and robust incident response planning to mitigate human error, a persistent vulnerability in even the most advanced systems. The presentation concludes by outlining future research directions focused on leveraging quantum computing for both offensive and defensive cybersecurity applications.
