This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, highlighting their significant interdisciplinary potential.  While individually transformative, the synergistic effects of AR and VR are amplified through collaboration across diverse fields.  We will examine key interdisciplinary linkages, including the contributions of computer science (in development of immersive interfaces and rendering techniques), human-computer interaction (focusing on user experience and usability), psychology (exploring the cognitive and emotional impacts of immersion), and design (in crafting intuitive and engaging user interfaces).  Furthermore, the presentation will showcase specific examples demonstrating the impact of this interdisciplinary approach across various sectors: healthcare (surgical training and rehabilitation), education (interactive learning environments), and engineering (design visualization and prototyping). By fostering collaboration between these fields, we can unlock the full potential of AR/VR technologies, leading to more effective, efficient, and user-centered applications. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of future research directions and the ethical considerations inherent in the widespread adoption of these technologies.
