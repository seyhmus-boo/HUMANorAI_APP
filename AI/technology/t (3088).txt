Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly evolving, transitioning from niche technologies to impactful tools across diverse sectors.  This review examines their practical applications, highlighting significant advancements and limitations.  AR, overlaying digital information onto the real world, finds utility in fields such as medicine, enabling surgeons to visualize internal anatomy during procedures, and in manufacturing, providing real-time guidance for complex assembly processes.  Similarly, AR enhances training simulations through interactive, immersive experiences, benefiting areas like aviation and military training.

VR, on the other hand, creates fully immersive digital environments.  Its applications range from therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD to architectural walkthroughs, allowing clients to virtually experience building designs before construction.  Moreover, VR is instrumental in remote collaboration, facilitating virtual meetings and shared workspaces, and in entertainment, delivering compelling gaming and interactive storytelling experiences.

Despite their potential, both technologies face challenges.  High initial costs, the need for specialized hardware, and the potential for motion sickness and cognitive overload hinder widespread adoption.  Further research is needed to address these limitations and unlock the full potential of AR and VR across a broader spectrum of applications.
