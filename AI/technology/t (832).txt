The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a paradigm shift in transportation comparable to the transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles.  This presentation examines the key technological advancements driving this revolution, drawing parallels to established fields.  Just as the development of the internal combustion engine unlocked the potential of the automobile, breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning and computer vision, are powering the capabilities of AVs.  Sensor fusion in AVs mirrors the integration of multiple instruments in a pilot's cockpit, providing a comprehensive understanding of the environment.  Path planning algorithms are akin to sophisticated navigational systems, charting optimal routes with unprecedented accuracy.  However, challenges remain.  The ethical dilemmas posed by AV decision-making during unavoidable accidents can be likened to the trolley problem, demanding careful philosophical and legal consideration.  Furthermore, the infrastructure required for widespread AV adoption mirrors the massive investment in road networks accompanying the rise of the automobile. This presentation will explore these parallels and contrasts, offering insights into the potential societal impacts and remaining hurdles in the journey towards fully autonomous transportation.
