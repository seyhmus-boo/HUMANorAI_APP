The advent of quantum computing presents both unprecedented challenges and potential solutions to cybersecurity.  Current cryptographic systems, reliant on the computational intractability of problems like integer factorization (RSA) and discrete logarithm (ECC), are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers.  Shor's algorithm, for instance, efficiently solves these problems, rendering widely used encryption methods obsolete. This poses a significant threat to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability across various sectors.

Addressing this necessitates a transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC).  Research focuses on algorithms believed to be resistant to both classical and quantum attacks, including lattice-based, code-based, multivariate, and hash-based cryptography.  These methods leverage the inherent mathematical hardness of problems deemed intractable even for quantum computers.  However,  implementation and standardization of PQC algorithms present considerable challenges, requiring careful consideration of performance, security parameters, and compatibility with existing infrastructure.  Furthermore, quantum key distribution (QKD), leveraging quantum mechanical principles like entanglement, offers a potentially secure method for key exchange, promising unconditional security against eavesdropping.  Nevertheless, QKD's practical deployment faces limitations concerning distance, infrastructure requirements, and susceptibility to side-channel attacks.  Ultimately, a multi-faceted approach integrating PQC algorithms and secure quantum communication protocols is crucial for mitigating the future quantum threat landscape.
