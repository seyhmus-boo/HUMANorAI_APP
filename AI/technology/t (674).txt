The Internet of Things (IoT) has rapidly transitioned from a nascent technological concept to a pervasive reality, significantly impacting various sectors, with the smart home emerging as a prominent application area. This research paper examines the intersection of IoT and smart homes, focusing on recent developments and their implications.  While early smart home systems were largely limited to basic automation features, recent advancements have broadened functionalities dramatically.  The proliferation of low-power wide-area networks (LPWANs), such as LoRaWAN and NB-IoT, has facilitated the seamless integration of numerous energy-efficient devices, enabling wider deployment and more granular control.  Furthermore, the rise of edge computing mitigates latency issues previously associated with cloud-based processing, facilitating real-time responsiveness in smart home applications.  Beyond individual devices, advancements in AI and machine learning are empowering sophisticated home automation systems capable of predictive maintenance, personalized energy management, and enhanced security protocols.  This paper will analyse these advancements, considering their potential benefits alongside emerging challenges related to data security, privacy, and interoperability.  Finally, future trends and research directions within the field will be explored.
