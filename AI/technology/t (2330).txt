Quantum computing, a paradigm shift in computational power leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, holds immense promise across diverse scientific and technological domains.  However, the transition from theoretical frameworks to practical, large-scale quantum computers faces significant experimental challenges.  This paper explores the critical hurdles hindering the realization of fault-tolerant, scalable quantum computers.  We delve into the persistent issues surrounding qubit coherence, focusing on the fragility of quantum states susceptible to decoherence from environmental noise and imperfections in fabrication.  Furthermore, we examine the difficulties associated with achieving high-fidelity quantum gates, crucial for executing complex quantum algorithms with minimal error accumulation.  The scaling problem, namely, increasing the number of qubits while maintaining coherence and control, poses a significant technological barrier.  Finally, we analyze the challenges in developing robust error correction codes capable of mitigating the detrimental effects of noise and gate errors in large-scale quantum systems.  Addressing these experimental limitations is paramount to unlocking the transformative potential of quantum computing.
