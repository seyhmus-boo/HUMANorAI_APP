This review examines the evolution of cloud computing, tracing its trajectory from nascent distributed computing concepts to the sophisticated, ubiquitous service model prevalent today.  Early iterations, characterized by grid computing and utility computing, laid the groundwork for the virtualization and service-oriented architectures that underpin modern cloud deployments.  The emergence of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) models marked a significant shift, enabling scalable and cost-effective IT resource provisioning.  This evolution has been driven by advancements in virtualization technologies, high-speed networking, and data center automation.  The paper further explores the impact of key technological innovations such as containerization and serverless computing on cloud architecture and functionality.  While offering significant advantages in terms of flexibility, scalability, and cost efficiency, challenges remain, including security concerns, vendor lock-in, and the complexities of data governance and compliance.  Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring the potential of emerging technologies like edge computing and quantum computing to further enhance cloud capabilities and applications.
