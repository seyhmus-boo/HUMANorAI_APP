Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct but related technological advancements impacting numerous sectors. AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones or smart glasses.  This enables applications like interactive product visualization in e-commerce, allowing customers to virtually place furniture in their homes before purchase.  In healthcare, AR assists surgeons with real-time anatomical data projection during procedures, improving precision.  Furthermore, AR-based training simulations provide immersive learning experiences in fields like aviation and manufacturing.

VR, conversely, creates entirely immersive, simulated environments. Users are fully immersed in a computer-generated world through headsets, interacting with the virtual space using controllers or body tracking.  This technology finds extensive use in gaming, offering realistic and engaging gameplay.  Beyond entertainment, VR facilitates therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD through exposure therapy.  Furthermore,  architectural visualization and engineering design benefit from VR's ability to create walk-through models, enabling early identification of design flaws and collaborative planning.  The convergence of AR and VR technologies promises even more sophisticated applications in the future.
