The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has significantly impacted the residential sector, leading to the emergence of smart homes. This integration involves connecting various household appliances and systems – including lighting, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC), security systems, and entertainment devices – to a central network, often facilitated by a home automation hub.  Data generated by these interconnected devices allows for remote monitoring and control, enhancing user convenience and energy efficiency.  However, the pervasive deployment of IoT in smart homes also raises critical concerns.  Security vulnerabilities represent a significant challenge, with potential for unauthorized access and data breaches.  Furthermore, the reliance on continuous network connectivity introduces points of failure, potentially disrupting functionality.  Privacy implications related to the collection and use of personal data generated by smart home devices are also increasingly scrutinized.  Future research should focus on developing robust security protocols, enhancing energy-efficient architectures, and addressing user privacy concerns to realize the full potential of IoT in a safe and ethically responsible manner within the smart home paradigm.
