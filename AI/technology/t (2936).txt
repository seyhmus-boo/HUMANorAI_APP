Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related approaches to manipulating human perception.  AR, analogous to adding digital annotations to a physical map, overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real world, enhancing it rather than replacing it.  Think of a heads-up display in a fighter jet, providing crucial flight information directly within the pilot's visual field â€“ the real world is augmented with relevant data.  Conversely, VR, akin to immersing oneself in a meticulously crafted diorama, constructs entirely synthetic environments that replace the user's real-world perception.  This complete sensory immersion, achieved through headsets and haptic feedback, simulates presence in a virtual space, as with exploring a historical site recreated digitally.  Both AR and VR leverage technological advancements in computer graphics, sensory input, and interactive interfaces to create compelling and potentially transformative applications, ranging from interactive training simulations to immersive gaming experiences and innovative medical treatments. Their differential lies in their relationship with the physical environment: AR augments it, while VR substitutes it.
