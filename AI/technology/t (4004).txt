Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture will briefly explore the interconnected fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception and decision-making.  Machine Learning, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on the input data they are trained on.

This distinction is crucial: AI sets the overarching goal of intelligent systems, while ML provides a powerful mechanism to achieve it.  Practical applications are ubiquitous.  ML algorithms power recommendation systems on e-commerce platforms, enabling personalized product suggestions.  In healthcare, they assist in disease diagnosis through image analysis and predictive modeling.  Furthermore, self-driving cars leverage ML for object recognition and navigation, and financial institutions employ ML for fraud detection and risk assessment.  The synergy between AI and ML continues to drive innovation across diverse sectors, promising transformative advancements in the years to come.
