This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), tracing their historical development and highlighting current applications.  Early conceptualizations of AI, dating back to the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, envisioned machines capable of human-level intelligence.  Initial successes in areas like game playing and theorem proving were followed by periods of reduced funding and progress, known as "AI winters."  However, the resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributable to advancements in computing power and the availability of massive datasets.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on algorithms that enable computers to learn from data without explicit programming. This presentation will explore key ML paradigms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, illustrating their distinct methodologies and applications. We will examine the impact of deep learning, characterized by artificial neural networks with multiple layers, which has driven significant breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and other domains.  Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss the ethical considerations and societal implications associated with increasingly sophisticated AI and ML systems, emphasizing the need for responsible development and deployment.
