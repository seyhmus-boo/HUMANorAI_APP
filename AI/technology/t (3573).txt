Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly transitioning from niche applications to pervasive tools impacting diverse sectors. This research paper explores the burgeoning field of AR/VR applications, emphasizing the crucial interdisciplinary collaborations driving innovation and adoption.  While individually powerful, the synergistic potential of AR and VR is amplified through the integration of expertise from seemingly disparate fields.  Computer science provides the foundational technological framework, encompassing areas such as 3D modelling, real-time rendering, and human-computer interaction.  However, successful implementation necessitates contributions from psychology, addressing issues of user experience, immersion, and cognitive load.  Design thinking, encompassing user-centred design principles and interface development, is crucial for creating intuitive and effective systems.  Furthermore, the integration of AR/VR into established domains like medicine, education, and engineering requires deep collaboration with specialists in these respective fields, leading to tailored applications that directly address specific challenges. This paper will analyze the key interdisciplinary connections fostering AR/VR advancements, examining both successful collaborations and identifying areas requiring further interdisciplinary engagement to fully realize the transformative potential of these technologies.
