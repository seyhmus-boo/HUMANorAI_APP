Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and language translation.  Machine learning, a subfield of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms that allow computer systems to learn from and make predictions based on data without explicit programming.  This learning process often involves identifying patterns and relationships within large datasets, enabling the system to improve its performance over time.  Practical applications of AI and ML are ubiquitous and rapidly expanding.  In healthcare, ML algorithms analyze medical images for disease detection and personalize treatment plans.  Finance leverages AI for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment.  The transportation sector utilizes AI in self-driving cars and optimized traffic management systems.  Furthermore, AI powers recommendation systems in e-commerce, enhances customer service through chatbots, and facilitates natural language processing in various applications, including language translation and sentiment analysis. The continuous development and refinement of AI and ML algorithms promise to further revolutionize numerous industries and aspects of daily life.
