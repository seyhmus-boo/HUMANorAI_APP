The future of quantum computing hinges on overcoming significant experimental challenges.  While theoretical advancements have outlined powerful algorithms for quantum computers, the physical realization of fault-tolerant, scalable systems remains elusive.  Major hurdles include maintaining quantum coherence, the delicate superposition and entanglement crucial for computation, against decoherence induced by environmental noise.  This necessitates improved qubit fabrication techniques, exploring novel materials and architectures beyond superconducting and trapped-ion systems,  and developing sophisticated quantum error correction codes capable of mitigating noise at scale.

Furthermore, scaling up the number of qubits while preserving connectivity and minimizing crosstalk poses a substantial engineering challenge.  Existing architectures face limitations in qubit scalability and controllability, necessitating innovative approaches such as topological quantum computing or photonic platforms.  Finally, the development of efficient and reliable quantum control and measurement techniques is critical. Precise qubit manipulation and error-free readout remain bottlenecks, requiring advanced control electronics and cryogenic infrastructure for maintaining extremely low temperatures.  Overcoming these experimental obstacles will determine the timeline and eventual impact of quantum computing.
