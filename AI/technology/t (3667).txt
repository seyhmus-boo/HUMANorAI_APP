This presentation addresses the evolving landscape of cybersecurity challenges and the emergent solutions designed to mitigate them.  Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have simultaneously exacerbated and addressed vulnerabilities.  While AI-powered attacks are becoming increasingly sophisticated and difficult to detect, leveraging AI for threat detection and response offers significant potential.  We will examine the efficacy of AI-driven anomaly detection, predictive analytics for vulnerability management, and automated incident response systems.  Furthermore, the presentation will explore the growing concerns surrounding the security of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and the complexities of securing distributed ledger technologies like blockchain.  We will delve into the limitations of current solutions, including the challenges of data privacy, explainable AI, and the inherent vulnerabilities within complex interconnected systems.  Finally, the presentation will propose a framework for a holistic approach to cybersecurity, emphasizing a proactive, multi-layered defense strategy encompassing human factors, technological innovation, and robust regulatory frameworks to effectively navigate the ever-shifting threat landscape.
