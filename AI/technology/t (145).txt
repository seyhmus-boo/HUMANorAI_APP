The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted the domestic sphere, giving rise to the concept of the "smart home." This review examines the practical applications and implications of IoT within residential settings.  Smart homes leverage interconnected devices, controlled via a central hub or app, to automate and enhance various aspects of daily life.  Practical applications are widespread, ranging from energy management systems optimizing energy consumption through smart thermostats and lighting, to security enhancements offered by interconnected surveillance cameras and alarm systems.  Home automation extends to convenience features like automated lighting schedules, remotely controlled appliances, and smart speakers facilitating voice-activated control.  However, significant challenges remain.  Data privacy and security concerns regarding the collection and potential misuse of personal data are paramount.  Furthermore, the interoperability of different IoT devices from diverse manufacturers presents ongoing obstacles to seamless integration.  Despite these challenges, the growing sophistication and affordability of smart home technologies suggest continued expansion of this sector, promising increased convenience, efficiency, and security for homeowners.  Future research should prioritize addressing the aforementioned limitations to unlock the full potential of IoT in the smart home context.
