Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Recent developments have significantly advanced both fields.  

Deep learning, a subfield of ML utilizing artificial neural networks with multiple layers, has achieved remarkable success in areas like image recognition and natural language processing, surpassing human performance in certain benchmarks.  The proliferation of large language models (LLMs), trained on massive datasets, has led to advancements in conversational AI and text generation, exemplified by models like GPT-4.  Furthermore, reinforcement learning, where agents learn through trial and error, has witnessed progress in robotics and game playing, achieving superhuman levels in complex games.  However, challenges remain, including issues of bias in datasets, explainability of complex models ("black box" problem), and the ethical implications of increasingly autonomous AI systems.  Ongoing research focuses on addressing these limitations and exploring novel architectures and training methodologies to further enhance the capabilities and robustness of AI and ML.
