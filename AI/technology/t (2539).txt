Quantum computing holds immense potential to revolutionize various fields, but its realization faces significant experimental hurdles. This presentation will explore key experimental challenges hindering the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers. We will address the critical issue of qubit coherence, examining the limitations imposed by decoherence mechanisms stemming from environmental interactions and intrinsic qubit imperfections.  Further, we will discuss the difficulties in scaling up qubit numbers while maintaining high fidelity control and connectivity.  The challenges in developing high-fidelity quantum gates and minimizing cross-talk between qubits will be analyzed, highlighting the trade-offs between different qubit modalities, such as superconducting transmon, trapped ions, and neutral atoms.  Finally, we will briefly explore advancements in error correction techniques, emphasizing the need for scalable and efficient error mitigation strategies to address the inherent fragility of quantum information.  The presentation aims to provide an overview of the current landscape of experimental challenges and to stimulate discussion on the path forward toward realizing large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers.
