This presentation provides a concise overview of the rapidly evolving fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), highlighting their key concepts, applications, and current challenges.  We begin by differentiating AI as the broader concept of machines mimicking human intelligence, encompassing diverse approaches like symbolic reasoning and expert systems, while focusing primarily on the subset of ML, which utilizes algorithms to learn from and make predictions based on data.  Specific ML techniques, including supervised learning (e.g., classification, regression), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning, will be introduced alongside illustrative examples from various domains.  The presentation will then discuss the transformative impact of AI/ML across sectors such as healthcare (diagnostic tools, drug discovery), finance (fraud detection, algorithmic trading), and transportation (autonomous vehicles).  Finally, we address crucial ethical considerations and societal implications, including bias in algorithms, job displacement, and the need for responsible AI development and deployment.  The goal is to provide attendees with a foundational understanding of AI/ML and stimulate discussion on its future trajectory and potential impact.
