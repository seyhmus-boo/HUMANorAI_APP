Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, while experiencing a recent surge in popularity, possess a history rooted in early computer graphics research.  Early conceptualizations, dating back to the mid-20th century with Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) and Ivan Sutherland's "The Ultimate Display" (1968), laid the groundwork for immersive experiences.  However, technological limitations constrained early implementations.  The advent of more powerful computing resources and miniaturized sensor technology in recent decades has propelled AR and VR into mainstream attention.  This abstract focuses on the diverse applications arising from these advances.  AR applications, encompassing head-mounted displays and mobile interfaces, find utility in fields such as medical training, industrial design, and interactive gaming.  VR, offering fully immersive simulated environments, is increasingly utilized in therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD, architectural visualization, and high-fidelity flight and driving simulations.  While challenges remain, including motion sickness, cost, and accessibility, the continued refinement of hardware and software promises to broaden the scope and impact of AR and VR across numerous scientific disciplines and everyday life.  Future research should address the ethical considerations and potential biases inherent in these increasingly influential technologies.
