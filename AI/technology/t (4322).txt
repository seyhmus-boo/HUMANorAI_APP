This presentation explores the evolution of cloud computing, highlighting its increasingly interdisciplinary nature.  Initially conceived as a technological advancement in data storage and processing, cloud computing has rapidly permeated diverse fields, forging significant links with economics, sociology, and environmental science. We will examine its economic impact, from the disruption of traditional IT models to the emergence of new business ecosystems built on cloud services.  Sociological perspectives will be considered, focusing on the changing nature of work, digital inequalities, and the implications of data ownership and privacy within cloud-based systems.  Further, we will analyze the environmental footprint of cloud computing, addressing the energy consumption of data centers and the growing concerns regarding carbon emissions.  By examining these interdisciplinary connections, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of cloud computing's trajectory, moving beyond a purely technological lens to encompass its broader societal and environmental ramifications.  The presentation will conclude by considering future trends and the ongoing need for collaborative, interdisciplinary research to address the challenges and opportunities presented by this transformative technology.
