Good morning. Today's lecture will examine the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and their rapidly evolving applications.  While VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, AR overlays digital information onto the real world.  Recent advancements are significant.  In VR, advancements in haptic feedback technology are enhancing user interaction, creating a more visceral and realistic experience.  High-fidelity graphics and improved head-tracking systems contribute to enhanced immersion.  Meanwhile, AR has witnessed the proliferation of mobile-based applications, leveraging smartphone camera technology for widespread accessibility.  Furthermore, the development of AR glasses, such as those utilizing waveguides, promises a more seamless integration of digital information into our daily lives.  Applications span diverse sectors: from immersive gaming and training simulations in VR, to interactive retail experiences and remote collaboration tools in AR.  Continued research in areas like spatial computing and artificial intelligence will further propel the evolution and integration of these technologies into society.
