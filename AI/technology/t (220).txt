Artificial intelligence (AI) can be broadly conceived as the overarching goal of creating machines that exhibit human-like intelligence, encompassing a wide range of capabilities such as learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.  Imagine AI as the aspiration to build a self-driving car â€“ the ultimate objective.  Machine learning (ML), on the other hand, is a crucial subset of AI, representing a specific approach to achieving this goal.  Think of ML as the engine powering that self-driving car.  Instead of explicitly programming every driving scenario, ML algorithms allow the car to "learn" from vast amounts of driving data (e.g., images, sensor readings). This learning process, analogous to a human driver gaining experience, enables the car to progressively improve its performance without explicit instruction.  Different ML techniques, like deep learning (akin to a sophisticated neural network mimicking the human brain's complexity), offer diverse approaches to this learning process, each tailored to specific challenges in achieving the broader AI objective.  Therefore, while ML is a powerful tool within the AI arsenal, AI encompasses a much wider scope of approaches beyond learning from data.
