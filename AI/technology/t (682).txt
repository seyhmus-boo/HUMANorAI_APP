This presentation explores the burgeoning field of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, highlighting their significant interdisciplinary potential.  While individually transformative, the synergistic combination of AR and VR technologies necessitates collaborative efforts across diverse academic disciplines.  We will examine key interdisciplinary links, focusing on the contributions of computer science (in areas such as 3D modelling, interaction design, and haptic feedback), psychology (exploring user experience, immersion, and cognitive effects), and human-computer interaction (HCI) (analyzing usability, accessibility, and effective interface design).  Furthermore, we will discuss applications in fields like healthcare (surgical simulation, rehabilitation), education (immersive learning environments), and engineering (design visualization, remote collaboration).  The presentation argues that the successful development and implementation of effective AR/VR systems require a holistic, interdisciplinary approach, emphasizing the crucial role of collaboration in overcoming technical challenges and maximizing the societal impact of these technologies.  Finally, we will briefly address the ethical considerations arising from the increasingly pervasive nature of AR and VR in contemporary society.
