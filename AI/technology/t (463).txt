Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have demonstrated transformative potential across numerous scientific domains.  However, realizing their full capabilities is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  Data scarcity, particularly for specialized applications, necessitates the development of robust techniques for data augmentation and transfer learning.  The inherent complexity of many AI/ML models, including deep neural networks, poses difficulties in interpretability and model explainability, hindering the validation and trustworthiness of results.  Furthermore, experimental reproducibility remains a considerable hurdle, stemming from variations in hardware, software environments, and data preprocessing pipelines.  The computational cost associated with training complex models presents a significant barrier, demanding the development of efficient algorithms and specialized hardware.  Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted approach involving advancements in data acquisition strategies, development of more transparent and robust model architectures, establishment of standardized experimental protocols, and the exploration of computationally efficient training methods. Overcoming these limitations is crucial to unlock the full potential of AI/ML across diverse scientific endeavors.
