Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies have rapidly evolved from niche applications to pervasive tools impacting diverse sectors, from entertainment and gaming to healthcare and education.  This paper explores the burgeoning field of AR and VR applications, focusing on recent significant developments that are driving their widespread adoption.  While initial applications were largely confined to immersive gaming experiences, recent advancements in hardware, particularly in miniaturization and affordability of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and improved processing power of mobile devices, have unlocked new possibilities.  The development of sophisticated tracking systems, enabling more accurate and responsive interactions within virtual environments, is another key factor.  Furthermore, the increasing sophistication of software development kits (SDKs) and the proliferation of accessible development platforms have democratized AR/VR development, leading to a surge in creative and innovative applications. This paper will examine several key application areas, analysing both the successes and limitations of current implementations and identifying potential future trajectories for this rapidly evolving technology landscape.  The analysis will encompass ethical considerations and the potential societal impact of widespread AR/VR integration.
