The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological advancement demanding interdisciplinary collaboration across engineering, computer science, law, ethics, and social sciences.  Engineering challenges encompass sensor fusion, robust control algorithms, and safe navigation in complex, unpredictable environments. Computer science contributes through artificial intelligence (AI), particularly deep learning for perception and decision-making, and cybersecurity to mitigate vulnerabilities.  Legal frameworks are struggling to adapt to liability issues arising from accidents involving AVs, necessitating the development of novel insurance models and regulatory structures. Ethical considerations surrounding algorithmic bias, job displacement, and equitable access to AV technology require careful consideration.  Furthermore, social science research explores public acceptance, behavioural adaptations to shared autonomous mobility, and the potential impact on urban planning and infrastructure.  Successfully integrating AVs into society necessitates a holistic approach, bridging these disciplinary gaps to address technological limitations, legal uncertainties, ethical dilemmas, and societal implications.  Future research should prioritize collaborative efforts to ensure responsible and beneficial AV deployment.
