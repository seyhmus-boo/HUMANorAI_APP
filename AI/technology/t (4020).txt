Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has evolved rapidly from its nascent stages in the late 20th century to its current ubiquitous presence.  Initially characterized by simple remote storage and basic web-based applications, the field has undergone a significant transformation driven by advancements in virtualization, networking technologies, and data center infrastructure.  Early iterations, often limited to internal corporate networks, lacked the scalability and accessibility of modern cloud platforms.  The emergence of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models provided a structured framework for delivering computing resources on demand. This facilitated the proliferation of practical applications, ranging from email services (SaaS) and online gaming platforms (PaaS) to large-scale data analytics projects (IaaS) and artificial intelligence applications leveraging extensive computational power.  Furthermore, the development of serverless computing and edge computing expands cloud capabilities to even more dynamic and geographically distributed scenarios.  This ongoing evolution continues to reshape the technological landscape, prompting further innovation and integration across diverse sectors.
