Good morning. Today's lecture will delineate the relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This is achieved through algorithms that identify patterns and make predictions based on input data.

Crucially, ML empowers AI systems to adapt and improve their performance over time.  This iterative learning process underpins numerous practical applications.  In healthcare, ML algorithms diagnose diseases from medical images with remarkable accuracy.  Finance utilizes ML for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on ML for object recognition and navigation.  Furthermore,  recommendation systems in e-commerce and personalized content delivery on streaming platforms are driven by ML algorithms analyzing user behaviour.  Therefore, while AI provides the overarching goal of intelligent systems, ML furnishes the crucial mechanism to achieve it.
