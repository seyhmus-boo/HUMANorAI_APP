Good morning. Today's lecture will explore the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and their diverse applications.  Recent developments have propelled these technologies beyond gaming and entertainment.  In AR, we've witnessed significant advancements in spatial computing, enabling more accurate object recognition and overlaying of digital information onto the real world. This has led to practical applications in fields like medicine, where surgeons use AR overlays for precise navigation during complex procedures, and engineering, with AR facilitating remote collaboration and real-time design visualization.

Regarding VR, high-fidelity headsets with improved haptic feedback are enhancing immersion and interactivity.  This progress has broadened applications to training simulations, particularly in hazardous environments like flight schools and military training exercises. Furthermore, advancements in VR are revolutionising therapeutic interventions, offering immersive experiences for treating phobias and PTSD.  The convergence of AR and VR, creating mixed reality (MR) experiences, is also a rapidly developing area with profound implications across multiple sectors.  Further research will likely focus on improving accessibility and addressing the limitations of current hardware and software.
