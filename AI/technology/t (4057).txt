Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture will briefly differentiate Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  Think of AI as the overarching concept: creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. This is a broad umbrella encompassing various approaches.  ML, on the other hand, is a *subset* of AI, a specific technique for achieving intelligent behaviour.

Imagine teaching a child to identify cats.  With AI, you might program a detailed set of rules – if it has fur, whiskers, and four legs, it's a cat.  This is a *rule-based* AI system.  ML, however, takes a different approach. You’d show the child many pictures of cats and dogs, letting it learn the distinguishing features itself. This learning is based on data analysis and pattern recognition.  The child (the ML algorithm) gradually improves its cat-identification accuracy through experience, rather than explicit programming.  Therefore, ML empowers AI systems to adapt and learn from data, offering a more flexible and robust approach to problem-solving than traditional rule-based methods.
