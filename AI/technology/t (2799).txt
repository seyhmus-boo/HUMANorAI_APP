Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies represent significant advancements in human-computer interaction, finding increasingly diverse practical applications across numerous sectors.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  Practical applications include interactive training simulations for medical professionals, allowing for realistic practice scenarios without patient risk, and improved industrial maintenance procedures through real-time overlay of schematic diagrams onto machinery.  Furthermore, AR is transforming retail experiences with virtual try-on features for clothing and cosmetics, enhancing customer engagement and reducing return rates.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, offering highly realistic and interactive experiences.  This technology finds use in architectural visualization, allowing clients to explore building designs before construction, and in therapeutic settings for exposure therapy, treating phobias through controlled virtual environments.  The gaming industry also heavily utilizes VR, creating immersive and engaging gameplay experiences.  The continued development and refinement of both AR and VR technologies promise to further expand their applicability and impact across various fields.
