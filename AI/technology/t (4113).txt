Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Its conceptual roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, marking a formal inception of the field.  Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, showcasing limited success beyond constrained domains.

Machine learning (ML), a crucial subset of AI, emerged as a response to these limitations.  Instead of explicit programming, ML algorithms learn patterns from data, adapting their performance over time. This paradigm shift leveraged statistical methods and computational power advancements, leading to breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and other complex tasks.  Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning represent prominent ML approaches, each employing distinct techniques to extract knowledge from data.  The exponential growth of data availability and computing resources has propelled the current era of deep learning, a subfield of ML utilizing artificial neural networks with multiple layers, achieving unprecedented accuracy in numerous applications.  The interplay between AI and ML continues to shape technological advancements across diverse sectors.
