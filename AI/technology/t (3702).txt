This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in researching the Internet of Things (IoT) within the context of smart homes.  While the potential benefits of interconnected home devices are substantial, rigorous empirical investigation presents unique hurdles.  Data acquisition, for instance, demands robust and scalable methodologies to capture the heterogeneous data streams generated by diverse IoT devices, often operating under varying network conditions and with inconsistent data formats.  Maintaining participant privacy and ethical considerations surrounding data collection and usage necessitate carefully designed protocols and anonymization techniques.  Furthermore, replicating real-world smart home environments in controlled laboratory settings poses a significant challenge, potentially leading to artificial or limited generalizability of findings.  We will discuss these challenges through the lens of our own research experience, focusing on issues of data integration, real-time analysis, longitudinal data collection, and the development of realistic experimental scenarios that accurately reflect the complexity and dynamism of typical smart home environments.  Finally, we will propose potential solutions and best practices for overcoming these obstacles to advance the field of smart home IoT research.
