Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has evolved from early distributed computing concepts to its current ubiquitous form.  Its historical roots lie in the 1960s with time-sharing systems, offering centralized access to computing resources.  The 1990s witnessed the emergence of the internet and the development of service-oriented architectures, laying the groundwork for cloud-based services.  Early examples include email services and web hosting, showcasing the potential of remotely accessible resources.

The formalization of cloud computing as a distinct model occurred in the early 2000s, driven by advancements in virtualization and the growth of large-scale data centers.  Amazon Web Services (AWS), launched in 2006, is widely recognized as a pivotal moment, marking the commercialization and popularization of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). This spurred rapid innovation, leading to the development of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models, expanding the scope and accessibility of cloud-based solutions.  The evolution continues with a growing emphasis on serverless computing, edge computing, and the integration of artificial intelligence, reflecting the ongoing dynamism of this transformative technology.  Future developments are expected to focus on improved security, sustainability, and interoperability.
