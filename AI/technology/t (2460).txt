The future of quantum computing hinges not solely on advancements in physics and engineering, but crucially on interdisciplinary collaborations. This presentation explores the burgeoning interconnections driving the field's progress.  We will examine the crucial role of materials science in developing robust qubits with extended coherence times, highlighting recent breakthroughs in topological materials and superconducting circuits.  Furthermore, the development of error correction codes necessitates sophisticated mathematical and computer science expertise, pushing the boundaries of algorithm design and complexity theory.  The potential impact on diverse fields, from drug discovery and materials modelling (chemistry and condensed matter physics) to financial modelling and artificial intelligence (mathematics and computer science), will be discussed.  Addressing the significant challenge of scalability requires innovative approaches in engineering and cryogenics, demanding a collaborative effort to overcome technological hurdles.  Finally, we will consider the societal implications, emphasizing the need for ethical guidelines and interdisciplinary dialogues involving philosophers, social scientists, and policymakers to ensure responsible development and deployment of this transformative technology.  This presentation advocates for intensified interdisciplinary research and collaboration as essential for realizing the full potential of quantum computing.
