The Internet of Things (IoT), encompassing interconnected devices capable of data exchange, has profoundly impacted residential environments, giving rise to the concept of the smart home.  Early forms of home automation, dating back to the mid-20th century with rudimentary systems controlling lighting and temperature, laid the groundwork for today's sophisticated IoT-enabled homes.  However, the widespread adoption of ubiquitous computing and the proliferation of low-cost sensors and microcontrollers in recent decades have accelerated this development.  Contemporary smart homes leverage IoT networks to integrate a diverse range of devices, including appliances, security systems, lighting controls, and entertainment systems, enhancing convenience, energy efficiency, and security.  This integration often relies on cloud-based platforms for data management and remote control.  However, this interconnectedness raises critical concerns regarding data privacy, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and potential biases embedded within algorithms controlling these systems.  Future research should focus on mitigating these risks while maximizing the benefits of this rapidly evolving technology in fostering sustainable and secure living environments.
