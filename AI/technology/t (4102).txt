Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct concepts.  AI, in its broadest sense, encompasses the creation of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Think of AI as the overarching ambition â€“  building a machine that mimics human cognitive abilities.  Machine learning, conversely, is a specific *approach* to achieving AI.  It involves training algorithms on large datasets, enabling them to learn patterns and make predictions without explicit programming for every scenario.  Imagine teaching a child to identify cats:  AI is the goal of creating a system that can identify cats, while ML is the method of showing the system thousands of images of cats and non-cats, allowing it to develop its own internal representation and identification criteria.  Deep learning, a subset of ML, further extends this analogy; it uses layered neural networks, akin to the complex layers of processing within the human brain, to learn intricate patterns from data.  Therefore, ML represents a powerful toolkit within the broader field of AI, offering a means to build intelligent systems capable of adapting and improving their performance over time through experience, rather than relying solely on pre-programmed rules.
