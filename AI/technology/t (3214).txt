Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the experimental challenges inherent in researching Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  While AI and ML boast impressive theoretical frameworks, their practical application faces significant hurdles.  Firstly, data acquisition presents a considerable obstacle.  Sufficient, high-quality, and representative data are crucial for effective training, yet obtaining such datasets can be prohibitively expensive, time-consuming, and ethically complex.  Bias in data, often reflecting societal prejudices, leads to biased models, perpetuating inequality and undermining fairness.

Furthermore, evaluating the performance of AI systems is challenging.  Traditional metrics may not fully capture the nuances of complex tasks, and the "black box" nature of many models hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes.  Finally, the computational resources required for training advanced models are substantial, demanding specialized hardware and expertise, creating barriers to accessibility and limiting reproducibility across research groups.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is paramount for the responsible and effective development of AI and ML.
