Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the experimental challenges inherent in researching Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications.  A primary hurdle lies in establishing robust methodologies for evaluating user experience.  Subjective metrics, like presence and immersion, are difficult to quantify objectively, requiring sophisticated psychometric tools and careful experimental design to minimize bias.  Furthermore, the technological limitations of current AR/VR hardware present significant challenges.  Latency, resolution limitations, and field-of-view constraints directly impact user experience and can confound experimental results.  Controlling for these factors necessitates rigorous calibration and precise experimental protocols, often requiring specialized equipment and expertise.  Finally, the ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, user safety, and potential adverse effects on cognitive functions are paramount and require careful consideration in experimental design and data analysis, presenting a further layer of complexity in this rapidly evolving field.  Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing the development and responsible application of AR/VR technologies.
