Cloud computing has rapidly evolved from a niche technology to a ubiquitous paradigm shift in information technology. This presentation traces the key stages of this evolution, highlighting significant technological advancements and their impact on industry adoption.  Initially characterized by Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), focusing primarily on virtualized compute, storage, and networking resources, the cloud landscape has diversified to encompass Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models, facilitating rapid application development and deployment.  We will examine the pivotal role of virtualization, containerization, and serverless computing in driving this diversification, alongside the rise of edge computing as a complementary architecture.  Further, the presentation will analyze the ongoing evolution towards more intelligent and autonomous cloud systems, fueled by advancements in artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Finally, we will discuss the emergent challenges, such as security, data sovereignty, and sustainability, that accompany this transformative technology and require ongoing research and development efforts to ensure responsible and ethical cloud adoption.
