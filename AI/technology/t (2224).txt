The Internet of Things (IoT) significantly impacts smart home technology, transforming residences into interconnected ecosystems of devices communicating via the internet. This paradigm shift transcends simple automation, enabling sophisticated functionalities driven by data collection and analysis.  Smart home IoT systems integrate diverse devices, including smart appliances (refrigerators, thermostats), security systems (sensors, cameras), lighting controls, and entertainment systems.  Practical applications demonstrate this impact: automated energy management optimizes resource consumption based on occupancy and external factors, improving energy efficiency and reducing costs.  Smart security systems enhance home safety through real-time monitoring and automated alerts.  Moreover, remote control functionalities allow users to manage their homes remotely, adjusting lighting, temperature, and appliance operation from any location.  However, challenges remain, including data privacy concerns, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and the potential for interoperability issues between devices from different manufacturers.  Future research must focus on addressing these limitations to fully realize the potential of IoT in smart home environments.
