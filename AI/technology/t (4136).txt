Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the experimental hurdles impeding the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers. While theoretical advancements are prolific, significant challenges remain in transitioning from laboratory demonstrations to practical devices.  Qubit coherence, the preservation of quantum superposition, is a paramount issue. Environmental noise readily decoheres qubits, limiting computation time and accuracy.  Scaling up the number of qubits presents another formidable obstacle; maintaining precise control and connectivity across a large-scale system is exponentially complex.  Furthermore, qubit fabrication demands extreme precision and uniformity, pushing the boundaries of current nanofabrication techniques. Error correction codes, essential for mitigating noise, are computationally expensive, requiring a substantial overhead in qubits and control operations.  Overcoming these experimental challenges, encompassing materials science, engineering, and control theory, represents a critical path towards a viable quantum computing future.  Further research in topological quantum computing and novel qubit architectures may offer pathways to circumvent some of these limitations.
