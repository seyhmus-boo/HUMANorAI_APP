This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications. While current AR/VR technologies rely on classical computation, the inherent limitations of these systems – computational power, data processing speed, and realism – suggest a compelling avenue for quantum advancements. We will examine how quantum computing's superior capabilities in simulating complex systems could revolutionize rendering, physics engines, and user interaction within AR/VR environments.  Specifically, we will discuss the potential of quantum algorithms to accelerate ray tracing, enabling unprecedented levels of photorealism in virtual worlds.  Furthermore, we will explore the application of quantum machine learning for generating more realistic and dynamic virtual environments, improving object recognition within AR systems, and personalizing user experiences.  Challenges in harnessing quantum resources for AR/VR, including issues of scalability and error correction, will also be addressed.  Finally, the presentation will speculate on the potential for future quantum-enhanced AR/VR technologies to impact fields ranging from scientific visualization and medical training to entertainment and design, fostering a new era of immersive and interactive experiences.
