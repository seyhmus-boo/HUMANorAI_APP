This review examines the burgeoning applications of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies across diverse sectors.  While distinct, AR and VR are converging, offering synergistic possibilities.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, finding utility in areas such as medical training (surgical simulations), industrial maintenance (remote expert guidance), and retail (virtual try-ons).  Its limitations include the need for robust hardware and potential for distraction.  VR, conversely, immerses users in entirely simulated environments, with applications spanning entertainment (gaming, virtual tourism), education (interactive learning experiences), and therapy (exposure therapy for phobias).  However, VR suffers from limitations like motion sickness, high cost of entry, and potential for social isolation.  Recent advancements in haptic feedback and user interface design are mitigating some of these challenges, driving innovation in both fields.  This review concludes that while challenges remain, AR and VR technologies demonstrate substantial potential to revolutionize numerous sectors, demanding further research into user experience, accessibility, and ethical implications to unlock their full transformative capabilities.
