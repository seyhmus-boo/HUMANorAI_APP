Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly intertwined fields driving significant technological advancements. AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating intelligent agents, utilizes ML as a crucial subset.  ML algorithms enable systems to learn from data without explicit programming, identifying patterns and making predictions. This learning process occurs through various techniques, including supervised learning (using labeled data), unsupervised learning (uncovering patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).

Practical applications are pervasive.  In healthcare, ML algorithms power diagnostic tools, predict patient outcomes, and personalize treatments.  Finance leverages AI for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment.  Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on AI for navigation and object recognition.  Furthermore, natural language processing (NLP), a subfield of AI, fuels applications like chatbots, language translation, and sentiment analysis.  The continued development and refinement of AI and ML algorithms promise to revolutionize numerous sectors, although ethical considerations regarding bias, transparency, and job displacement necessitate careful scrutiny and responsible implementation.
