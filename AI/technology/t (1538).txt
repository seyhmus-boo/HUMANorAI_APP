Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet complementary technological advancements impacting diverse sectors. AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones or headsets.  This allows for practical applications such as interactive product visualization in retail (e.g., furniture placement in a home), real-time navigation systems supplementing GPS data with visual cues, and medical training simulations offering realistic anatomical models for practice.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, creating a sense of presence within a digital space.  Its applications span entertainment (immersive gaming), education (historical recreations, virtual field trips), and therapy (exposure therapy for phobias).

The convergence of AR and VR is also notable, leading to mixed reality (MR) applications.  MR systems blend real and virtual worlds more seamlessly, enabling interactive experiences where virtual objects can realistically interact with physical surroundings.  This holds potential for advanced engineering design, collaborative remote work environments, and even surgical planning using overlaid 3D models on a patient's anatomy.  The ongoing development and refinement of these technologies promise further innovation across numerous fields.
