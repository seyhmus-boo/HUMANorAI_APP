This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in researching the Internet of Things (IoT) within the context of smart homes.  While the promise of interconnected, automated homes is significant, rigorous empirical investigation faces considerable hurdles.  We focus on three key areas:  first, the heterogeneity of IoT devices, encompassing diverse communication protocols and data formats, complicates data acquisition and standardized analysis. Second, ensuring experimental validity in ecologically valid settings presents difficulties. Replicating real-world usage patterns and environmental factors within a controlled laboratory environment is challenging and potentially compromises generalizability.  Third, ethical considerations are paramount.  Data privacy, security vulnerabilities, and potential biases arising from participant selection and data interpretation require careful consideration and mitigation throughout the experimental design and execution.  The presentation will detail these challenges using specific examples from ongoing research projects, outlining strategies for addressing them and proposing a framework for robust experimentation in the field of smart home IoT.  We ultimately argue for the necessity of interdisciplinary collaboration and a rigorous, ethical approach to advance this rapidly evolving field.
