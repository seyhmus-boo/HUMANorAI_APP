This presentation explores the burgeoning field of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, examining their diverse implementations across various sectors.  We will analyze the fundamental technological distinctions between AR, which overlays digital information onto the real world, and VR, which creates entirely immersive digital environments.  The presentation will showcase case studies illustrating the practical applications of both technologies.  Examples include the use of AR in medical training for enhanced surgical simulations and in architectural visualization for improved client engagement.  Furthermore, the transformative potential of VR in therapeutic interventions for anxiety disorders and PTSD, as well as its impact on remote collaboration and immersive education will be discussed.  We will also critically address the current limitations and challenges associated with widespread adoption, including cost, accessibility, and potential ethical concerns related to data privacy and user experience.  The presentation concludes by considering future trends and the likely evolution of AR/VR technologies, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize numerous aspects of human life and interaction.
