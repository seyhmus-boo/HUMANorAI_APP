Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Its conceptual origins trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, marking the formal inception of the field.  Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, aiming to codify human knowledge into rule-based programs.

Machine learning (ML), a subfield of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data, enabling adaptation and improved performance without explicit programming.  This paradigm shift leveraged advancements in computing power and the availability of large datasets.  Different ML approaches exist, including supervised learning (using labeled data), unsupervised learning (identifying patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).  The synergy between AI and ML drives significant advancements across diverse domains, from natural language processing and computer vision to robotics and healthcare.  Ongoing research explores more robust, explainable, and ethically aligned AI and ML systems.
