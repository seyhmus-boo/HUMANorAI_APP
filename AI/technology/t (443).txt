This presentation examines the ascendance of autonomous vehicles (AVs), tracing their evolution from early conceptualizations to the current state of technological development and societal impact.  Early research, dating back to the 1920s, explored the potential for automated driving, albeit with limited technological feasibility.  Significant advancements in computing power, sensor technology (LiDAR, radar, cameras), and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms in recent decades have propelled the field forward, leading to the development of increasingly sophisticated AV systems.  We will explore key milestones, including the DARPA Grand Challenges, which spurred innovation and competition, and the subsequent emergence of major automotive manufacturers and tech companies as key players in AV development.  The presentation will further analyze the challenges hindering widespread AV adoption, including regulatory hurdles, ethical considerations surrounding accident liability and algorithmic bias, and the need for robust cybersecurity measures.  Finally, we will discuss the potential transformative effects of AVs on transportation systems, urban planning, and the wider economy, alongside the associated societal and employment implications.
