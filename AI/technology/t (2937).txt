The proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological and societal shift.  This lecture examines the key factors driving this rise, focusing on converging technological advancements.  Advances in sensor technology, encompassing LiDAR, radar, and computer vision, provide the crucial sensory input for robust environmental perception.  Simultaneously, significant progress in artificial intelligence, specifically deep learning algorithms, enables the processing of this complex data for decision-making and control.  Furthermore, the decreasing cost of computing power makes these sophisticated systems increasingly feasible for mass production.  However, the adoption of AVs is not solely technological; supportive policy frameworks, evolving public perception, and the development of robust cybersecurity protocols are critical considerations.  The lecture concludes by outlining the potential societal impacts, including transformative changes to transportation, logistics, and urban planning, alongside challenges concerning ethical implications, job displacement, and regulatory oversight.
