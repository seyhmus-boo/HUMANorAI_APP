Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, conceptually dating back to Alan Turing's seminal work in the 1950s, encompasses the broader goal of creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, achieving limited success.  However, the limitations of these approaches became apparent, paving the way for the rise of ML.

ML, a subset of AI, leverages statistical methods to enable systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and relationships within datasets, allowing for improved prediction and decision-making. This paradigm shift, spurred by increased computational power and data availability, led to the breakthroughs witnessed in recent decades, particularly in deep learning, a subfield employing artificial neural networks with multiple layers.  Therefore, while AI represents the overarching ambition, ML provides a crucial methodological toolkit for achieving its goals, pushing the boundaries of what machines can accomplish.
