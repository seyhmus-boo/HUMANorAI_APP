This presentation explores the evolving landscape of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, tracing their historical development and examining current trends.  Early conceptualizations of immersive technologies, dating back to Morton Heilig's Sensorama in the 1950s and Ivan Sutherland's "Sword of Damocles" in the 1960s, laid the groundwork for today's sophisticated systems.  However, limitations in processing power and display technology significantly hampered their initial progress.

The recent proliferation of powerful mobile devices and advancements in computing power have fueled a resurgence, leading to a wide range of applications across diverse sectors.  We will discuss the key distinctions between AR, which overlays digital information onto the real world, and VR, which creates entirely simulated environments.  Examples will include the use of AR in medical training, architectural visualization, and retail experiences, alongside VR's applications in gaming, therapeutic interventions, and engineering simulations.  The presentation will conclude by considering the future trajectory of these technologies, highlighting ongoing challenges such as user experience design, accessibility, and ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and the potential for immersive technology addiction.
