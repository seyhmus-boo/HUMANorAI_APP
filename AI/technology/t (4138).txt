Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on cloud computing and its remarkable evolution.  Initially conceived as a utility computing model offering on-demand resources, cloud computing has undergone significant transformation.  Early iterations, primarily characterized by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), provided basic virtualized hardware.  However, subsequent development saw the emergence of Platform as a Service (PaaS), enabling simplified application development and deployment, and Software as a Service (SaaS), delivering readily available software applications over the internet.

Recent advancements are marked by a confluence of factors.  Serverless computing, eliminating the need for server management, is gaining prominence.  Furthermore, the rise of edge computing addresses latency concerns by processing data closer to its source, enhancing real-time applications.  Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are increasingly integrated within cloud infrastructures, facilitating automation and predictive analytics.  Finally, significant progress in cybersecurity measures is crucial for maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of data within the ever-expanding cloud ecosystem.  These developments promise further growth and innovation within the field.
