The burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) present significant experimental challenges.  A key obstacle lies in achieving seamless integration between the real and virtual worlds in AR.  Precise spatial mapping and object recognition remain problematic, particularly in dynamic environments where lighting conditions and occlusions constantly change.  Maintaining accurate registration and preventing latency issues, which can induce cybersickness, requires sophisticated sensor fusion and computationally intensive processing.

In VR, experimental challenges centre on enhancing user experience and mitigating negative effects.  Achieving high-fidelity visual and haptic feedback that convincingly simulates real-world sensations presents a formidable technological hurdle.  The limitations of current display technology, such as field of view and resolution, impact immersion and realism.  Furthermore, long-term effects of VR immersion on users' cognitive and physiological well-being require further investigation, necessitating rigorous experimental methodologies to assess potential risks.  Finally, the creation of truly intuitive and natural interaction methods, transcending current controller-based interfaces, represents an ongoing area of research.
