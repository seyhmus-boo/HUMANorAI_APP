Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related advancements in human-computer interaction, fundamentally altering how we perceive and interact with our environment.  AR, analogous to adding digital annotations to a physical map, overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real world, enhancing our perception of reality. Think of Pokemon Go, where digital creatures appear within the user's physical surroundings.  This technology finds applications in fields ranging from interactive gaming and retail displays to surgical planning and engineering design, enabling intuitive interaction with complex data within a familiar context.

Conversely, VR constructs entirely immersive, simulated environments, akin to stepping inside a meticulously crafted diorama.  The user is completely detached from the physical world, interacting with a computer-generated reality through sensory input devices like headsets and haptic suits.  Applications span training simulations for high-risk professions, such as flight training or surgical practice, and therapeutic interventions for phobias or PTSD.  While AR enhances the real, VR replaces it, offering unique opportunities for experiential learning and therapeutic interventions not feasible within the constraints of the physical world.  Both technologies leverage advances in computer graphics, sensor technology, and human-computer interfaces to create powerful new modalities for interaction and experience.
