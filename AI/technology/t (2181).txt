Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet, represents a significant paradigm shift in information technology.  Its evolution is traceable to earlier concepts like time-sharing systems and utility computing in the 1960s and 70s, which prefigured the distributed nature of cloud services.  The advent of the internet and the World Wide Web in the 1990s provided the necessary infrastructure for scalable, remotely accessible computing.  Early examples of cloud-like services emerged with the rise of application service providers (ASPs) offering software applications over the internet.  However, the true genesis of modern cloud computing is often attributed to the early 2000s, with the emergence of companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS), offering Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) through platforms like Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2).  This marked a crucial transition from proprietary infrastructure to a pay-as-you-go model, fostering innovation and accessibility.  Subsequent developments witnessed the introduction of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), further diversifying cloud offerings and solidifying its role as a dominant force in contemporary IT landscapes.  The continuous evolution of cloud computing continues today, driven by advancements in virtualization, big data analytics, and artificial intelligence.
