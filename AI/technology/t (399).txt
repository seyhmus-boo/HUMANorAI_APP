This presentation explores the increasingly crucial interdisciplinary nature of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  While traditionally rooted in computer science and mathematics, AI and ML's transformative potential necessitates collaboration across diverse fields.  We will examine key interdisciplinary links, highlighting the synergistic benefits derived from these collaborations.  Specifically, we will discuss the application of ML in biological sciences, focusing on advancements in drug discovery and personalized medicine through genomic data analysis.  Furthermore, the integration of AI in social sciences will be explored, demonstrating its use in analyzing complex social phenomena and predicting societal trends through the processing of large-scale textual and social media data.  The ethical implications arising from these interdisciplinary applications will also be addressed, emphasizing the need for robust frameworks to mitigate potential biases and ensure responsible AI development and deployment.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the challenges and future directions of interdisciplinary AI research, emphasizing the need for cross-disciplinary training and collaborative research initiatives to fully realize the potential of AI and ML.
