This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on their practical applications across diverse fields.  We will begin by differentiating AI and ML, clarifying their respective scopes and capabilities.  AI encompasses the broader goal of creating intelligent agents capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, while ML constitutes a subset of AI focused on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.

The presentation will then explore several key ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, illustrating their strengths and limitations through relevant examples. We will subsequently showcase practical applications across various sectors.  Examples include medical diagnosis using image recognition algorithms, personalized recommendations in e-commerce leveraging collaborative filtering, and fraud detection in finance utilizing anomaly detection techniques.  Furthermore, we will touch upon the ethical considerations and potential societal impacts associated with the widespread deployment of AI and ML systems, highlighting the importance of responsible innovation and algorithmic transparency.  Finally, we will briefly discuss future research directions and emerging trends within the field.
