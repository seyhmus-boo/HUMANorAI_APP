This presentation explores the burgeoning intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home technology.  We will examine the foundational elements of IoT architecture within the domestic sphere, focusing on the communication protocols, data management strategies, and security considerations unique to this context.  Beyond the theoretical framework, the presentation will delve into practical applications currently transforming residential living.  We will analyze examples such as automated energy management systems leveraging smart meters and intelligent thermostats to optimize energy consumption; security systems integrating intelligent surveillance, access control, and emergency response mechanisms; and convenience-enhancing applications including voice-activated assistants for home automation, remote appliance control, and personalized ambient lighting.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the ethical implications of pervasive IoT deployment in the home, including data privacy concerns and the potential for vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.  Finally, we will briefly consider future trends in smart home technology, highlighting areas of ongoing research and development.
