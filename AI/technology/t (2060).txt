This presentation examines the multifaceted cybersecurity landscape, highlighting the critical need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address emerging challenges.  The ever-evolving nature of cyber threats necessitates a move beyond traditional computer science approaches, demanding integration of expertise from diverse fields.  We will explore how disciplines such as social sciences (understanding human behavior in relation to security practices), law (legal frameworks and regulations), and economics (cost-benefit analyses of security investments) contribute to a more robust and holistic security posture.  The presentation will analyze specific case studies demonstrating the vulnerabilities arising from a siloed approach, such as insufficient user training (social sciences) leading to phishing attacks, and the lack of legal clarity surrounding data breaches (law).  We will then propose a framework for interdisciplinary collaboration, outlining how the synergy of diverse perspectives can lead to more effective solutions.  This framework will emphasize the importance of shared language, collaborative research methodologies, and the development of interdisciplinary training programs to cultivate a more resilient and adaptive cybersecurity ecosystem.  Finally, the presentation will discuss the future directions of this crucial area of research and development.
