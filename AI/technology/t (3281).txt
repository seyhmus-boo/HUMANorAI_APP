The ascendance of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological shift, comparable to the transition from horse-drawn carriages to automobiles in the early 20th century.  Just as the internal combustion engine revolutionized personal transportation, sophisticated sensor suites, artificial intelligence, and machine learning algorithms are fundamentally altering the paradigm of vehicular movement.  Initially, like the early, unreliable automobiles, AV technology faced considerable hurdles.  The complex interplay of perception (identifying objects, similar to a driver's visual acuity), planning (navigating routes, analogous to a driver's decision-making), and control (executing maneuvers, mirroring a driver's physical actions) required significant breakthroughs.  Progress, however, has been exponential, mirroring Moore's Law in the advancement of computing power.  Furthermore, the development of AVs follows a pattern analogous to the evolution of flight; early attempts were rudimentary and prone to failure, but through iterative improvements in engineering and software, reliability and safety are steadily increasing.  The full integration of AVs into society remains a complex undertaking, yet the trajectory suggests a future where autonomous transportation is as commonplace as the automobile is today.
