5G networks, while primarily classical systems, present intriguing opportunities and challenges from a quantum mechanical perspective.  Their high bandwidth and low latency capabilities offer potential advantages for quantum communication protocols, enabling faster and more robust transmission of entangled photons crucial for quantum key distribution (QKD) and quantum teleportation.  However, the dense deployment of 5G infrastructure introduces sources of noise and decoherence, impacting the fidelity of quantum states.  Specifically, electromagnetic interference from 5G base stations, though generally minor compared to other sources, may contribute to qubit dephasing and reduced coherence times in nearby quantum systems.  Furthermore, the increased data traffic associated with 5G necessitates the development of advanced error correction codes for quantum communication, demanding further investigation into the theoretical limits of error correction in noisy channels. This necessitates a thorough investigation of the interplay between classical noise from 5G infrastructure and quantum phenomena to ensure the successful integration of quantum technologies within existing 5G networks and future 6G advancements.  Future research should focus on quantifying the impact of 5G electromagnetic radiation on various qubit modalities and designing robust quantum communication protocols mitigating these effects.
