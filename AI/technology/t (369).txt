The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a culmination of decades of research in artificial intelligence, robotics, and sensor technologies.  Early conceptualizations emerged in the mid-20th century, with General Motors showcasing experimental driverless vehicles as early as the 1950s. However, significant technological limitations, primarily in computational power and sensor accuracy, hampered progress.  The late 20th and early 21st centuries witnessed substantial advancements in these areas, fuelled by the burgeoning fields of computer vision and machine learning.  DARPA's Grand Challenge, initiating in 2004, provided a crucial catalyst, fostering competition and innovation within the AV sector.

This period saw the transition from rule-based systems to more sophisticated, data-driven approaches.  The proliferation of GPS technology and the development of robust sensor suites, including lidar and radar, further propelled the technological feasibility of AVs.  Currently, we are witnessing a gradual shift from experimental prototypes towards commercially viable autonomous systems, albeit with ongoing challenges regarding ethical considerations, regulatory frameworks, and the integration of AVs into existing transportation infrastructure.
