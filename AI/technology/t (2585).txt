Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on cloud computing and its evolutionary trajectory.  Initially conceived as a means to provide on-demand computing resources, cloud computing has rapidly evolved from rudimentary grid computing models to the sophisticated, multi-faceted systems we utilize today.  Early iterations, predominantly focused on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), provided virtualized hardware.  This foundational layer facilitated the subsequent development of Platform as a Service (PaaS), offering development environments and deployment capabilities, and Software as a Service (SaaS), delivering ready-to-use applications directly to end-users.

This evolution has been spurred by technological advancements in virtualization, networking, and storage.  The practical applications are ubiquitous.  From streaming services like Netflix leveraging cloud infrastructure for content delivery, to businesses utilizing SaaS for CRM and ERP systems, the impact is profound.  Furthermore, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning is heavily reliant upon cloud-based infrastructure for processing vast datasets.  The future of cloud computing promises even greater integration and sophistication, with the potential to reshape numerous sectors, from healthcare and finance to education and manufacturing.
