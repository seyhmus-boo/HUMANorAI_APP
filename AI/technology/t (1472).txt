Cloud computing has undergone a rapid and transformative evolution since its inception, progressing from rudimentary networked storage to a sophisticated ecosystem of services. This review summarizes key stages in this evolution, highlighting the shift from Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), characterized by virtualized hardware provisioning, through Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), offering development environments and middleware, to the increasingly prevalent Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) model, delivering fully functional applications.  Significant advancements in virtualization, containerization, and serverless architectures have fueled this progress, enhancing scalability, agility, and cost-effectiveness.  Furthermore, the emergence of edge computing and the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are reshaping the cloud landscape, enabling decentralized processing and intelligent automation.  While significant challenges remain regarding security, data sovereignty, and vendor lock-in, the continued innovation in cloud technologies promises to further disrupt various sectors and drive advancements across diverse applications.  Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and exploring the potential of hybrid and multi-cloud deployments to optimize resource utilization and resilience.
