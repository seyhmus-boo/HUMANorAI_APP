Good morning. Today's lecture examines the evolution of cloud computing and the inherent experimental challenges it presents.  Initially, cloud computing emerged from the virtualization of resources, offering scalable on-demand services.  Early experiments focused on resource allocation algorithms and the efficacy of distributed systems, grappling with issues like fault tolerance and data consistency across geographically dispersed servers.

The subsequent move towards "cloud-native" architectures introduced new complexities.  Experimentation now involves testing the resilience of microservices, container orchestration, and serverless functions under diverse stress conditions. Reproducibility remains a significant challenge, as varied network configurations and underlying hardware impact experimental outcomes. Furthermore, evaluating security measures within a dynamic cloud environment requires sophisticated methodologies capable of detecting vulnerabilities in constantly evolving infrastructure.  The scale and complexity inherent in modern cloud deployments necessitate innovative experimental designs, focusing on controlled simulations and rigorous statistical analysis to overcome these hurdles and drive future development.
