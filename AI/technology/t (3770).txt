Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, finding diverse applications across numerous sectors.  This presentation explores the key distinctions and applications of both paradigms.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  Examples include interactive gaming, navigation systems, and medical training simulations where virtual anatomical models are superimposed onto a patient.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, isolating them from the physical world via headsets and haptic feedback devices.  Applications span entertainment (e.g., gaming, virtual tourism),  engineering (e.g., design visualization, virtual prototyping), and therapeutic interventions (e.g., exposure therapy for phobias).  While both technologies share the goal of enhancing user experience through digital interfaces, their distinct approaches offer unique advantages depending on the application's specific requirements. The ongoing development of more sophisticated hardware and software promises to further broaden the scope and impact of AR and VR across diverse fields.
