Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly transforming various sectors, from entertainment and gaming to healthcare and education.  However, the widespread adoption of these immersive technologies hinges on overcoming significant experimental challenges that currently limit their efficacy and user experience.  This paper explores the key experimental hurdles hindering the development and deployment of robust AR and VR applications.  We focus on three primary areas:  first, the development of robust and intuitive interaction paradigms that seamlessly bridge the gap between the physical and virtual worlds, addressing issues such as motion sickness, input latency, and the limitations of current input devices. Second, we examine the challenges inherent in creating realistic and believable virtual environments, including the rendering of high-fidelity graphics, realistic physics simulations, and the generation of dynamic, responsive virtual agents. Finally, we address the significant methodological challenges associated with conducting rigorous user studies in immersive environments, encompassing considerations of experimental design, data collection techniques, and the appropriate statistical analysis of often complex and multi-modal datasets. By critically examining these experimental limitations, this paper aims to illuminate pathways towards more effective and impactful AR and VR applications.
