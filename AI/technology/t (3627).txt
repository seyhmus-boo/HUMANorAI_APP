Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming numerous sectors, yet their distinctions remain crucial.  This lecture elucidates the fundamental relationship between these fields. AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, including learning, reasoning, and problem-solving.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses specifically on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming. This learning occurs through algorithms that identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time.  The lecture explores key ML paradigms such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, demonstrating how each contributes to the broader AI landscape.  Examples encompassing natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics illustrate the practical applications of these technologies, while ethical considerations surrounding bias and transparency are briefly addressed. Ultimately, the lecture emphasizes the synergistic nature of AI and ML, highlighting their transformative potential and the ongoing challenges in their responsible development and deployment.
