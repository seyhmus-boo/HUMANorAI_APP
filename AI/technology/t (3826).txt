The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has revolutionized numerous fields, yet their underlying computational architectures remain largely rooted in classical computation.  This presents a significant bottleneck, particularly when addressing complex problems requiring exponentially increasing computational resources.  This research explores the potential of quantum mechanics to overcome these limitations, examining the intersection of quantum computing and AI/ML.  While classical algorithms underpin current AI successes, their inherent limitations in handling high-dimensional data and solving NP-hard problems motivate the investigation of quantum alternatives.  This paper investigates the theoretical and practical implications of leveraging quantum phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to enhance the capabilities of AI and ML. We will analyze existing quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms, focusing on their advantages and limitations compared to their classical counterparts.  Specifically, we will examine the potential of quantum algorithms for tasks such as pattern recognition, optimization, and data classification, considering both the theoretical speedups offered and the practical challenges of building and implementing fault-tolerant quantum computers.  Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the synergistic relationship between quantum mechanics and the future of AI and ML.
