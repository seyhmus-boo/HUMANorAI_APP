Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, the broader concept, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Its conceptual roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, a seminal event marking the field's formal inception.  Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, achieving limited success.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of explicit programming, ML algorithms learn patterns from data, adapting and improving their performance over time. This paradigm shift, fueled by increasing computational power and the availability of vast datasets, has driven recent breakthroughs.  Key ML techniques include supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding structure in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error). The synergy between AI's overarching goal and ML's powerful techniques is reshaping numerous sectors, from healthcare to finance, promising both immense opportunities and significant ethical considerations.
