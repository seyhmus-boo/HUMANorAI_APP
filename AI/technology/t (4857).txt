The Internet of Things (IoT) has rapidly transformed residential environments, giving rise to the concept of the smart home.  Early precursors to the smart home, such as automated lighting systems and programmable thermostats, emerged in the late 20th century, but lacked the interconnectedness and data-driven capabilities enabled by widespread internet access and miniaturized computing. The true genesis of the modern smart home lies in the convergence of these technological advancements during the early 21st century, facilitating the integration of numerous devices – from appliances and security systems to entertainment and energy management systems – onto a single network. This interconnectedness allows for remote monitoring and control, automation through data analysis, and enhanced user convenience. However, the proliferation of IoT devices in smart homes also presents challenges, including concerns about data security and privacy, energy consumption, and potential vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Future research should focus on developing robust security protocols, energy-efficient architectures, and user-friendly interfaces to realize the full potential of smart homes while mitigating inherent risks.  The evolution of smart home technology represents a significant paradigm shift in residential living, impacting energy consumption, lifestyle choices, and the overall human-environment interaction.
