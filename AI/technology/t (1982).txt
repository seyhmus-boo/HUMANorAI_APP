This presentation examines the escalating cybersecurity challenges of the digital age and proposes solutions that leverage interdisciplinary collaboration.  The increasingly interconnected nature of our world, encompassing critical infrastructure, financial systems, and personal data, necessitates a move beyond traditional computer science approaches.  We argue that effective cybersecurity requires a multifaceted strategy encompassing social sciences, law, and behavioural economics alongside technological solutions.  The presentation will explore specific challenges, such as the human element in security breaches (phishing, social engineering), the legal frameworks surrounding data protection and cybercrime, and the ethical implications of AI-driven security measures.  We will further analyze the benefits of interdisciplinary research in addressing these issues, highlighting case studies illustrating successful collaborations between computer scientists, sociologists, legal experts, and economists.  Finally, we propose a framework for fostering such collaborations, emphasizing the creation of interdisciplinary research centers and curricula designed to cultivate a holistic understanding of the complex cybersecurity landscape.  This approach is crucial for developing robust and adaptable security measures capable of mitigating future threats.
