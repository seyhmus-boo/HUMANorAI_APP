Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming numerous scientific disciplines.  This abstract provides a concise overview of these interconnected fields. AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating intelligent agents, leverages ML algorithms to achieve this objective.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling computer systems to learn from data without explicit programming, relying on statistical techniques to identify patterns and make predictions.  Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning represent key ML paradigms, each suited to different data types and learning objectives.  Recent advancements, such as deep learning architectures employing artificial neural networks, have significantly improved the performance of ML models across various tasks, including image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modeling.  However, challenges remain, notably in addressing issues of data bias, model interpretability ("black box" problem), and computational resource demands.  Future research should concentrate on developing more robust, explainable, and ethically sound AI/ML systems, ensuring their responsible deployment across diverse applications.
