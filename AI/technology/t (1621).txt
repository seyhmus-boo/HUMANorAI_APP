This presentation explores the intersection of blockchain technology and quantum mechanics, examining potential synergies and challenges. While current blockchain implementations rely on classical cryptographic techniques, their inherent vulnerabilities to future quantum computing pose a significant threat to their long-term security.  We will analyze the implications of Shor's algorithm, which can efficiently factor large numbers used in RSA encryption – a cornerstone of many blockchain systems – highlighting the urgent need for quantum-resistant cryptography within blockchain architecture.  The presentation will then discuss promising avenues for quantum-enhanced blockchain functionalities, including potential improvements in consensus mechanisms through quantum entanglement-based protocols and the exploration of quantum key distribution (QKD) for enhanced security.  Finally, we will address the practical limitations and scalability issues associated with integrating quantum technologies into blockchain systems, considering the current technological maturity and resource demands of quantum computing.  The discussion will conclude by outlining future research directions aimed at realizing the full potential of a quantum-secure and quantum-enhanced blockchain ecosystem.
