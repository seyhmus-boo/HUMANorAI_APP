The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) is not solely an engineering challenge, but also subtly intertwined with quantum mechanics. While classical physics governs the macroscopic behaviour of the vehicle, several underlying technologies rely on quantum phenomena.  GPS navigation, crucial for AV localization, relies on atomic clocks exhibiting extreme precision, a direct consequence of quantized energy levels in atoms.  These clocks leverage the stability of quantum transitions for highly accurate timekeeping, essential for precise positioning.  Similarly, LiDAR sensors, vital for object detection, utilize the quantum nature of light.  Photon emission and detection events are inherently probabilistic, dictated by quantum electrodynamics, impacting the accuracy and reliability of distance measurements.  Furthermore, the development of advanced AI algorithms driving AV decision-making relies on quantum computing research, although practical quantum computers for this application remain in nascent stages.  Progress in quantum annealing and quantum machine learning could eventually lead to significantly improved computational efficiency for processing complex sensor data and navigating unpredictable environments.  Therefore, despite the predominantly classical engineering design, the functioning and future advancements of AVs are deeply rooted in the principles of quantum mechanics.
