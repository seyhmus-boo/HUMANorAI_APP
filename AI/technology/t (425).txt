The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) signifies a paradigm shift in transportation, promising enhanced safety, efficiency, and accessibility. This presentation examines the key technological advancements driving this rapid evolution, focusing on advancements in sensor fusion, machine learning algorithms, and high-definition mapping.  We analyze the interplay between these technological components, highlighting the challenges in achieving robust perception, decision-making, and control in complex and unpredictable real-world environments.  Furthermore, we discuss the critical ethical and societal implications arising from the increasing autonomy of vehicles, including considerations of liability, job displacement, and equitable access.  The presentation will also address the current regulatory landscape, exploring the diverse approaches adopted globally to ensure safe and responsible deployment.  Finally, we offer a prospective outlook on the future trajectory of AV technology, acknowledging both the immense potential and the persistent hurdles that must be overcome before widespread adoption becomes a reality.  The analysis will be supported by recent research findings and case studies from leading AV developers.
