Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation. Its conceptual roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, a pivotal event that formally established the field and spurred early research into symbolic reasoning and problem-solving.  However, initial optimism was tempered by limitations in computing power and the complexity of real-world problems.  Machine learning, a subfield of AI, emerged as a more practical approach, focusing on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Early ML algorithms, such as decision trees and naive Bayes classifiers, relied on statistical methods to identify patterns and make predictions.  The subsequent exponential growth of data availability, coupled with advancements in computing power and algorithmic development – particularly the rise of deep learning – has fueled a resurgence in AI and ML, leading to breakthroughs in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.  This contemporary landscape is characterized by increasingly sophisticated algorithms and their application across numerous sectors, raising both significant opportunities and ethical considerations.
