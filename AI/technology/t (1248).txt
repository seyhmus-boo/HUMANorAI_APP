This presentation examines the evolving landscape of cybersecurity challenges and explores contemporary solutions designed to mitigate emerging threats.  Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly impacted both the offensive and defensive sides of cybersecurity.  While AI-powered tools enhance threat detection and response capabilities, malicious actors increasingly leverage AI for sophisticated attacks, including advanced phishing campaigns and the generation of highly realistic malware.  The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices expands the attack surface exponentially, necessitating robust security protocols across diverse, interconnected systems.  Furthermore, the increasing reliance on cloud computing presents new vulnerabilities related to data breaches and supply chain compromises.  This presentation will analyze these challenges, focusing on the limitations of traditional security measures in addressing these modern threats.  It will then explore promising solutions, including advancements in blockchain technology for secure data management, the application of zero-trust security models, and the development of more sophisticated threat intelligence platforms leveraging AI and machine learning for predictive analysis and proactive defense.  Finally, the presentation will emphasize the critical need for collaborative efforts across industry, government, and academia to address this complex and rapidly evolving challenge.
