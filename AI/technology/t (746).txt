This presentation provides a concise overview of the rapidly evolving fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on their current applications and future potential.  We begin by defining core concepts, differentiating AI's broader scope from the data-driven methodologies of ML.  Key ML algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, will be introduced, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations across diverse domains.  The presentation will then explore prominent applications of AI/ML, such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics, illustrating their impact on various sectors, including healthcare, finance, and transportation.  Furthermore, we will address the ethical considerations surrounding AI/ML deployment, emphasizing issues of bias, fairness, transparency, and accountability. Finally, we will briefly discuss emerging trends, including explainable AI (XAI) and federated learning, and speculate on their potential to shape the future landscape of AI research and application.  The presentation aims to provide attendees with a foundational understanding of this transformative technology and its societal implications.
