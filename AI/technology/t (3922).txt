Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture addresses the experimental challenges inherent in researching Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.  While AI and ML offer transformative potential, their development is fraught with significant hurdles.  Firstly, data acquisition and quality pose considerable problems.  Sufficient, representative, and unbiased datasets are crucial for effective model training, yet obtaining such data is often expensive and time-consuming.  Bias within these datasets can lead to inaccurate and ethically problematic outcomes, demanding rigorous pre-processing and careful scrutiny.

Secondly, evaluating model performance remains a complex issue.  Standard metrics can be insufficient to capture the nuances of real-world applications, requiring the development of more context-specific and robust evaluation frameworks.  Furthermore, the 'black box' nature of many deep learning models hinders interpretability, making it difficult to understand their decision-making processes and identify potential flaws.  Addressing these experimental challenges is paramount to advancing AI and ML responsibly and ensuring the reliable deployment of these powerful technologies.
