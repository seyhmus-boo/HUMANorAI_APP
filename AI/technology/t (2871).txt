While seemingly unrelated, the rise of autonomous vehicles is subtly underpinned by quantum mechanical principles.  The computational power required for real-time processing of sensor data – crucial for navigation and obstacle avoidance – relies heavily on semiconductor technology.  Miniaturization of transistors, governed by quantum mechanical effects like electron tunneling and band gap engineering, allows for the staggering processing speeds necessary for autonomous driving algorithms.  Furthermore, the development of advanced LiDAR systems, crucial for environmental perception, relies on the quantum nature of light.  Precise measurements of distance and object properties are achieved by exploiting the wave-particle duality of photons and leveraging the principles of quantum electrodynamics.  Finally, advancements in artificial intelligence, powering the decision-making processes within these vehicles, increasingly incorporate quantum computing algorithms to improve efficiency in complex problem-solving, although this remains a nascent field.  Therefore, while not directly employing quantum computing in their current iteration, autonomous vehicles owe their existence to the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, shaping their underlying technological foundation.
