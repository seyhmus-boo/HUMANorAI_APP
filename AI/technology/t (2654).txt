Cloud computing, once a nascent technological frontier, has rapidly evolved into a ubiquitous paradigm shift in information technology.  This presentation traces its evolution, employing accessible analogies to illustrate key transitions.  Initially, cloud computing resembled a shared, centralized mainframe—a single, powerful resource accessible to many. This “utility computing” model, analogous to a municipal water supply, provided basic services on demand.  However, the increasing need for customization and specialized functionalities led to the rise of “private clouds,” akin to a private well, offering greater control but reduced scalability.

The subsequent emergence of hybrid clouds, blending public and private resources, mirrors the development of sophisticated irrigation systems, integrating both centralized reservoirs and localized wells. This hybrid approach addresses the limitations of solely relying on a single model. Finally, the advent of serverless computing represents a paradigm shift, analogous to outsourcing individual tasks to specialized contractors, rather than managing an entire workforce (servers). This model further enhances efficiency and scalability, allowing for more agile and cost-effective deployment of applications.  The presentation concludes by exploring future trends and challenges in this dynamic landscape.
