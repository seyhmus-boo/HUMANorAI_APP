The rapid proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological and societal shift, demanding rigorous investigation into its multifaceted implications.  This research paper examines the accelerating rise of AVs, focusing on recent developments that are shaping their trajectory from nascent technology to potentially ubiquitous transportation.  While early research primarily concentrated on technological hurdles such as sensor fusion and path planning, the focus has broadened considerably.  Recent years have witnessed significant advancements in artificial intelligence, particularly in deep learning and reinforcement learning algorithms, leading to improved object recognition, decision-making capabilities, and robust navigation in complex, dynamic environments.  Furthermore, regulatory frameworks are evolving rapidly, with differing approaches adopted across jurisdictions, influencing the pace and scope of AV deployment.  This paper will analyse these pivotal developments, examining the interplay between technological progress, regulatory landscapes, and societal acceptance in shaping the future of autonomous driving.  Specifically, we will investigate the impact of advancements in high-definition mapping, edge computing, and cybersecurity on the overall feasibility and safety of AV technology.
