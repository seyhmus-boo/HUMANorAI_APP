The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a paradigm shift in transportation, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to address its multifaceted implications.  This presentation explores the complex interplay of disciplines shaping the development and societal impact of AVs.  We examine the engineering challenges, encompassing advancements in sensor fusion, machine learning algorithms, and robust control systems crucial for safe and efficient navigation.  Further, the legal and ethical dimensions are highlighted, analyzing liability frameworks, data privacy concerns, and the potential for algorithmic bias in decision-making processes.  Economic aspects are considered, focusing on the disruptive potential for employment in transportation sectors and the emerging business models within the AV industry.  Finally,  we investigate the socio-cultural impacts, encompassing changes in urban planning, accessibility for vulnerable populations, and the potential transformation of social interaction facilitated by in-vehicle technology.  By examining these interconnected domains, the presentation underscores the need for collaborative efforts across engineering, law, economics, and social sciences to navigate the challenges and harness the opportunities presented by the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles.
