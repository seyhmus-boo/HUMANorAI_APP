The advent of quantum computing presents both profound challenges and potential solutions to cybersecurity.  Current cryptographic systems, reliant on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers (RSA) or the discrete logarithm problem (ECC), become vulnerable to Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm capable of efficiently solving these problems. This poses an existential threat to data confidentiality and integrity across numerous sectors.  The challenge lies in developing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms resistant to attacks from both classical and quantum computers.  

Several PQC approaches are under investigation, including lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, and multivariate cryptography.  These leverage the inherent mathematical hardness of problems believed to remain intractable even for quantum computers.  However, implementing PQC presents challenges related to key size, computational overhead, and algorithm standardization.  Furthermore, the potential for quantum key distribution (QKD), leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to establish secure keys, offers a promising avenue for unconditionally secure communication. Despite significant advancements, QKD faces obstacles including limited transmission distance and vulnerability to side-channel attacks.  Ultimately, a holistic approach encompassing PQC, QKD, and robust quantum-resistant hardware is required to navigate the evolving quantum cybersecurity landscape.
