Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct concepts.  AI, in its broadest sense, encompasses the creation of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Imagine AI as a vast, ambitious blueprint for building intelligent machines â€“ a blueprint that encompasses numerous potential approaches.  Machine learning, conversely, is a specific subset of AI techniques. It focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Think of it as a specific tool within the AI toolbox.  Instead of explicitly instructing a computer how to identify a cat in an image, ML algorithms analyze thousands of labelled images, identifying patterns and features that distinguish cats from other objects. This process is analogous to a child learning to identify a cat through repeated exposure and observation rather than receiving a detailed, pre-defined description.  Consequently, ML empowers AI systems to adapt and improve their performance over time, much like a human learning and refining their skills through experience. The relationship can be visualized as concentric circles, with ML forming a core component within the larger domain of AI.
