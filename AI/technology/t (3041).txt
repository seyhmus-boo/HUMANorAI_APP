Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).  Think of VR as completely immersing yourself in a computer-generated world – akin to stepping into a meticulously crafted dream.  Your physical reality is effectively replaced by a simulated one, mediated through headsets and haptic feedback devices.  Applications range from immersive gaming experiences to architectural walkthroughs, offering unparalleled levels of engagement.

Conversely, AR overlays digital information onto the real world. Imagine looking through a window; AR is like having annotations, extra details, or interactive elements digitally added to the view.  Think Pokémon Go, where digital creatures appear superimposed on your real-world surroundings via your smartphone's camera.  Similarly, AR in surgery can project anatomical data onto a patient, assisting precision.  Thus, VR replaces reality, while AR enhances it. Both technologies, however, share a reliance on powerful computing and sophisticated sensor technologies, driving innovative developments across numerous sectors.
