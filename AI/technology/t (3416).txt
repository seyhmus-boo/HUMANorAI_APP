Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields.  AI, the broader concept, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception or decision-making.  Imagine AI as the overarching blueprint for a self-driving car – the goal is autonomous navigation.  ML, a subset of AI, provides the mechanism for achieving this.  Instead of explicitly programming every driving scenario, ML algorithms allow the system to learn from data.  Think of it as teaching the car to drive by showing it countless examples of road situations and rewarding correct responses – a process akin to training a dog with treats.

Deep learning, a further specialization within ML, utilizes artificial neural networks with multiple layers to analyze complex data.  This is analogous to the human brain's layered processing of information.  While simple ML might learn a straightforward pattern like identifying handwritten digits, deep learning can tackle intricate tasks like image recognition or natural language processing, mirroring the human brain's ability to understand nuances and context.  Therefore,  AI sets the ambitious goal of replicating human intelligence, while ML, particularly deep learning, provides the powerful statistical tools to achieve increasingly sophisticated approximations of that goal through learning from experience, rather than explicit programming.
