Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the creation of intelligent agents, systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Its conceptual origins trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, marking a pivotal moment in its formalization. Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, achieving limited success.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data, adapting their performance over time. This paradigm shift, driven by increased computational power and data availability, has propelled AI forward.  Early ML methods like decision trees and naive Bayes gave way to more sophisticated techniques, including support vector machines and neural networks, the latter experiencing a resurgence with the advent of deep learning.  The relationship is thus hierarchical: ML provides a powerful toolset for achieving AI's overarching goal of creating intelligent systems, though AI encompasses broader approaches beyond data-driven learning.
