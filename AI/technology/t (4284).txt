Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct but related technological advancements impacting numerous fields.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  This allows for practical applications such as interactive product visualization in retail, overlaying real-time data in medical procedures (e.g., displaying patient vitals during surgery), or enriching historical site tours with contextual information.

Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, creating a sense of presence through head-mounted displays.  This technology finds applications in areas like training and simulation, offering realistic scenarios for pilots, surgeons, or military personnel without real-world risks.  Furthermore, VR is increasingly utilized in therapeutic contexts, addressing phobias or providing immersive rehabilitation experiences.  Both AR and VR share the potential for transformative educational experiences, offering interactive and engaging learning environments across diverse disciplines.  However, technological limitations, including cost and user accessibility, remain ongoing challenges to their widespread adoption.
