Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly transforming various sectors, from entertainment and healthcare to education and manufacturing.  Despite their burgeoning potential, the widespread adoption and full realization of their capabilities are hampered by significant experimental challenges. This paper explores these key obstacles hindering the development and effective application of AR and VR systems.  We focus particularly on the methodological difficulties inherent in rigorously evaluating user experience, including issues of ecological validity and the subjective nature of immersion.  Furthermore, the technical challenges associated with creating realistic and responsive environments, managing computational demands within wearable devices, and addressing issues of motion sickness and simulator sickness are examined.  Finally, we consider the ethical implications of increasingly realistic and immersive experiences, such as the potential for biases in data collection and the impact on user wellbeing. This analysis aims to highlight critical areas for future research, ultimately contributing towards the development of more robust, effective, and ethically sound AR and VR applications.
