Good morning. Today's lecture examines the evolution of cloud computing and the persistent experimental challenges it presents.  Initially, cloud computing emerged from distributed computing concepts, offering on-demand resource provisioning. Early implementations faced significant hurdles, notably in achieving robust fault tolerance and ensuring data security across geographically dispersed systems.  Experiments with virtualisation technologies, while transformative, presented challenges in resource allocation efficiency and the management of complex virtual machine interactions.

The shift towards massive scale, inherent in today's cloud infrastructures, introduced further complexities.  Experimental research continues to address scalability limitations, specifically in network latency and data transfer speeds.  Moreover, the energy consumption of vast data centres remains a critical concern, demanding innovative energy-efficient designs and experimental investigations into cooling technologies and power management strategies.  Finally, the evolving landscape of cyber threats necessitates ongoing research into robust security protocols and resilient system architectures, posing ongoing experimental challenges for the field.
