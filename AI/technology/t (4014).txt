Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, transitioning from niche applications to pervasive tools with transformative potential across diverse sectors.  Recent years have witnessed significant advancements driving this transition, including the proliferation of affordable and accessible hardware such as lightweight VR headsets and increasingly sophisticated smartphone-based AR applications.  This paper explores the burgeoning landscape of AR and VR applications, focusing on recent technological developments and their implications.  Specifically, we examine the integration of advanced tracking systems, enabling more precise and immersive experiences, and the rise of haptic feedback technologies, enhancing user interaction and realism.  Furthermore, the paper investigates the increasing sophistication of rendering techniques, leading to higher fidelity visuals and more believable virtual environments.  We also analyse the expansion of AR and VR applications beyond entertainment, encompassing significant developments in areas such as medical training, engineering design, and remote collaboration.  This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art and to identify emerging trends shaping the future of AR and VR technologies.
