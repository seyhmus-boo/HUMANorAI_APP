The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to revolutionize domestic life through the creation of smart homes, seamlessly integrating everyday appliances and devices into a networked ecosystem controlled via intuitive interfaces.  While the conceptual framework for smart homes is well-established, the practical implementation and experimental validation of IoT-based systems present significant challenges. This paper focuses on these experimental hurdles, arguing that the complexity inherent in IoT environments hinders robust and reproducible research.  Specifically, we examine the difficulties in establishing controlled experimental conditions, accounting for the inherent heterogeneity of IoT devices and their communication protocols, and mitigating the influence of external factors such as network instability and user variability.  Furthermore, we address the ethical considerations involved in data collection and privacy within these interconnected domestic settings, which are crucial for ensuring the responsible development and testing of smart home technologies. This investigation aims to identify key limitations in current experimental methodologies and propose potential strategies for improving the rigor and reproducibility of future research in this rapidly evolving field.
