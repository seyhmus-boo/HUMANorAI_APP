Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This learning occurs through algorithms that identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time based on new data.  Different ML approaches exist, including supervised learning (using labeled data), unsupervised learning (identifying patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).

Practical applications of AI and ML are pervasive.  In healthcare, ML algorithms diagnose diseases from medical images and predict patient outcomes.  Finance leverages AI for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on AI for object recognition and navigation.  Natural language processing (NLP), an AI subfield utilizing ML, powers chatbots and language translation services. The continued advancement of AI and ML promises further transformative impacts across diverse sectors, necessitating careful consideration of ethical implications alongside technological progress.
