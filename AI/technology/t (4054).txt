The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a paradigm shift in transportation, demanding a multifaceted approach transcending traditional engineering boundaries. This presentation explores the crucial interdisciplinary links driving AV development and deployment.  We will examine the synergistic interplay between computer science, focusing on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision for perception and decision-making; mechanical engineering, crucial for vehicle design, sensor integration, and robust control systems; and electrical engineering, vital for power management, communication networks (V2X), and sensor data processing.  Furthermore, the societal implications necessitate engagement with legal and ethical scholarship, addressing liability, data privacy, and equitable access.  Economic considerations, encompassing market analysis, infrastructure investment, and job displacement, also form a critical component.  This presentation argues that successful AV implementation hinges on effective collaboration across these disciplines, requiring not only technological advancements but also proactive consideration of the broader societal, legal, and economic ramifications.  We conclude by highlighting avenues for future interdisciplinary research to overcome existing challenges and realize the full potential of AV technology.
