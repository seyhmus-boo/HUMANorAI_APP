Good morning. Today's lecture will explore the interconnected fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making. Its conceptual roots lie in the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, considered the birth of the field.  Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, achieving limited success due to computational constraints.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a more practical approach. Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data.  This paradigm shift, fuelled by increasing computing power and data availability, has led to the current AI boom.  Supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning constitute the major ML paradigms, each employing distinct techniques to extract knowledge and make predictions.  While AI sets the overarching goal of intelligent systems, ML provides the crucial methodology for achieving it, driving advancements in diverse areas including healthcare, finance, and autonomous systems.  The interplay between these fields continues to evolve rapidly, shaping the technological landscape of the 21st century.
