This presentation examines the multifaceted cybersecurity landscape, highlighting the critical need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address emerging threats and develop robust solutions.  The increasing sophistication of cyberattacks necessitates a move beyond purely technical approaches, encompassing social, legal, and economic dimensions.  We will explore the challenges posed by the interconnected nature of modern systems, including the vulnerabilities inherent in the Internet of Things (IoT) and the rise of AI-driven attacks.  The presentation will analyze how human factors, such as social engineering and phishing, represent significant weaknesses exploitable by malicious actors.  Furthermore, the legal frameworks surrounding cybersecurity, including data privacy regulations and international cooperation, will be discussed as crucial components of a comprehensive strategy.  Finally, we will illustrate the potential of interdisciplinary solutions, such as the integration of behavioral science in security awareness training and the application of game theory in cybersecurity strategy development.  This interdisciplinary approach is vital for creating effective, resilient, and adaptable cybersecurity measures in a constantly evolving digital world.
