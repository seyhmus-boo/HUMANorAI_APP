The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) marks a significant technological leap, promising transformative impacts on transportation, logistics, and urban planning. While conventionally analyzed through the lens of computer science, engineering, and societal implications, this research explores the burgeoning intersection of quantum mechanics and the rise of AVs.  This seemingly disparate connection arises from the crucial role of advanced sensor technologies underpinning autonomous navigation.  LiDAR, radar, and camera systems, essential for environmental perception in AVs, rely fundamentally on the interaction of photons and electrons with matterâ€”processes governed by quantum mechanics.  The precision and sensitivity of these sensors, vital for safe and reliable autonomous operation, are intrinsically limited by quantum noise and uncertainty.  Therefore, understanding the quantum mechanical underpinnings of these sensors is crucial for advancing the capabilities and safety of AVs. This paper investigates the limitations imposed by quantum noise on sensor performance, explores the potential of quantum technologies like quantum sensing and computation to improve AV systems, and ultimately examines the implications of these quantum-enhanced capabilities for the future development and widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles.
