The Internet of Things (IoT) promises to revolutionize domestic life through the creation of smart homes, integrating various devices and appliances into a cohesive, interconnected network.  While the potential benefits – enhanced energy efficiency, improved security, and increased convenience – are significant, realizing this vision faces considerable experimental challenges. This paper examines the key hurdles hindering the effective research and development of IoT-enabled smart home systems.  Specifically, we address the complexities of establishing robust and secure interoperability between heterogeneous devices, the inherent limitations of existing communication protocols in handling the high volume and variety of data generated by smart home environments, and the challenges associated with data privacy and security in these interconnected systems.  Furthermore, we will explore the methodological difficulties in conducting rigorous experimental evaluations, considering factors such as the inherent variability in user behaviour and the significant complexity in replicating real-world living scenarios within a controlled laboratory setting.  Ultimately, this research aims to highlight critical areas requiring further investigation to accelerate the development and deployment of truly effective and reliable smart home technologies.
