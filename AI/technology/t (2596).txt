Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, while experiencing a surge in popularity, possess a rich history rooted in early computer graphics and simulation efforts.  From Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957), considered a precursor to VR headsets, to Ivan Sutherland's "The Sword of Damocles" (1968), a pioneering head-mounted display system, the foundational concepts were established decades ago.  However, limitations in computing power and display technology restricted their widespread adoption. Recent advancements in processing power, miniaturization of sensors, and improved display resolution have fueled a resurgence, leading to diverse applications across numerous fields.  AR applications, overlaying digital information onto the real world, are increasingly utilized in navigation, industrial maintenance, and medical training, enhancing situational awareness and efficiency.  VR, generating immersive synthetic environments, finds application in gaming, architectural visualization, therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD, and complex surgical simulations, providing unparalleled interactive experiences.  This abstract highlights the historical progression and current diverse applications of AR and VR, emphasizing their potential to revolutionize various aspects of human interaction and technological advancement.  Future research should focus on addressing challenges related to user experience, accessibility, and the ethical implications of increasingly realistic and immersive environments.
