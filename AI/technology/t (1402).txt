Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related technological advancements impacting numerous sectors. AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones or smart glasses.  This allows for practical applications such as interactive product visualization in retail,  improved surgical planning through overlaying medical scans onto a patient, and enhanced training simulations in fields demanding high-stakes performance, like aviation or surgery.

Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, creating a sense of presence through headsets and haptic feedback. This enables realistic training scenarios for dangerous professions (e.g., firefighting), immersive gaming experiences, and therapeutic applications addressing phobias or PTSD through exposure therapy.  While distinct, AR and VR technologies increasingly converge, creating mixed reality (MR) experiences that blend real and virtual worlds seamlessly.  The potential applications of these technologies are vast and continue to evolve, driving innovation across diverse fields.
