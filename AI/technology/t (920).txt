This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, examining their practical implications across diverse sectors.  While often conflated, AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing existing environments, while VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments.  We will discuss the distinct characteristics and capabilities of each technology, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations.

Practical applications will be a central focus.  In healthcare, AR assists surgeons with real-time anatomical data overlays, while VR facilitates therapeutic exposure for phobias and pain management.  In education, immersive VR environments offer engaging learning experiences across various disciplines, exceeding the limitations of traditional classroom settings.  Similarly, AR applications are transforming industrial training, providing interactive simulations for complex machinery operation.  Furthermore, we will touch upon the rising use of AR and VR in retail, allowing consumers to virtually try on clothes or visualize furniture in their homes, and in architecture and design for collaborative project visualization and client presentations.  The presentation concludes with a discussion of current challenges and future trends in AR/VR development and deployment.
