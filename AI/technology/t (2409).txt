This presentation explores the convergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart home technology, examining its historical evolution and current implications.  Early examples of automated home systems, dating back to the mid-20th century, laid the groundwork for today's sophisticated interconnected devices. However, the widespread adoption of IoT, characterized by the proliferation of inexpensive sensors, microcontrollers, and ubiquitous internet connectivity, has dramatically accelerated smart home development.  This presentation will analyze the key technological advancements that facilitated this transition, focusing on improvements in communication protocols (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi) and data processing capabilities. We will further discuss the diverse applications within smart homes, including energy management, security systems, and automated appliances, highlighting both the benefits – increased convenience, energy efficiency, and enhanced security – and the challenges – data privacy concerns, security vulnerabilities, and interoperability issues.  Finally, the presentation will briefly address future trends in the field, particularly the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning to create truly autonomous and personalized smart home environments.
