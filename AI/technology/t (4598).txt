Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct but related technological advancements with growing applications across numerous sectors.  VR, with roots in early flight simulators and immersive head-mounted displays from the 1960s, aims to create entirely synthetic, computer-generated environments that replace the user's perception of reality.  Early VR systems, hampered by limited processing power and display resolution, struggled to achieve widespread adoption.  Conversely, AR, which overlays digital information onto the real world, emerged more gradually, finding initial use in military and industrial applications.  The development of smartphones and increasingly powerful mobile processors, however, has fueled a surge in both AR and VR adoption.  Currently, AR applications range from interactive gaming and retail experiences (e.g., virtual try-ons) to medical training simulations and architectural visualization.  VR, meanwhile, has found success in gaming, entertainment, and therapeutic applications such as exposure therapy for phobias.  Future advancements will likely focus on improving the fidelity and accessibility of these technologies, blurring the lines between the physical and digital realms even further, leading to potentially transformative impacts across diverse disciplines.
