This presentation explores the burgeoning field of blockchain technology and its multifaceted applications across diverse disciplines.  Beyond its initial association with cryptocurrencies, blockchain's decentralized, transparent, and secure architecture offers transformative potential in various sectors.  We will examine the interdisciplinary links facilitating this expansion, focusing on collaborations between computer science, law, economics, and social sciences.  The inherent immutability of blockchain data offers significant implications for legal frameworks concerning provenance and intellectual property rights, a topic requiring interdisciplinary analysis of technological capabilities and legal interpretations.  Economically, blockchain's potential to streamline supply chains, enhance microfinance accessibility, and foster new forms of decentralized governance will be discussed, highlighting the need for economic modelling and impact assessments.  Finally, we will consider the societal implications, encompassing data privacy concerns, regulatory challenges, and the ethical considerations surrounding the decentralized nature of the technology.  This presentation aims to provide a broad overview of blockchain's potential, emphasizing the critical role of interdisciplinary research in navigating its complexities and maximizing its benefits responsibly.
