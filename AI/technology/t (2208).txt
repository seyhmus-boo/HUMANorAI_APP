This review examines the rapidly evolving fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), highlighting their key concepts, applications, and limitations.  AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating intelligent agents, leverages ML algorithms – particularly deep learning – to achieve increasingly sophisticated tasks.  The review explores various ML techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, analyzing their strengths and weaknesses across diverse domains.  Significant advancements in computational power and data availability have fueled remarkable progress in areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and robotics.  However, challenges remain, including issues of data bias, algorithmic transparency (explainability), and ethical considerations surrounding autonomous systems.  This review concludes that while AI and ML offer transformative potential across numerous sectors, addressing these limitations is crucial for responsible and beneficial deployment. Future research should prioritize developing robust, ethical, and explainable AI systems to maximize societal benefit and mitigate potential risks.
