Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct concepts.  AI, in its broadest sense, encompasses the creation of intelligent agents, systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. Think of AI as the overarching goal – building a machine that can "think."  Machine learning, however, is a specific approach to achieving this goal.  Instead of explicitly programming every rule and action, ML utilizes algorithms that allow systems to learn from data.  Imagine teaching a child to identify cats:  you wouldn't list every possible cat characteristic; instead, you'd show them numerous examples, allowing them to discern patterns and features independently.  Similarly, ML algorithms are trained on vast datasets, identifying patterns and relationships that enable them to make predictions or decisions without explicit programming.  Thus, ML acts as a powerful tool within the broader field of AI, providing a means to build intelligent systems that can adapt and improve their performance over time, much like a child’s understanding of cats grows with experience. Deep learning, a subfield of ML utilizing artificial neural networks, further refines this approach, mimicking the complex interconnectedness of the human brain to achieve even more sophisticated learning capabilities.
