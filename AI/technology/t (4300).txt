Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet interconnected paradigms in human-computer interaction, leveraging digital information to enhance or replace perceived reality.  AR, akin to adding digital annotations to a physical map, overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real world, enriching user experience. Think of Pok√©mon Go, where virtual creatures appear superimposed on the user's real-world view through their smartphone screen.  This overlays contextual information, enhancing understanding and facilitating tasks like navigation or interactive maintenance manuals.

Conversely, VR, analogous to stepping inside a completely simulated environment, immerses users in entirely computer-generated worlds.  Imagine experiencing a historical battle through a VR headset, fully engaging your senses within a realistic, interactive reconstruction.  This complete immersion finds applications in training simulations, for example, allowing surgeons to practice complex procedures without risk, or in therapeutic contexts, enabling exposure therapy for phobias.

While distinct, AR and VR applications increasingly converge.  For instance, "mixed reality" systems blend real and virtual environments more seamlessly, allowing for interactive manipulation of virtual objects within a real-world setting, comparable to seamlessly integrating digital models into a physical design process.  The future trajectory suggests an ever-increasing integration of these technologies, blurring the lines between the physical and digital realms.
