This presentation explores the rapidly evolving landscape of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, focusing on recent key developments and their implications across diverse sectors.  While initially limited to gaming and entertainment, AR/VR technologies are increasingly impacting fields such as healthcare, education, and engineering.  Recent advancements in hardware, including lighter and more affordable headsets, along with improvements in processing power and haptic feedback, have driven wider adoption and enhanced user experience.  We will examine the rise of cloud-based AR/VR platforms, allowing for greater accessibility and scalability, and discuss the increasing sophistication of user interfaces, enabling more intuitive and immersive interactions. Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the emerging role of AI in AR/VR, particularly in areas such as real-time object recognition, environmental mapping, and personalized content generation. Finally, we will briefly address the ethical considerations associated with this burgeoning technology, including concerns about data privacy, accessibility, and the potential for misuse.  The presentation aims to provide an overview of the current state-of-the-art and potential future trajectories of AR/VR applications.
