The burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are not solely the domain of computer science; their development and application represent a significant convergence of multiple disciplines.  Computer graphics and human-computer interaction (HCI) are foundational, providing the technological infrastructure for realistic rendering and intuitive user interfaces.  However, psychology plays a crucial role in understanding user experience, including issues of presence, cybersickness, and the cognitive load imposed by immersive environments.  Furthermore, design thinking principles are vital for creating user-friendly and effective applications, considering aspects of ergonomics, aesthetics, and accessibility.  Beyond these core areas, AR/VR applications are increasingly impacting fields like medicine (surgical simulations, rehabilitation), education (interactive learning environments), engineering (design visualization and prototyping), and marketing (immersive product demonstrations).  The interdisciplinary nature of AR/VR necessitates collaborations between computer scientists, psychologists, designers, and domain experts, ensuring the development of robust, impactful, and ethically sound technologies.  The ongoing evolution of these technologies necessitates continued interdisciplinary research to address emerging challenges and explore new possibilities.
