Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and their diverse applications.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception, while VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments.

Practically, AR finds applications in numerous sectors.  In healthcare, AR facilitates surgical planning and assists with complex procedures through real-time overlaying of patient data.  In manufacturing, AR guides technicians through assembly processes, reducing errors and improving efficiency. Similarly, retail utilizes AR for virtual try-ons of clothing and furniture, enhancing the customer experience.

VR, conversely, boasts applications in training simulations.  Pilots, surgeons, and even soldiers utilize VR for realistic practice scenarios, improving skills in a risk-free environment.  In entertainment, VR provides immersive gaming experiences and virtual tourism opportunities.  Furthermore, therapeutic applications exist, using VR for exposure therapy in treating phobias and anxiety disorders.  The continued development and refinement of these technologies promise even greater integration across various disciplines in the coming years.
