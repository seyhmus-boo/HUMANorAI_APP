Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI encompasses the broader goal of creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and problem-solving. ML, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This learning occurs through algorithms that identify patterns, make predictions, and improve performance over time based on the data they are exposed to.

Crucially,  ML algorithms are categorized into supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning approaches, each suited to different tasks. Supervised learning uses labelled data to train models for tasks like image classification and spam filtering. Unsupervised learning, conversely, analyzes unlabeled data to uncover hidden structures and patterns, as seen in clustering algorithms for customer segmentation. Reinforcement learning involves agents interacting with an environment, learning optimal strategies through trial and error, exemplified by applications in robotics and game playing.

Practical applications of AI and ML are ubiquitous.  In healthcare, ML algorithms diagnose diseases from medical images with increasing accuracy.  Finance utilizes AI for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on ML for navigation and object recognition.  The continued development and refinement of these technologies promise significant advancements across diverse sectors, though ethical considerations surrounding bias, transparency, and accountability remain paramount.
