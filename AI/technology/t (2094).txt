Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are rapidly evolving technologies with significant interdisciplinary implications.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing perception, while VR creates fully immersive simulated environments.  Their applications span diverse fields.  Computer science forms the technological bedrock, encompassing areas like 3D modelling, rendering, and human-computer interaction.  Psychology plays a crucial role in understanding user experience, cognitive load, and the impact of immersion on behaviour.  Design, encompassing industrial and user interface design, shapes the usability and aesthetic appeal of AR/VR systems.  Furthermore, fields like medicine benefit from surgical simulations (VR), while education employs AR for interactive learning environments.  Marketing and entertainment industries are early adopters, creating immersive experiences for consumers.  The convergence of these disciplines is crucial for developing effective and ethically sound AR/VR systems, addressing challenges related to user safety, accessibility, and the potential for misuse.  Future research demands a continued interdisciplinary approach to unlock the full potential of these powerful technologies.
