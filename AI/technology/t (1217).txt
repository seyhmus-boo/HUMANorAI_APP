Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the burgeoning fields of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) and their diverse applications.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing our perception of reality.  Consider its use in navigation apps displaying directional overlays on a phone's camera view, or in medical training where surgeons can practice complex procedures on virtual anatomical models superimposed onto a real patient.

Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely computer-generated environments.  This technology finds significant use in gaming, creating highly engaging and interactive experiences.  Beyond entertainment, VR is revolutionizing fields like architecture, allowing clients to virtually walk through building designs, and therapy, providing exposure therapy for phobias in controlled virtual settings.  The convergence of AR and VR, termed Mixed Reality, further expands possibilities, creating environments where digital and physical elements interact seamlessly.  Ultimately, the practical applications of AR and VR are vast and continue to expand across numerous sectors, promising transformative impacts on our lives.
