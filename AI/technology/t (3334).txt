Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), while often used interchangeably, represent distinct yet interconnected fields.  AI, conceived in the mid-20th century with early efforts focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, aims to create machines capable of intelligent behaviour.  Initial optimism was tempered by limitations in computational power and algorithmic sophistication, leading to periods of reduced funding and interest ("AI winters").

The resurgence of AI, beginning in the late 2000s, is largely attributed to advancements in ML, particularly deep learning.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on algorithms allowing systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Deep learning leverages artificial neural networks with multiple layers to extract complex patterns from vast datasets.  This has resulted in significant breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and other areas.

However, ethical concerns regarding bias in algorithms, data privacy, and the potential for job displacement necessitate careful consideration.  Further research is needed to address explainability in complex models, ensuring transparency and accountability.  Despite ongoing challenges, AI and ML represent transformative technologies with the potential to revolutionise numerous sectors, promising both substantial benefits and considerable ethical complexities.
