The future of quantum computing hinges on overcoming several fundamental quantum mechanical challenges.  Scalability remains a paramount concern; maintaining quantum coherence across a large number of qubits is crucial for complex computations, yet susceptible to decoherence from environmental interactions.  Developing robust error correction codes, leveraging principles of quantum error correction, is therefore paramount.  This necessitates deeper understanding of decoherence mechanisms and the development of more resilient qubit platforms, potentially exploiting topological protection or novel qubit architectures beyond superconducting or trapped ion systems.

Further progress demands advanced quantum algorithms surpassing classical counterparts.  While Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm demonstrate potential, the discovery and refinement of algorithms applicable to broader computational problems are crucial for realizing the transformative power of quantum computers.  This theoretical development necessitates exploring the nuances of quantum entanglement and its exploitation for efficient computation, potentially involving advancements in quantum complexity theory.  Ultimately, the future of quantum computing is inextricably linked to bridging the gap between theoretical breakthroughs and practical engineering solutions to mitigate quantum mechanical limitations.
