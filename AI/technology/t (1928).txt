The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological leap, yet its underlying physics often remains implicitly classical.  This abstract explores the potential relevance of quantum mechanics to future AV development, focusing on three key areas. Firstly, quantum sensing technologies, such as atom interferometers and superconducting quantum interference devices (SQUIDs), offer the potential for dramatically improved navigation and obstacle detection capabilities, surpassing the limitations of current LiDAR and radar systems in terms of precision and robustness. Secondly, quantum computing could revolutionize the processing of sensor data and path planning algorithms, enabling real-time optimization of complex driving scenarios and potentially leading to safer and more efficient traffic flow.  Finally, the development of quantum-enhanced communication networks is crucial for enabling reliable vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, which is essential for the safe and effective operation of large-scale AV deployments. While significant challenges remain in scaling and integrating these quantum technologies, their potential transformative impact on AV safety, efficiency, and overall societal impact warrants further investigation into their fundamental feasibility and practical implementation.  The future of AVs may be inextricably linked to the advancements in the quantum realm.
