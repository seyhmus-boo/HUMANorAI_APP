The proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) marks a significant technological and societal shift, driven by converging advancements in artificial intelligence, sensor technology, and computing power.  Early research focused on rule-based systems, navigating pre-programmed environments. However, the field has rapidly transitioned towards machine learning algorithms, particularly deep learning, enabling AVs to perceive and interpret complex, dynamic environments with increased accuracy and adaptability.  This progress has been facilitated by the exponential growth in data availability, allowing for the training of sophisticated models capable of object detection, classification, and trajectory prediction.  Nevertheless, challenges remain.  Ensuring functional safety and addressing ethical dilemmas surrounding accident liability and decision-making in unpredictable situations necessitate robust regulatory frameworks and ongoing research into explainable AI and verifiable safety mechanisms.  Furthermore, the societal impact, including job displacement and infrastructure adaptation, necessitates proactive planning and mitigation strategies.  Future research will likely focus on improving robustness, addressing edge cases, and integrating AVs seamlessly into existing transportation systems.
