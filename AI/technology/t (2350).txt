The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology presents significant experimental challenges hindering its widespread deployment. This presentation examines key experimental hurdles in realizing fully autonomous driving.  We focus on three primary areas:  robust perception in diverse and unpredictable environments, the development of safe and reliable decision-making algorithms capable of handling edge cases and unforeseen circumstances, and the ethical implications inherent in algorithm design and validation.  The inherent difficulty in replicating the complexity and variability of real-world driving scenarios within controlled experimental settings will be discussed. We highlight the need for advanced simulation techniques and rigorous testing methodologies, including the integration of human-in-the-loop evaluations, to address the challenges posed by factors like adverse weather, unexpected pedestrian behavior, and malfunctioning vehicle components.  Furthermore, the ethical dilemma of defining acceptable risk levels and establishing liability frameworks in the context of AV accidents will be explored.  Finally, the presentation concludes by outlining prospective solutions and future research directions for overcoming these experimental barriers to realizing the full potential of AV technology.
