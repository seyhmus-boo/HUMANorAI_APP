Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related advancements in human-computer interaction, offering immersive experiences through digital augmentation of reality.  AR, akin to adding digital annotations to a physical map, overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real world.  Think of a smartphone app displaying furniture placement within a user's living room before purchase; the physical room remains, but digital objects are superimposed for contextual understanding.  Conversely, VR, analogous to stepping entirely into a simulated world, creates fully immersive artificial environments.  Imagine a flight simulator; the user is completely enveloped in a virtual cockpit, receiving sensory input simulating a real flight experience.  Both AR and VR applications span various sectors.  AR finds utility in training (e.g., surgical simulations), retail (e.g., virtual try-ons), and navigation, while VR excels in gaming, therapy (e.g., exposure therapy for phobias), and architectural design, allowing for realistic visualization and interaction within simulated spaces.  The core distinction lies in the degree of immersion: AR enhances reality, while VR replaces it.
