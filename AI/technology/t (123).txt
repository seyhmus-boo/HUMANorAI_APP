Quantum computing holds immense potential, but its transition from theoretical promise to practical application faces significant experimental hurdles. This presentation will explore key challenges hindering the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers.  We will examine the limitations of current qubit technologies, including superconducting transmon, trapped ions, and photonic systems, highlighting issues such as coherence times, gate fidelities, and scalability.  The critical need for improved qubit control and reduced noise will be discussed, emphasizing the ongoing research into advanced error correction codes and novel materials.  Furthermore, the significant engineering challenges associated with building and maintaining large-scale quantum computers, including cryogenic infrastructure and complex control systems, will be addressed.  Finally, we will briefly consider the path towards achieving fault tolerance and the potential role of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms in mitigating near-term limitations.  The presentation aims to provide a concise overview of the experimental roadblocks and current research directions shaping the future of quantum computing.
