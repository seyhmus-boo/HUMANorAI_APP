This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in developing and evaluating Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications.  While offering transformative potential across diverse sectors,  AR/VR research faces significant methodological hurdles.  We will discuss the complexities of conducting rigorous usability studies in immersive environments, highlighting issues such as simulator sickness, participant selection bias, and the difficulty in controlling extraneous variables.  Furthermore, the subjective nature of user experience in AR/VR necessitates careful consideration of data collection methods, including physiological measures (e.g., eye-tracking, heart rate variability) and qualitative techniques (e.g., interviews, think-aloud protocols).  The presentation will critically examine existing methodologies, focusing on limitations and potential biases.  We will also propose strategies for addressing these challenges, such as employing robust experimental designs, implementing appropriate counterbalancing techniques, and leveraging advanced data analysis methods to mitigate the impact of confounding factors.  Ultimately, this presentation aims to foster discussion on improving the rigor and reproducibility of research within the rapidly evolving field of AR/VR application development.
