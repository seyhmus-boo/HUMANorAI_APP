Cloud computing's evolution demonstrates a strong interdisciplinary nature, drawing from computer science, telecommunications, and economics.  Initially conceived as distributed computing models, its progression hinged on advancements in networking technologies (high-speed internet, fiber optics) enabling efficient data transfer and storage.  Computer science contributed through advancements in virtualization, allowing resource abstraction and efficient server utilization.  Database management systems, a cornerstone of computer science, were crucial for handling massive datasets in a scalable manner.

Economically, cloud computing disrupted traditional IT infrastructure models.  The shift to pay-as-you-go models, facilitated by advancements in accounting and billing systems, drastically altered cost structures for businesses, impacting fields such as operations research and management information systems.  Furthermore, the emergence of cloud-based services necessitates a consideration of legal and ethical frameworks, reflecting a growing interdisciplinary link with law and socio-technical studies, particularly regarding data privacy and security. This evolution continues with the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning, further intertwining cloud computing with disciplines like mathematics and statistics.
