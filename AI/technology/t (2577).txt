Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined yet distinct fields.  AI, broadly conceived, aims to create systems capable of intelligent behaviour, mimicking human cognitive functions like problem-solving and learning.  Think of AI as the overarching goal – building a "thinking machine."  ML, conversely, is a crucial subset of AI focusing on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  It's the engine powering many AI applications.  

Imagine a chef (AI) aiming to create a perfect soufflé.  Traditional programming would require meticulously detailing each step (explicit rules). ML, however, allows the chef to input numerous recipes and their outcomes (data).  The ML algorithm, akin to a sophisticated apprentice, analyzes this data, identifying patterns linking ingredient ratios and baking times to soufflé success (learning). This learned pattern allows the algorithm to predict the optimal recipe for a future soufflé, potentially surpassing the chef's initial knowledge.  Therefore, ML facilitates the acquisition of knowledge and skill within an AI system, enabling it to adapt and improve its performance over time, addressing complex problems beyond the scope of purely rule-based systems.  The continuous refinement of these ML models through feedback loops further enhances the sophistication and capabilities of the overarching AI system.
