Blockchain technology, initially conceived as the foundation for cryptocurrencies, has evolved into a versatile distributed ledger technology with far-reaching applications beyond finance. This presentation provides a concise overview of blockchain's core principles, focusing on its decentralized, transparent, and immutable nature.  We will explore how these characteristics underpin its suitability for a range of practical applications.

Specifically, we will examine its use in supply chain management, enabling enhanced traceability and transparency of goods from origin to consumer, thereby improving accountability and combating counterfeiting.  Further, its application in healthcare will be discussed, highlighting its potential to secure and manage sensitive patient data while facilitating interoperability between different healthcare providers.  Finally, the potential of blockchain in digital identity management will be explored, emphasizing its capacity to provide individuals with greater control over their personal information and reduce reliance on centralized authorities.  The presentation will conclude by briefly addressing the challenges and limitations of widespread blockchain adoption, including scalability and regulatory hurdles.
