The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) presents significant experimental challenges hindering widespread deployment.  Central to these is the problem of sensor fusion and data interpretation.  While LiDAR, radar, and cameras offer complementary data streams, robustly integrating these diverse modalities in real-time, especially in complex, unpredictable environments, remains problematic.  Edge cases, such as unexpected pedestrian behaviour or unmapped construction zones, continue to pose significant challenges for algorithms designed to navigate safely.  

Furthermore, achieving robust localization and mapping in dynamic environments necessitates advanced techniques that are computationally expensive and power-intensive.  The development of efficient and reliable algorithms for simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) remains a crucial area of research.  Ethical considerations further complicate experimentation; determining liability in accident scenarios involving AVs, and balancing safety with potentially overly cautious driving behaviours, requires rigorous ethical frameworks and extensive simulation testing.  Finally, the heterogeneity of road infrastructure across different regions necessitates significant adaptation and calibration of AV systems, highlighting the scalability challenges inherent in global deployment.
