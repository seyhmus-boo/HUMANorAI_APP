Augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, demonstrating significant interdisciplinary potential.  Their applications extend far beyond gaming and entertainment, showcasing strong links with fields like medicine, engineering, and education.  In medicine, AR facilitates surgical planning and training through the overlay of 3D models onto real-world anatomy, while VR provides immersive simulations for phobia treatment and pain management.  Engineering benefits from AR for design visualization and maintenance, allowing technicians to interact with complex machinery via digital overlays.  Similarly, VR enables realistic simulations in architectural design and urban planning.  Education leverages AR and VR for creating engaging and interactive learning experiences, offering immersive historical recreations, virtual field trips, and hands-on simulations in subjects ranging from chemistry to astrophysics.  The continued development of AR/VR hinges upon collaborative efforts across computer science, psychology, design, and the specific application domains themselves, highlighting its truly interdisciplinary nature.
