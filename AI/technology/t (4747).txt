Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly evolving, driven by advancements in computing power, display technologies, and sensor integration.  Recent developments in AR demonstrate a shift towards more sophisticated spatial computing, enabling seamless overlay of digital information onto the real world.  This is facilitated by improved depth sensing capabilities, allowing for more accurate placement of virtual objects and a richer interactive experience.  Applications are expanding beyond gaming and entertainment, finding utility in fields such as architecture and engineering (for virtual walkthroughs and design visualization), medical training (simulating surgical procedures), and retail (offering virtual try-on experiences).  Meanwhile, advancements in VR focus on enhancing immersion and realism through higher-resolution displays, improved haptic feedback systems, and increasingly sophisticated tracking technologies.  This leads to more compelling simulations, particularly in areas like aerospace training,  psychological therapy (exposure therapy for phobias), and collaborative design workflows, where geographically dispersed teams can interact in a shared virtual environment.  The convergence of AR and VR, leading to mixed reality experiences, is also gaining momentum, blurring the lines between the physical and digital worlds and opening up new possibilities for human-computer interaction.
