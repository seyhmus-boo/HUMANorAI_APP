This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of 5G networks on technological advancements across diverse disciplines.  Beyond its immediate role in enhancing mobile connectivity, 5G's low latency, high bandwidth, and massive connectivity capabilities are driving transformative changes.  We examine its interdisciplinary implications, focusing on key areas.  Firstly, its influence on the Internet of Things (IoT) is discussed, highlighting its crucial role in enabling the proliferation of smart devices and the subsequent data deluge necessitating advanced data analytics (Computer Science).  Secondly, we analyse the implications for healthcare, considering the potential of remote surgery and real-time patient monitoring facilitated by 5G's speed and reliability (Biomedicine & Engineering). Thirdly, the impact on manufacturing is explored, highlighting the potential for enhanced automation and real-time control systems in smart factories (Manufacturing Engineering & Industrial Automation).  Finally, we address the socio-economic consequences of 5G deployment, considering its impact on digital divides and the need for robust cybersecurity strategies (Sociology & Information Security). This interdisciplinary perspective underscores the pervasive influence of 5G, emphasizing the collaborative efforts required for its responsible development and deployment.  The presentation concludes by outlining future research directions at the intersection of these fields.
