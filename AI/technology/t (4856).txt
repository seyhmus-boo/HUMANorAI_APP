Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), while often used interchangeably, represent distinct yet interconnected fields.  AI, with roots in the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks requiring human intelligence.  Early approaches, employing symbolic reasoning and expert systems, yielded limited success beyond niche applications.  The resurgence of AI in recent decades is largely attributed to advancements in ML, specifically deep learning.

ML, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Its historical trajectory, influenced by early work in statistics and pattern recognition, experienced significant acceleration with the advent of increased computational power and the availability of massive datasets.  Algorithms such as support vector machines and neural networks, initially rudimentary, have become sophisticated tools for tasks ranging from image recognition and natural language processing to predictive analytics and robotics.  While ML has achieved remarkable progress, challenges remain, including addressing algorithmic bias, ensuring data security and privacy, and navigating the ethical implications of increasingly autonomous systems.  Future research will likely focus on improving explainability, robustness, and the generalizability of ML models.
