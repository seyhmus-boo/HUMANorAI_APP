Quantum computing, a paradigm shift in computation leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena, promises to revolutionize fields ranging from materials science to drug discovery.  However, the transition from theoretical advancements to practical, large-scale quantum computers faces significant experimental hurdles. This paper examines the key experimental challenges currently hindering the realization of fault-tolerant, scalable quantum computers.  We focus specifically on the difficulties associated with maintaining quantum coherence, a critical prerequisite for stable quantum computations.  The fragility of quantum states to environmental noise, leading to decoherence, remains a major obstacle.  Furthermore, the precise control and manipulation of qubits, the fundamental units of quantum information, pose significant engineering challenges, demanding highly refined fabrication techniques and cryogenic environments.  The scalability issue, concerning the efficient integration of increasing numbers of qubits while preserving coherence and connectivity, further complicates the path toward practical quantum computers.  This analysis will explore these limitations, examining recent advancements in qubit technologies, error correction methods, and material science aiming to overcome these experimental obstacles and pave the way for a future of powerful and reliable quantum computation.
