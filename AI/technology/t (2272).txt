Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intricately linked yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, aims to create systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Its conceptual foundations were laid in the mid-20th century, with the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956 widely considered its seminal event. Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, achieving limited success due to the computational constraints of the era.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a more practical approach. Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns from data, adapting and improving their performance over time.  This data-driven approach gained traction with the increasing availability of computational power and vast datasets in recent decades.  Key ML milestones include the development of backpropagation for training neural networks and the rise of sophisticated algorithms like support vector machines and random forests.  The convergence of powerful algorithms, readily available data, and enhanced computing resources has fueled the current resurgence of AI and ML, leading to breakthroughs in areas such as natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.  However, ongoing challenges remain, including issues of bias in data, explainability of complex models, and the ethical implications of increasingly autonomous systems.
