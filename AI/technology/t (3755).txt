Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) represent intertwined yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined as the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, boasts a history tracing back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, establishing its foundational goals of problem-solving and symbolic reasoning. Early successes, like the development of expert systems, were followed by periods of disillusionment as the limitations of symbolic approaches became apparent.

The resurgence of AI, particularly from the late 1990s onwards, is largely attributed to advancements in ML, a subset of AI focusing on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  ML algorithms, including decision trees, support vector machines, and neural networks, leverage statistical methods to identify patterns and make predictions. The proliferation of big data and increased computational power, especially through the advent of GPUs, has been instrumental in the recent breakthroughs in deep learning, a subfield of ML utilizing deep neural networks with multiple layers to achieve state-of-the-art performance in various domains, from image recognition to natural language processing.  However, critical challenges remain, including addressing bias in datasets, ensuring explainability and transparency in complex models, and mitigating ethical concerns related to their deployment in real-world applications.
