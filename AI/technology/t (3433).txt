The Internet of Things (IoT) has profoundly impacted residential environments, giving rise to the concept of the "smart home." This lecture explores the convergence of IoT technologies and domestic spaces, examining their functionalities and societal implications.  Smart homes utilize interconnected devices, ranging from smart appliances and lighting systems to security apparatus and entertainment hubs, all communicating via network protocols such as Wi-Fi and Zigbee.  Data aggregation and analysis, facilitated by cloud computing and edge computing architectures, enable automated functionalities and personalized user experiences. While offering enhanced convenience, energy efficiency, and security, the proliferation of IoT devices in homes raises concerns regarding data privacy, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and potential biases embedded in algorithmic decision-making processes.  Further research is crucial to address these challenges and to ensure the responsible and equitable development of smart home technologies, maximizing their benefits while mitigating inherent risks.  This requires a multidisciplinary approach involving computer scientists, engineers, social scientists, and policymakers.
