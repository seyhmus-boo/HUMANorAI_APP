Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct concepts.  AI, in its broadest sense, encompasses the creation of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Think of AI as the overarching goal – the aspiration to create intelligent machines.  Machine learning, on the other hand, is a crucial subset of AI, representing a specific approach to achieving this goal.  Instead of explicitly programming every rule and instruction, ML algorithms learn from data.  This is analogous to teaching a child to identify a cat: instead of providing a rigid definition, we show them many examples of cats – different breeds, colors, and poses – allowing them to gradually discern the common features.  Similarly, ML algorithms identify patterns and relationships within large datasets, adapting their performance over time without explicit reprogramming.  Deep learning, a more advanced form of ML, uses layered neural networks, mimicking the structure of the human brain to analyze complex data.  This is comparable to a child progressing from simple pattern recognition to understanding nuanced concepts and contexts through increasingly sophisticated learning.  Therefore, while all ML is AI, not all AI utilizes ML; some AI systems may rely on pre-programmed rules rather than learned behavior.
