Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly evolving fields with significant overlap. AI, broadly defined, encompasses the creation of systems capable of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. ML, a subset of AI, focuses on developing algorithms that enable systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This learning occurs through the identification of patterns and relationships within datasets, allowing for predictions and adjustments in system behavior.

Practical applications are diverse and rapidly expanding.  In healthcare, ML algorithms analyze medical images for disease detection, predict patient outcomes, and personalize treatment plans.  Finance utilizes AI for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk assessment.  Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on both AI and ML for navigation, object recognition, and decision-making in dynamic environments.  Furthermore, natural language processing (NLP), an AI subfield leveraging ML, powers chatbots, language translation tools, and sentiment analysis in marketing and social media monitoring.  The continued development and refinement of AI and ML techniques promise to revolutionize numerous sectors, though ethical considerations regarding bias, transparency, and job displacement remain crucial areas of ongoing research and debate.
