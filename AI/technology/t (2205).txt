Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly transforming various sectors, yet their core concepts remain elusive to many. This presentation employs accessible analogies to clarify these powerful technologies.  We will illustrate AI as a sophisticated chess-playing program: it doesn't inherently understand the game, but through complex algorithms, it can analyze millions of moves and predict optimal strategies, surpassing human capabilities in certain aspects. This mirrors AI's ability to solve complex problems through pattern recognition and decision-making, albeit without genuine understanding.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, can be likened to a child learning to identify a cat. Initially, it requires numerous examples – images labelled "cat" – to develop an internal model.  Over time, through iterative exposure and feedback, its ability to correctly identify cats, even those varying in breed, size, and pose, improves. This demonstrates ML's ability to learn from data without explicit programming, adapting and refining its performance based on experience.  We will explore the distinctions between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning using further illustrative examples, ultimately providing a foundational understanding of AI and ML's potential and limitations.  The presentation aims to demystify these complex fields, making them readily comprehensible to a broad audience.
