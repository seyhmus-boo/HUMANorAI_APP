This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) technologies.  While current AR/VR applications primarily rely on classical computational methods, we propose that leveraging quantum phenomena could significantly enhance their capabilities.  Specifically, we examine potential applications of quantum computing in rendering highly realistic and complex virtual environments, surpassing the limitations of classical algorithms in simulating intricate physical interactions and rendering high-fidelity graphics.  We discuss the potential for quantum algorithms to accelerate real-time processing of sensor data in AR applications, leading to improved object recognition and tracking accuracy.  Furthermore, we explore the implications of quantum entanglement for creating more immersive and interactive experiences, enabling novel forms of user interaction and feedback beyond the scope of classical systems.  Finally, we address the challenges inherent in translating theoretical quantum advantages into practical AR/VR applications, including hardware limitations and the development of quantum-enhanced software architectures.  This presentation will offer a preliminary exploration of this exciting frontier, identifying promising research avenues and highlighting the transformative potential of quantum mechanics for the future of AR/VR.
