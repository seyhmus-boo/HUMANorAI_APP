Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications represent a rapidly evolving technological landscape with significant implications across diverse sectors.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception and interaction through devices such as smartphones and smart glasses.  This technology finds applications in fields ranging from interactive gaming and e-commerce to medical training and industrial maintenance, offering benefits such as improved user experience, enhanced visualization, and reduced training costs.  VR, conversely, immerses users in completely simulated environments, generating a sense of presence through head-mounted displays and haptic feedback systems.  Its applications are similarly diverse, encompassing virtual tourism, architectural design, and therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD.  This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of both AR and VR, examining their respective strengths and limitations concerning user experience, technological feasibility, and ethical considerations.  Furthermore, we analyze the potential for synergistic integration of AR and VR technologies to create hybrid environments that offer novel opportunities for human-computer interaction.
