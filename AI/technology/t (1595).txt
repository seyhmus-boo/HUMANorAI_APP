Cloud computing, initially conceived as utility computing, has undergone a rapid and transformative evolution since its inception.  This paper summarizes the key phases of this development, highlighting the shift from early grid computing models towards the sophisticated, service-oriented architectures prevalent today.  Initially characterized by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), offering virtualized hardware resources, the landscape expanded to encompass Platform as a Service (PaaS), providing development and deployment environments, and subsequently Software as a Service (SaaS), delivering fully functional applications.  This layered approach reflects a growing emphasis on abstraction and user-friendliness.  Furthermore, the evolution has been driven by advancements in virtualization technologies, network infrastructure (particularly high-speed broadband and improved network security), and the development of robust APIs and management tools.  Contemporary trends indicate a movement towards serverless computing, edge computing, and increasingly sophisticated AI-powered automation within cloud environments.  These advancements continue to reshape the technological landscape, impacting diverse sectors from healthcare and finance to research and entertainment.  Future research should focus on addressing challenges related to data security, privacy, and the environmental impact of large-scale cloud deployments.
