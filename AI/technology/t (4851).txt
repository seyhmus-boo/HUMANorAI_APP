Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture will briefly explore the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the creation of intelligent agents capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. Its conceptual roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, marking a pivotal moment in its formalization.  However, early AI struggled with limitations in computational power and algorithmic sophistication.

Machine Learning, a subset of AI, emerged as a powerful approach to overcome these hurdles.  Instead of explicitly programming every rule, ML algorithms learn patterns from data. This paradigm shift, particularly fueled by advancements in computing power and the availability of vast datasets, has led to remarkable progress in recent decades.  Different ML approaches exist, including supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding structure in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).  The synergy between AI's overarching goal and ML's data-driven methodology has propelled the current AI revolution, with applications spanning diverse fields from healthcare to finance.
