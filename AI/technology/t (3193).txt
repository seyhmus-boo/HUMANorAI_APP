This presentation examines the evolving landscape of cybersecurity challenges and the emergent solutions designed to mitigate them.  Recent developments in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly impacted both the offensive and defensive sides of cybersecurity. While AI-powered tools offer advanced threat detection and automated response capabilities, malicious actors are increasingly leveraging AI for sophisticated phishing campaigns, malware creation, and the exploitation of vulnerabilities at unprecedented scale.  We will explore the implications of this AI arms race, specifically highlighting the challenges posed by generative AI in creating realistic deepfakes and highly personalized attacks.

Furthermore, the increasing reliance on cloud computing and the proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices introduce new attack surfaces and vulnerabilities.  The presentation will discuss the effectiveness of existing security measures, such as zero-trust architectures and blockchain technologies, in addressing these challenges.  Finally, we will analyze the crucial role of human factors in cybersecurity, addressing the persistent problem of social engineering attacks and the need for enhanced cybersecurity awareness training.  The presentation concludes by outlining promising avenues for future research, focusing on the development of more robust, adaptive, and AI-resistant security systems capable of navigating the increasingly complex digital threat landscape.
