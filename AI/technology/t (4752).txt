This presentation examines the multifaceted cybersecurity challenges of the modern digital landscape and explores the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in developing effective solutions.  The escalating sophistication of cyber threats necessitates a departure from siloed approaches, demanding integration across computer science, law, social sciences, and management.  We will highlight key challenges, including the increasing prevalence of advanced persistent threats (APTs), the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to cyberattacks, and the ethical dilemmas surrounding data privacy and surveillance.  Furthermore, we will analyze how interdisciplinary perspectives contribute to robust solutions. This includes leveraging sociological insights into human behaviour to mitigate social engineering attacks, applying legal frameworks to establish accountability and deter malicious activity, and utilizing management strategies to enhance organizational resilience and incident response capabilities.  The presentation will conclude by arguing that fostering interdisciplinary research, education, and collaboration is not merely beneficial but essential for navigating the ever-evolving cybersecurity threat landscape and building a more secure digital future.  Specific examples of successful interdisciplinary initiatives will be presented to illustrate the practical applications of this integrated approach.
