Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, while experiencing a surge in popularity and application in recent years, possess a history rooted in the mid-20th century.  Early conceptualizations emerged alongside advancements in computer graphics and display technology, with Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) representing a pioneering, albeit largely unsuccessful, attempt at immersive sensory simulation.  Subsequent decades witnessed iterative progress, including Ivan Sutherland's "The Ultimate Display" (1968), a foundational concept for head-mounted displays, and the development of early VR systems within military and research settings.  However, limitations in processing power and display resolution hindered widespread adoption.  The turn of the millennium saw renewed interest, fueled by improvements in computing capabilities and the emergence of more affordable hardware.  This research paper examines the burgeoning field of AR and VR applications, exploring their diverse implementations across various sectors.  We analyze the technological advancements driving this growth, focusing on key hardware and software developments, while critically evaluating the current limitations and exploring the ethical considerations and societal impacts of their increasing integration into everyday life.  Finally, we will consider future trends and potential applications of these transformative technologies.
