Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  ML algorithms identify patterns and build predictive models by analyzing large datasets, iteratively improving their accuracy through feedback mechanisms.  This contrasts with traditional AI approaches relying on pre-defined rules.

The core difference lies in their approach: AI aims for general intelligence, while ML targets specific tasks.  ML's practical applications are ubiquitous.  In healthcare, ML algorithms diagnose diseases from medical images with increasing accuracy.  Finance utilizes ML for fraud detection and algorithmic trading.  In manufacturing, predictive maintenance reduces downtime by analyzing sensor data.  Furthermore, natural language processing, a key area of ML, powers virtual assistants and language translation services.  The continuous development and refinement of ML techniques are driving advancements across numerous sectors, propelling AI towards increasingly sophisticated applications.
