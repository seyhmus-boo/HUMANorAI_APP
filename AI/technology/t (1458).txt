Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles.  The rise of these vehicles can be understood through the lens of several converging technological advancements.  Think of it as a confluence of rivers â€“ each representing a crucial technology, like advancements in sensor technology (the LiDAR "eyes" and radar "ears"),  computer processing power (the "brain" capable of processing vast amounts of data in real-time), and artificial intelligence (the "mind" enabling decision-making).

Initially, these rivers flowed independently.  However, Moore's Law, the exponential increase in computing power, acted as a dam, creating the necessary pressure for these technologies to converge. This convergence, analogous to a powerful new river formed by the confluence, has created the conditions for the rapid development of autonomous vehicles.  Furthermore, the increasing availability of high-definition mapping and the regulatory frameworks slowly being established are analogous to the creation of a navigable channel, further facilitating the flow of this technological innovation.  We are, therefore, witnessing not just the emergence, but the accelerating rise of autonomous vehicles.
