This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in researching the impact of 5G networks on diverse technological sectors. While 5G promises transformative advancements across numerous fields, validating these claims experimentally presents significant hurdles.  The high frequencies employed by 5G necessitate meticulous control of experimental environments to mitigate signal attenuation and interference, requiring specialized equipment and sophisticated signal processing techniques. Reproducibility across different geographical locations and hardware platforms also poses a considerable challenge, hindering the generalizability of experimental findings. Furthermore, the sheer volume of data generated by 5G necessitates robust data acquisition, storage, and processing infrastructure, often exceeding the capabilities of existing laboratory setups.  This presentation will detail specific experimental challenges encountered in evaluating 5G's impact on applications such as autonomous vehicles, augmented reality, and the Internet of Things (IoT), highlighting the limitations of current methodologies and proposing potential solutions. We will discuss the need for standardized experimental frameworks and collaborative research initiatives to overcome these hurdles and foster a deeper understanding of 5G's true technological potential.
