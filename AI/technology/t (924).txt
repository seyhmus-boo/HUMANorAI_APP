The Internet of Things (IoT) promises a revolution in domestic life, with smart homes leveraging interconnected devices to enhance comfort, security, and efficiency.  While the conceptual framework of smart homes is relatively well-established, the practical implementation and experimental validation of IoT-based systems present significant challenges. This paper explores these experimental hurdles inherent in researching IoT and smart home technologies.  Specifically, we focus on the difficulties associated with replicating realistic home environments in controlled experimental settings, encompassing issues of heterogeneous device compatibility, data heterogeneity and volume, and the inherent complexity of modelling human-device interaction. Furthermore, the ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and security within experimental smart home setups present a substantial methodological challenge, demanding rigorous protocols for data anonymization and consent management.  Finally, the long-term reliability and scalability of IoT systems, often overlooked in short-term experiments, will be addressed.  By analyzing these experimental challenges, this paper aims to contribute to a more robust and rigorous methodology for evaluating the efficacy and impact of IoT implementations in smart homes.
