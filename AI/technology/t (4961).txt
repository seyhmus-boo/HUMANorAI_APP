Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly transforming numerous sectors, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to their development and application. This paper explores the multifaceted nature of AR and VR, highlighting their increasingly significant impact across diverse fields.  While traditionally considered technological domains, the successful implementation of AR/VR applications requires contributions from a wide spectrum of disciplines.  Human-computer interaction (HCI) is crucial for designing intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, while psychology and cognitive science contribute to understanding user experience, immersion, and potential cognitive effects.  Furthermore, the design and implementation of AR/VR systems necessitates expertise in computer graphics, software engineering, and data visualization.  Beyond these core areas, fields such as medicine leverage AR/VR for surgical simulations and therapeutic interventions, while education integrates them for immersive learning experiences.  This paper will delve into these interdisciplinary links, examining specific examples of successful collaborations and highlighting the challenges associated with bridging the gap between technological advancement and real-world application across diverse sectors.  By investigating these connections, we aim to illuminate the crucial role of interdisciplinarity in maximizing the potential of AR and VR technologies.
