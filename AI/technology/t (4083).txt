Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrency, has rapidly expanded its application beyond finance. This presentation provides an overview of blockchain's core functionalities – decentralization, immutability, and transparency – and explores its burgeoning applications across diverse sectors.  Recent advancements, particularly in scalability solutions like sharding and layer-2 protocols, are significantly mitigating earlier limitations related to transaction throughput and cost.  We will examine the impact of these improvements on the practical implementation of blockchain in supply chain management, where enhanced traceability and authenticity verification are revolutionizing product provenance.  Furthermore, we will discuss the emerging role of blockchain in digital identity management, offering secure and self-sovereign control over personal data.  The presentation also touches upon the challenges and limitations remaining, including regulatory uncertainty and the energy consumption associated with some blockchain networks. Finally, we will briefly speculate on future directions, including the integration of blockchain with other emerging technologies like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.
