Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns cloud computing and its evolutionary trajectory.  Initially, imagine computing as a private, on-site power plant:  all resources resided within a single, self-contained entity.  This is analogous to early mainframes.  The evolution began with the decentralization of resources, akin to connecting multiple smaller power plants to a grid. This represents the rise of client-server architectures and the early internet.  However, this grid lacked the sophisticated management of a truly unified system.

The emergence of cloud computing represents a paradigm shift, like the invention of the smart grid:  a vast, interconnected network capable of dynamically allocating resources, similar to how electricity is routed efficiently across a national power system.  This allows for scalability and on-demand provisioning, mirroring the flexibility of the smart grid's responsiveness to fluctuating energy demands.  We've progressed from owning and maintaining our own power plant (on-premise infrastructure) to accessing electricity as a utility (cloud services). This ongoing evolution involves ever-increasing sophistication in resource management, data analytics, and security, further enhancing the efficiency and utility of this digital "power grid."
