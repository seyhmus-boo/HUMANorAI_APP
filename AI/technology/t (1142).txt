Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly expanding their application domains across diverse sectors.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception and interaction with their environment.  Applications range from interactive gaming and heads-up displays in manufacturing to medical training simulations and retail experiences leveraging virtual try-ons.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely computer-generated environments, offering a high degree of presence and engagement.  VR finds utility in areas such as architectural visualization, flight simulation, therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD, and immersive entertainment.  The convergence of AR and VR, often termed mixed reality (MR), further broadens the potential, allowing seamless blending of real and virtual elements.  However, challenges remain, including the development of more intuitive interfaces, addressing issues of motion sickness and cybersecurity concerns in VR, and mitigating the cost and accessibility barriers for widespread adoption.  Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of prolonged exposure to these technologies and to optimize their application for specific user needs and contexts.
