Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related technological advancements in human-computer interaction, boasting a history rooted in early flight simulators and head-mounted displays of the 1960s.  AR overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real world, enhancing perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely synthetic environments, typically requiring specialized headsets and input devices.

Applications span diverse fields.  In medicine, VR facilitates surgical planning and phobia treatment, while AR aids in diagnosis and patient education.  Engineering utilizes both for design visualization and maintenance training, enhancing efficiency and safety.  Entertainment benefits greatly, with VR driving immersive gaming experiences and AR enriching storytelling through interactive elements.  Moreover, AR finds increasing utility in retail, enabling virtual try-ons and product visualization, while VR explores applications in education and remote collaboration.  Ongoing research focuses on improving haptic feedback, minimizing motion sickness, and broadening accessibility to these transformative technologies.
