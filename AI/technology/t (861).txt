Blockchain technology, initially conceived as the underlying architecture for Bitcoin in 2008, has rapidly evolved beyond its cryptographic currency origins. This presentation provides a concise overview of blockchain's historical development and its diverse applications. We begin by examining the foundational concepts of distributed ledger technology (DLT), focusing on its decentralization, immutability, and transparency characteristics.  These core features address limitations inherent in traditional centralized systems, fostering trust and enhancing security.  The presentation then explores a range of blockchain applications, including its potential in supply chain management for improved traceability and fraud prevention, its role in secure digital identity management, and its use in healthcare for streamlining data sharing and patient record management.  Furthermore, we will touch upon the ongoing challenges, such as scalability issues and regulatory uncertainties, that hinder widespread blockchain adoption.  Finally, we will briefly discuss future research directions and the potential societal impact of this transformative technology, highlighting its capacity to revolutionize various sectors and redefine trust mechanisms in a digital age.
