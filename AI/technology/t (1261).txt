Cloud computing, initially conceived as a utility computing model, has undergone a significant evolution since its inception. This review traces its trajectory from early grid computing and utility computing concepts to the present-day multifaceted landscape encompassing Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS).  The transition witnessed a shift from primarily relying on virtualization technologies to embracing containerization, serverless computing, and edge computing paradigms.  Key drivers of this evolution include advancements in networking technologies, the proliferation of mobile devices, and the burgeoning demand for scalable and cost-effective IT solutions.  While offering unparalleled flexibility and scalability, the review also highlights the inherent challenges associated with cloud computing, including security concerns, vendor lock-in, and data privacy issues.  Future directions are anticipated to focus on enhancing security, fostering interoperability across cloud platforms, and exploring the potential of quantum computing integration within the cloud ecosystem.  Overall, the evolution of cloud computing demonstrates its ongoing adaptation to meet the ever-changing needs of the digital age.
