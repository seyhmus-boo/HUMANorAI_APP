Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related technological advancements with burgeoning applications across diverse sectors.  AR overlays computer-generated imagery onto the real-world environment, enhancing user perception through real-time interaction.  Examples include navigation systems that project directions onto street views, interactive gaming experiences that integrate digital objects with physical surroundings, and medical applications enabling surgeons to visualize internal anatomy during procedures.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, isolating them from the physical world through sensory input manipulation.  This technology finds practical use in flight simulation training, where pilots can practice maneuvers in a risk-free setting, architectural visualization, allowing clients to explore building designs before construction, and therapeutic interventions for treating phobias and PTSD by providing controlled exposure therapy.  The convergence of AR and VR technologies is also generating innovative applications, such as mixed reality systems that blend real and virtual elements seamlessly, promising further advancements in fields ranging from education and entertainment to industrial design and healthcare.  The ongoing development and refinement of AR and VR technologies continue to expand their potential for transformative impact across multiple disciplines.
