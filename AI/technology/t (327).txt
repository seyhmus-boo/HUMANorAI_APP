This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, examining their diverse practical implementations across various sectors.  We will discuss the fundamental technological differences between AR, which overlays digital information onto the real world, and VR, which creates immersive, entirely simulated environments.  The presentation will then delve into key application areas, focusing on the transformative potential of these technologies. Examples include their use in training and simulation, where AR/VR offers safe and cost-effective practice scenarios for fields like surgery, aviation, and manufacturing.  We will also explore their impact on design and architecture, enabling architects and clients to visualize building projects in immersive 3D spaces before construction commences. Furthermore, the presentation will touch upon the burgeoning use of AR/VR in marketing and retail, allowing for enhanced product visualization and interactive customer experiences. Finally, we will briefly address the challenges and ethical considerations surrounding the widespread adoption of these technologies, including accessibility, data privacy, and potential for misuse.
