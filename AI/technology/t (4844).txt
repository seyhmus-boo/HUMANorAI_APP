Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).  Imagine VR as a complete immersion, like stepping into a meticulously crafted film set; you're entirely surrounded by a computer-generated environment.  Think of video games like *Half-Life: Alyx* as a prime example: you inhabit a virtual world, interacting with its elements through specialized headsets.

In contrast, AR overlays digital information onto the real world, much like a transparent, interactive layer. Consider Pokemon Go: the game's digital creatures appear superimposed on the user's view of their actual surroundings, using their smartphone's camera as a window.  Another analogy: imagine a surgeon using AR glasses to see a patient's internal anatomy projected onto their body during an operation â€“ the real-world patient augmented with digital anatomical data.  While VR offers complete escapism, AR enhances our perception of reality, creating a blended experience.  Both technologies hold immense potential across numerous sectors, from entertainment and gaming to medicine and engineering.
