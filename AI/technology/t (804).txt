This review examines the burgeoning field of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, highlighting their diverse functionalities and impacts across various sectors.  While VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, AR overlays digital information onto the real world, offering distinct yet complementary capabilities.  Applications range from immersive gaming and entertainment experiences to transformative tools in healthcare (surgical simulations, therapeutic interventions), engineering (design visualization, remote collaboration), and education (interactive learning environments, virtual field trips).  The review analyzes the technological advancements driving the growth of both fields, including improvements in display technology, tracking systems, and processing power.  However, challenges remain, particularly concerning issues of accessibility, cost-effectiveness, and potential negative impacts such as motion sickness, eye strain, and social isolation.  Further research is needed to address these challenges and explore the ethical implications of widespread AR/VR adoption, emphasizing user experience and safety alongside technological progress.  The potential for AR/VR to revolutionize numerous aspects of daily life remains significant, warranting continued investigation and responsible development.
