The future of quantum computing hinges significantly on overcoming substantial experimental challenges.  Maintaining quantum coherence, the delicate superposition of states crucial for computation, remains a major hurdle.  Environmental noise, including thermal fluctuations and electromagnetic interference, rapidly decoheres qubits, limiting computation time and fidelity.  Scaling up the number of qubits, necessary for tackling complex problems, presents a formidable engineering challenge.  Current qubit fabrication techniques, whether employing superconducting circuits, trapped ions, or photonic systems, struggle to achieve high qubit counts while maintaining individual qubit control and connectivity.  Furthermore, the development of robust error correction codes capable of mitigating the effects of decoherence and faulty gates requires both theoretical breakthroughs and significant advances in experimental control.  Finally, the creation of fault-tolerant quantum computers necessitates the development of sophisticated cryogenic systems to maintain the extremely low temperatures required by many qubit technologies, posing significant logistical and engineering complexities.  Addressing these experimental obstacles is paramount to realizing the transformative potential of quantum computation.
