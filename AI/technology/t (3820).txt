The rapid advancement of autonomous vehicle (AV) technology is transforming the transportation landscape. Recent developments have focused on enhancing sensor fusion techniques, integrating diverse data streams from LiDAR, radar, and cameras to achieve robust perception in complex environments.  Deep learning architectures, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), are increasingly sophisticated in processing this sensor data, enabling improved object detection, classification, and tracking, even in adverse weather conditions.  Simultaneously, advancements in planning and control algorithms, incorporating techniques like model predictive control and reinforcement learning, are leading to safer and more efficient navigation strategies.  The development of high-definition (HD) maps, crucial for precise localization and path planning, is also accelerating.  Despite significant progress, challenges remain, including ensuring functional safety and addressing ethical dilemmas related to decision-making in unavoidable accident scenarios.  Furthermore, robust cybersecurity measures are essential to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.  Ongoing research addresses these challenges to pave the way for widespread AV deployment and its societal impact.
