Cloud computing, once a nascent technological frontier, has rapidly evolved, transforming from a niche service to the backbone of modern digital infrastructure.  This presentation traces this evolution, using familiar analogies to illuminate key shifts. Initially, cloud services resembled a shared, centrally managed server room (IaaS), offering basic compute and storage resources.  Think of this as a co-working space: individual tenants share resources, but retain control over their individual setups.  The next stage saw the emergence of PaaS, analogous to a pre-fabricated house; developers receive a ready-made environment, focusing on application building rather than infrastructure management.  Finally, SaaS, akin to renting a fully furnished apartment, provides complete, ready-to-use applications, eliminating the need for any infrastructure management whatsoever. This progression mirrors a broader shift from hardware-centric to software-defined infrastructure.  We will also discuss the emerging trends, such as serverless computing (think on-demand utilities) and edge computing (decentralized processing, like a network of local convenience stores supplementing a large central warehouse), demonstrating how cloud computing continues to adapt and redefine its boundaries.  The presentation will conclude by examining the implications of this rapid evolution for businesses and society.
