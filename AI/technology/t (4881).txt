Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are intertwined yet distinct fields within computer science. AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms that allow systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  ML algorithms identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time through iterative processes.  Supervised learning uses labelled datasets to train models, while unsupervised learning discovers patterns in unlabelled data. Reinforcement learning involves training agents to interact with an environment and maximize a reward signal.  The synergy between AI and ML is evident in numerous applications, ranging from natural language processing and computer vision to robotics and healthcare.  However, challenges remain, including addressing biases in training data, ensuring model explainability and transparency, and mitigating potential ethical implications of increasingly autonomous systems.  Future research should prioritize developing robust, reliable, and ethically sound AI and ML systems.
