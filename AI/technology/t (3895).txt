Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrency, has evolved into a versatile distributed ledger technology (DLT) with diverse applications beyond finance. This presentation explores the foundational principles of blockchain, including its cryptographic security, decentralized architecture, and consensus mechanisms.  We examine its core functionalities – immutability, transparency, and traceability – and analyze how these properties contribute to enhanced security and trust in various sectors.  Specific application areas will be discussed, including supply chain management, where blockchain facilitates provenance tracking and combats counterfeiting; digital identity verification, offering secure and tamper-proof identity management; and healthcare, enabling secure data sharing and patient record management.  The presentation will also address the challenges facing widespread blockchain adoption, such as scalability limitations, regulatory uncertainty, and the energy consumption associated with certain consensus mechanisms.  Finally, we will briefly explore future research directions, focusing on the development of more efficient and sustainable blockchain solutions and the ethical implications of this transformative technology.
