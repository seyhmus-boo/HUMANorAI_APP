This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in researching the Internet of Things (IoT) within the context of smart homes. While the proliferation of smart home devices promises enhanced convenience and efficiency, rigorous experimentation to validate these claims presents significant hurdles.  We will discuss three key areas:  (1) **Data Heterogeneity:**  Integrating data from diverse IoT devices with varying communication protocols, data formats, and reliability levels poses a considerable challenge for consistent and comparable experimental results.  (2) **Environmental Variability:**  Smart home environments are inherently dynamic, influenced by unpredictable user behavior and external factors.  Controlling and accounting for this variability is crucial for establishing causal relationships between IoT interventions and observed outcomes. (3) **Ethical Considerations:**  Experiments involving smart home technologies frequently raise privacy and security concerns.  The ethical implications of data collection, storage, and analysis, particularly regarding user consent and data anonymization, must be carefully addressed throughout the experimental design and execution.  We will illustrate these challenges with specific examples from ongoing research, highlighting methodological strategies employed to mitigate them and ultimately contribute to more robust and reliable findings in the field of smart home IoT research.
