Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles.  The rise of these vehicles mirrors the evolution of flight, initially a daring, unreliable feat, gradually transitioning to routine air travel.  Early autonomous vehicles, like the Wright brothers' airplane, were experimental, prone to errors, and limited in scope.  However, parallel advancements in several crucial areas—similar to the development of lighter materials and more efficient engines in aviation—have propelled the field forward.

Consider the analogy of a human driver:  perception (cameras, radar, lidar mimicking our eyes), decision-making (algorithms acting like our brains), and action (steering, acceleration, braking replicating our limbs).  Each component, initially rudimentary, has experienced significant sophistication through machine learning and artificial intelligence.   Just as the mass production of cars revolutionized personal transport, the scaling up of autonomous vehicle technology, overcoming challenges like robust software and ethical considerations, promises a paradigm shift in mobility, potentially reducing accidents and improving efficiency, though societal adaptation remains a crucial hurdle.
