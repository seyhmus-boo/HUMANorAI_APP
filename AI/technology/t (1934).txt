This presentation explores the burgeoning intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart homes, highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary collaborations necessary for successful implementation and responsible development.  While the technological advancements in sensor networks, data analytics, and embedded systems are central to IoT's functionality within the domestic sphere,  a holistic understanding necessitates engagement beyond computer science and engineering.

We argue that successful smart home integration requires significant contributions from fields such as human-computer interaction (HCI) to ensure intuitive and user-friendly interfaces, mitigating issues of usability and accessibility.  Furthermore, social sciences, particularly sociology and psychology, are crucial in understanding user adoption patterns, privacy concerns, and the potential impact on social dynamics within the household.  Architectural design and urban planning also play a role, considering the integration of smart home technologies into existing and future building infrastructure.

Finally, ethical and legal considerations, including data security, algorithmic bias, and potential vulnerabilities, necessitate collaboration with legal scholars and ethicists.  This presentation will illustrate these interdisciplinary links through specific examples, emphasizing the need for a multi-faceted approach to realizing the full potential of IoT in smart homes while mitigating associated risks.
