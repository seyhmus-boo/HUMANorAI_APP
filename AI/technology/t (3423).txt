The advent of quantum computing presents both unprecedented challenges and potential solutions to the field of cybersecurity.  Current cryptographic systems, reliant on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithm problems (e.g., RSA, ECC), are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers employing algorithms like Shor's algorithm.  This poses a significant threat to data confidentiality, integrity, and availability across various sectors.  The challenge lies not only in the development of post-quantum cryptography (PQC) algorithms resistant to quantum attacks, but also in the secure transition to these new algorithms.  This transition requires careful consideration of interoperability, backwards compatibility, and the potential for legacy systems to remain vulnerable.  Solutions involve exploring diverse PQC approaches such as lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, and multivariate cryptography.  Furthermore, quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a potential solution by leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to establish unconditionally secure communication channels. However, QKD faces practical challenges related to scalability, distance limitations, and the need for robust quantum infrastructure.  Ultimately, a comprehensive approach encompassing PQC, QKD, and robust quantum-resistant protocols is crucial to mitigating the cybersecurity risks associated with the quantum era.
