Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrency, has rapidly evolved beyond its foundational application, demonstrating significant potential across diverse sectors. This presentation provides an overview of blockchain's core functionalities and its expanding applications, emphasizing recent advancements.  We will explore the shift from public permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin to permissioned and hybrid models better suited for enterprise use cases.  Recent developments in scalability solutions, such as sharding and layer-2 protocols, will be discussed, highlighting their crucial role in addressing limitations inherent in earlier blockchain architectures.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the burgeoning applications of blockchain in supply chain management, enhancing transparency and traceability;  in digital identity verification, improving security and reducing fraud; and in decentralized finance (DeFi), revolutionizing financial services.  Finally, we will briefly address the ongoing challenges and potential future directions of blockchain technology, including regulatory frameworks and the need for further interoperability between different blockchain systems.  The presentation aims to provide an accessible yet rigorous overview of this rapidly evolving field.
