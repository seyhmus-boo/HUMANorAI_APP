The advent of quantum computing presents both unprecedented opportunities and significant threats to cybersecurity.  Existing cryptographic systems, reliant on the computational difficulty of factoring large numbers or discrete logarithms, are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers.  This abstract examines the multifaceted challenges posed by this quantum threat landscape.  Shor's algorithm highlights the vulnerability of currently prevalent public-key cryptography, necessitating the development of quantum-resistant cryptography (QRC) algorithms.  Post-quantum cryptography (PQC), encompassing lattice-based, code-based, multivariate, and hash-based techniques, offers potential solutions, though their performance and security require rigorous analysis and standardization efforts.  Beyond algorithmic vulnerabilities, quantum key distribution (QKD) leveraging quantum mechanical principles offers theoretically secure key exchange, but faces practical limitations concerning scalability, infrastructure requirements, and susceptibility to side-channel attacks.  Furthermore, the development of quantum-enhanced cryptanalysis poses a significant threat to classical and even some PQC algorithms. This necessitates a multi-pronged approach to securing future digital infrastructure, integrating QRC, QKD, and enhanced classical security measures to mitigate the inherent risks of a quantum-enabled world. Future research must focus on practical implementations of QRC and robust defenses against quantum-enhanced attacks to ensure long-term cybersecurity resilience.
