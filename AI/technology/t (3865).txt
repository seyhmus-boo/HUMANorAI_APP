This review examines the rapidly evolving fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on their current capabilities and limitations.  AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating intelligent agents, leverages ML algorithms – particularly deep learning – to achieve increasingly sophisticated performance in various domains.  Recent advancements in deep learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks, have propelled breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive modelling.  However, challenges remain, including addressing biases embedded in training data, ensuring model interpretability and explainability, and mitigating the ethical implications of autonomous AI systems.  While ML demonstrates remarkable potential for automating complex tasks and generating valuable insights from large datasets, concerns regarding data privacy, algorithmic fairness, and the societal impact of widespread AI adoption necessitate ongoing interdisciplinary research. This review highlights the need for robust regulatory frameworks and ethical guidelines to navigate the transformative potential and inherent risks associated with the continued development and deployment of AI and ML technologies.
