The proliferation of the Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted residential environments, leading to the emergence of smart homes.  These systems integrate various interconnected devices, enabling automated control and enhanced functionality within the domestic sphere.  While the potential benefits, encompassing energy efficiency, security enhancements, and improved quality of life, are widely acknowledged, realizing this potential faces considerable experimental challenges. This paper focuses on the key hurdles hindering rigorous empirical investigation within the context of smart home IoT research.  We address the difficulties inherent in establishing controlled experimental environments, replicating real-world usage patterns, and accurately measuring the impact of IoT interventions on diverse user behaviors and contexts.  Furthermore, data privacy and security concerns, along with the inherent heterogeneity of IoT devices and protocols, pose significant methodological obstacles.  This research explores these challenges, reviewing existing methodologies and proposing potential solutions to facilitate more robust and generalizable experimental findings in the field of smart home IoT research, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced understanding of its real-world impact.
