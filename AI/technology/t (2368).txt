Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the evolution of cloud computing.  Initially conceived as a decentralized network of servers providing on-demand resources, cloud computing has undergone a dramatic transformation.  Early models, exemplified by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), focused primarily on virtualized hardware provision.  However, subsequent developments introduced Platform as a Service (PaaS), abstracting away infrastructure management, and Software as a Service (SaaS), delivering fully functional applications over the internet.

Recent advancements centre on several key areas.  Serverless computing, eliminating the need for managing servers entirely, offers significant scalability and cost efficiency.  The proliferation of edge computing addresses latency concerns by processing data closer to its source.  Furthermore, significant progress in artificial intelligence and machine learning has integrated these technologies directly within cloud platforms, offering readily available AI/ML capabilities for diverse applications.  Finally, the increasing emphasis on security and compliance through robust encryption and access control mechanisms marks a crucial development in the ongoing evolution of this pivotal technology.  These trends are reshaping how we approach software development, data management, and overall IT infrastructure.
