Blockchain technology, a distributed ledger system, transcends its initial application in cryptocurrencies.  This lecture explores its core functionalities, namely decentralization, immutability, and transparency, which facilitate a range of applications beyond financial transactions.  Decentralization mitigates single points of failure and enhances data security. Immutability ensures data integrity, preventing unauthorized alterations, while transparency, albeit conditional on design, fosters trust and accountability.  Applications discussed include supply chain management, improving traceability and reducing counterfeiting; digital identity verification, offering secure and verifiable credentials; and healthcare data management, enabling secure and interoperable patient records.  However, scalability challenges, regulatory uncertainties, and the energy consumption of some blockchain implementations remain significant obstacles to wider adoption.  Future research should focus on optimizing these aspects to fully realize the transformative potential of this disruptive technology across diverse sectors.
