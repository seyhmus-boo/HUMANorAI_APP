Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) represent distinct yet intertwined fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of intelligent agents capable of performing tasks typically requiring human intelligence. This includes reasoning, problem-solving, learning, and perception.  ML, a subset of AI, focuses on the development of algorithms that allow systems to learn from and make predictions based on data, without explicit programming.  ML algorithms utilize statistical techniques and pattern recognition to identify underlying relationships within datasets, enabling them to improve their performance over time.  Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning represent key paradigms within ML, each employing different approaches to data analysis and model optimization. The synergistic relationship between AI and ML is evident, with ML providing a crucial mechanism for achieving intelligent behaviour in AI systems.  Further advancements in ML algorithms, particularly within deep learning architectures, are driving significant progress in diverse AI applications, spanning natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics.
