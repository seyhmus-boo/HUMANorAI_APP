The advent of autonomous vehicles (AVs) marks a significant technological leap with the potential to revolutionize transportation systems globally.  While the current proliferation of partially autonomous features in commercially available vehicles captures public attention, the concept of self-driving vehicles boasts a surprisingly lengthy history.  Early conceptualizations emerged in the mid-20th century, with General Motors showcasing automated highway systems as early as the 1950s.  However, limitations in computing power, sensor technology, and artificial intelligence constrained the practical realization of fully autonomous capabilities.  Significant progress throughout the latter half of the 20th century, particularly in areas such as computer vision and machine learning, laid the groundwork for the recent surge in AV development.  This paper examines the trajectory of AV technology, analyzing the key technological advancements, socio-economic implications, and regulatory challenges that have contributed to its rapid rise.  We will explore the confluence of factors – from increased computing power and the emergence of sophisticated sensor arrays to algorithmic breakthroughs in perception, planning, and control – that have propelled AVs from a futuristic fantasy to a rapidly approaching reality.  Further, the paper will assess the ethical and societal questions raised by this transformative technology.
