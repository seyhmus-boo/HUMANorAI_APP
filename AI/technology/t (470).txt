The Internet of Things (IoT) and its application in smart homes represent a significant technological advancement with roots in early home automation systems of the late 20th century.  Initially characterized by isolated, proprietary systems,  the convergence of ubiquitous internet access and miniaturized computing power propelled the development of interconnected smart home devices in the 21st century.  This review examines the evolution from basic remote-controlled appliances to sophisticated ecosystems capable of learning user behaviour and proactively adjusting environmental parameters.  While offering significant improvements in energy efficiency, security, and convenience through features like automated lighting, climate control, and security systems, the IoT smart home paradigm also presents challenges.  Concerns regarding data privacy, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and the potential for vendor lock-in require further investigation.  Furthermore,  the environmental impact of manufacturing and disposing of numerous interconnected devices necessitates a critical assessment of the long-term sustainability of this technology.  Future research should focus on developing robust security protocols and energy-efficient designs to fully realize the potential of the IoT smart home while mitigating its inherent risks.
