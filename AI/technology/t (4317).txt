Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making, and translation.  Its conceptual roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, marking a seminal moment in its formalization. Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems. However, limitations in handling complex, real-world data spurred the rise of machine learning (ML) as a dominant subfield.

Machine learning, a subset of AI, utilizes algorithms that allow systems to learn from data without explicit programming. Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and make predictions based on input data.  This shift leveraged advancements in computational power and the availability of large datasets.  Different ML approaches exist, including supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (identifying patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).  The synergy between AI's broader goals and ML's data-driven approach has propelled significant advancements in various domains, from natural language processing to computer vision and robotics.
