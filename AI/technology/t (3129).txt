This presentation offers a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), utilizing accessible analogies to demystify these rapidly evolving fields.  We will explore AI as the overarching ambition – the creation of systems capable of intelligent behavior, akin to building a sophisticated, self-navigating robot capable of diverse tasks.  Machine Learning, a crucial subset of AI, will be explained through the lens of teaching a child: instead of explicitly programming every action, we provide the system (child) with data (experiences) and allow it to learn patterns and make predictions (develop skills) independently.  This process, often involving algorithms like neural networks, can be likened to teaching a dog a trick through reward and punishment; successful predictions are reinforced, unsuccessful ones are adjusted.  We will examine common ML techniques, such as supervised learning (teaching with labelled examples – like showing flashcards), unsupervised learning (exploring data without explicit guidance – like letting a child explore a sandbox), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error – like teaching a dog to fetch). Finally, we will briefly discuss the ethical implications and societal impact of these increasingly pervasive technologies, highlighting the need for responsible development and deployment, analogous to ensuring a well-educated and ethically responsible child contributes positively to society.
