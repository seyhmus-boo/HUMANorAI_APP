Cloud computing, initially conceived as a utility-based service model, has undergone a significant and rapid evolution since its inception. This presentation traces the key stages of this development, from the early adoption of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) characterized by virtualized server offerings, through the emergence of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) enabling streamlined application development and deployment, and culminating in the current prevalence of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) providing on-demand access to software applications. We analyze the driving forces behind this evolution, including advancements in virtualization technologies, increased bandwidth availability, and growing demand for scalability and cost-efficiency.  Furthermore, the presentation explores the impact of emerging technologies such as serverless computing, edge computing, and artificial intelligence on the future trajectory of cloud computing.  We will discuss how these innovations are shaping new paradigms in data management, application architecture, and service delivery, leading to increasingly sophisticated and specialized cloud offerings tailored to diverse business needs.  Finally, we will briefly address the ongoing challenges related to security, privacy, and data sovereignty within the evolving cloud landscape.
