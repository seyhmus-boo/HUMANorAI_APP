Cloud computing's evolution from simple distributed computing to the sophisticated, ubiquitous service it is today has been marked by significant experimental challenges.  Early hurdles revolved around ensuring data security and integrity across distributed, often geographically dispersed, resources.  Maintaining consistent performance and availability while handling unpredictable workloads presented further difficulties, prompting research into resource provisioning and orchestration techniques like virtualization and containerization.  The inherent complexity of managing large-scale distributed systems necessitates robust fault tolerance mechanisms, requiring extensive experimentation to mitigate single points of failure and ensure data resilience.  Moreover, the emergence of serverless computing and edge computing introduces novel challenges related to function execution latency, data locality, and managing diverse hardware ecosystems.  Further experimental work is crucial to address issues of energy efficiency, especially considering the increasing environmental impact of data centers.  Finally, ongoing research focuses on enhancing the security and privacy of cloud-based data, exploring methods for secure multi-party computation and homomorphic encryption to mitigate vulnerabilities inherent in shared infrastructure.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is vital for continued cloud computing innovation and widespread adoption.
