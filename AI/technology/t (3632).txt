The deployment of 5G networks, while promising transformative advancements in technology, has presented significant experimental challenges.  Initial research highlighted difficulties in achieving the advertised speeds and low latency, particularly in dense urban environments where signal propagation is hindered by building materials and interference.  Experimental work focusing on millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, crucial for high bandwidth, encountered issues with atmospheric attenuation and limited range, necessitating dense network deployments and complex beamforming techniques.  Furthermore, ensuring seamless handover between different cells and frequency bands remains a considerable hurdle, leading to potential service disruptions.  The integration of 5G with existing network infrastructure also posed practical challenges, requiring significant upgrades and modifications.  Experimental studies on the impact of 5G on energy consumption have yielded mixed results, highlighting the need for further investigation into energy-efficient network architectures.  Ultimately, while 5G's potential is undeniable, the successful realization of its capabilities necessitates further research to overcome the substantial experimental hurdles detailed above.  Ongoing work is addressing these limitations, but full deployment and widespread benefits require continued refinement and innovation.
