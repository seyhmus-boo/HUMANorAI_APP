Cloud computing, initially conceived as a utility computing model, has undergone a rapid and transformative evolution since its inception. This presentation traces the key phases of this evolution, from early grid computing and virtualisation techniques to the current multi-cloud, serverless, and edge computing paradigms. We will examine the driving forces behind this evolution, including advancements in hardware, software, and networking technologies, as well as changing market demands and user expectations.  Specific focus will be placed on the shift from Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) towards Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), analysing their respective advantages and limitations.  The presentation will also address the emerging trends shaping the future of cloud computing, such as the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in cloud services, enhanced security protocols in response to growing cyber threats, and the sustainability challenges associated with large-scale data centres.  Finally, we will discuss the potential societal implications of this constantly evolving technology, considering its impact on digital equity and global infrastructure.
