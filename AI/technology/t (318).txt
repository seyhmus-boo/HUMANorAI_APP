Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet interconnected technological advancements with burgeoning applications across diverse fields.  While VR's immersive, fully simulated environments have roots in early flight simulators and head-mounted displays of the 1960s,  its widespread accessibility is a relatively recent phenomenon, fueled by advancements in processing power and display technology.  Conversely, AR, which overlays digital information onto the real world, boasts a less immediately apparent history. Early conceptualizations can be traced to Ivan Sutherland's "ultimate display" in the 1960s, a vision that foreshadowed contemporary AR systems. However, its practical realization lagged behind VR due to the greater computational demands of real-time image processing and object recognition. Today,  applications span entertainment, with immersive gaming experiences in VR and interactive advertising in AR; education, employing VR for historical recreations and AR for interactive textbooks; and healthcare, utilizing VR for therapeutic interventions and AR for surgical guidance.  The convergence of these technologies, exemplified by mixed reality (MR), promises even greater transformative potential, blurring the lines between the physical and digital realms.  Continued research into areas such as haptic feedback and improved user interfaces will further expand the range and impact of AR and VR applications.
