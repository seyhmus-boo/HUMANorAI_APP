Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet interconnected advancements in human-computer interaction, rooted in early computer graphics research of the mid-20th century.  Early head-mounted displays, precursors to modern VR headsets, emerged in the 1960s, envisioning immersive environments.  However, technological limitations restricted their impact.  The development of more powerful processors and display technologies in recent decades fueled a resurgence.

VR aims to fully immerse users in synthetic environments, generating a sense of presence through visual, auditory, and sometimes haptic feedback. Applications range from gaming and entertainment to training simulations (e.g., flight simulators) and therapeutic interventions. AR, conversely, overlays computer-generated information onto the real world, enhancing user perception.  Examples include navigation apps utilizing location-based data or medical applications allowing surgeons to visualize internal anatomy during procedures.  Both technologies share a common goal: enhancing human experience and capabilities through sophisticated interaction with digital information.  However, challenges remain, including issues of cost, accessibility, and potential negative consequences like cybersickness and social isolation.
