This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on their practical applications across diverse sectors.  We will begin by differentiating AI and ML, clarifying their respective roles and capabilities within the broader context of computer science.  The core discussion will then explore key ML algorithms, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, highlighting their strengths and limitations in different scenarios.

Practical applications will form the central focus, showcasing the transformative impact of AI/ML in various fields. Examples include advancements in medical diagnosis through image recognition and predictive analytics, optimizing logistical operations via route planning and predictive maintenance, personalized recommendations in e-commerce, and the development of sophisticated natural language processing tools for improved customer service and data analysis.  We will further examine the ethical considerations surrounding AI/ML deployment, such as bias mitigation and ensuring data privacy.  Finally, we will briefly consider future trends and potential challenges in the continued development and implementation of these powerful technologies.
