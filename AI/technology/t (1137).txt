The Internet of Things (IoT) has profoundly impacted the development of smart homes, transforming domestic environments into interconnected ecosystems.  This review examines the practical applications of IoT within this context.  Smart home technology offers enhanced convenience through automated lighting, climate control, and security systems.  IoT-enabled appliances such as smart refrigerators and washing machines provide optimized energy usage and remote monitoring capabilities.  Furthermore, integration with voice assistants facilitates seamless control of multiple devices via intuitive voice commands.  Security benefits are realized through smart locks, surveillance cameras, and intrusion detection systems, offering enhanced home protection and remote monitoring capabilities.  However, the adoption of IoT in smart homes is not without challenges.  Concerns surrounding data privacy, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and interoperability between different platforms require careful consideration.  Despite these limitations, the ongoing development and refinement of IoT technologies are continually expanding the range and efficacy of smart home applications, promising increased convenience, efficiency, and security for residential inhabitants.
