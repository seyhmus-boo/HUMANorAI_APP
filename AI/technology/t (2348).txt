This presentation addresses the experimental challenges inherent in researching the Internet of Things (IoT) within the context of smart homes.  While the promise of interconnected, automated homes is significant, rigorous empirical investigation faces several hurdles.  We highlight three key areas: firstly, the heterogeneity of IoT devices presents significant interoperability issues, demanding complex experimental setups capable of managing diverse communication protocols and data formats. Secondly, ensuring realistic and representative data collection within a home environment poses challenges.  Controlled laboratory settings lack the dynamism of real-world usage, while deploying experiments in actual homes introduces ethical and privacy considerations, along with the logistical difficulties of managing numerous devices and long-term data acquisition. Finally, validating the efficacy and robustness of IoT systems necessitates the development of robust and nuanced evaluation metrics, encompassing aspects such as energy consumption, security vulnerabilities, and user experience, which often interact in complex ways.  This presentation will discuss these challenges, proposing potential solutions and outlining a framework for future experimental designs aimed at enhancing the rigor and generalizability of smart home IoT research.
