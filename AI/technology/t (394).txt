This presentation explores the future trajectory of quantum computing from a foundational quantum mechanical perspective.  We will move beyond the prevalent discussion of algorithmic advancements and technological hurdles to examine the underlying physics limiting scalability and performance.  Specifically, we will address the critical role of decoherence and its mitigation through advanced error correction techniques, focusing on the inherent trade-off between qubit fidelity and connectivity.  Further, we will discuss the potential of novel qubit architectures beyond superconducting and trapped-ion systems, highlighting the unique quantum mechanical properties that offer paths to enhanced coherence times and scalability.  This includes a brief overview of topological qubits and their potential to circumvent decoherence limitations. Finally, we will consider the implications of fundamental quantum mechanical phenomena, such as quantum entanglement and superposition, on the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers and the potential for emergent quantum phenomena in large-scale systems.  The presentation aims to provide a physics-driven perspective on the future challenges and opportunities facing the field, emphasizing the essential link between fundamental quantum mechanics and the realization of practical quantum computers.
