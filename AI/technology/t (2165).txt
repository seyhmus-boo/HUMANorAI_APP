Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science. AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns and relationships in data to improve their performance over time.  This learning process typically involves training the algorithm on a large dataset, allowing it to adjust its internal parameters to minimize errors and optimize its predictive accuracy.  The practical applications of AI and ML are vast and rapidly expanding.  In healthcare, ML algorithms are used for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and personalized medicine.  Finance leverages AI for fraud detection, algorithmic trading, and risk management.  The transportation sector employs AI in autonomous vehicles and traffic optimization systems.  Furthermore, AI powers recommendation systems in e-commerce, enabling personalized product suggestions and targeted advertising.  The continued development and refinement of AI and ML techniques promise further transformative impact across numerous sectors in the coming years.
