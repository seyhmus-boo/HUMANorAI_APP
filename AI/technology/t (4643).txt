The Internet of Things (IoT) promises a revolution in domestic living, with smart homes leveraging interconnected devices to enhance convenience, security, and energy efficiency.  However, realizing the full potential of this vision is hampered by significant experimental challenges. This paper investigates the key obstacles encountered in researching and developing IoT-enabled smart home environments.  These challenges span multiple domains, including data acquisition and management from heterogeneous devices often operating under varied and unpredictable network conditions.  The complexity of integrating disparate protocols and ensuring interoperability between devices from different manufacturers presents a major hurdle.  Furthermore, experimental validation of proposed algorithms and architectures requires robust and scalable testbeds capable of simulating real-world scenarios, including network latency, device failures, and security threats.  This paper examines the limitations of existing methodologies for evaluating IoT performance in smart home settings, focusing specifically on the challenges related to data reproducibility, scalability, and the creation of realistic and controlled experimental conditions.  Addressing these challenges is crucial for accelerating the development and widespread adoption of truly effective and dependable smart home technologies.
