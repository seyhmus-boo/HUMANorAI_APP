Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the broad field of creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  Its historical roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, marking the formal inception of the field. Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and problem-solving through handcrafted rules. However, limitations in scalability and adaptability led to a shift towards data-driven approaches.

Machine learning (ML), a subfield of AI, emerged as a powerful solution.  ML algorithms learn patterns from data rather than relying on explicit programming. This paradigm shift leveraged advancements in computing power and the availability of large datasets.  Different ML approaches exist, including supervised learning (learning from labeled data), unsupervised learning (finding patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).  

The synergistic relationship between AI and ML is evident: ML provides the tools for building intelligent systems, while AI frames the overarching goal of creating intelligent agents.  Recent advancements in deep learning, a subset of ML utilizing artificial neural networks, have propelled AI into new realms of capability, impacting various sectors from healthcare to finance.  However, ethical considerations regarding bias, transparency, and accountability remain crucial areas of ongoing research.
