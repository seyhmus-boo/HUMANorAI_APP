This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on their practical applications across diverse sectors.  We will define core concepts, distinguishing between AI's broader scope encompassing intelligent agents and ML's focus on algorithms that learn from data.  The presentation will explore key ML paradigms including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, illustrating their distinct methodologies and suitability for different problem types.  We will then examine impactful applications, showcasing examples such as image recognition in medical diagnostics (e.g., cancer detection), natural language processing in customer service chatbots, and predictive maintenance in manufacturing using sensor data analysis.  Furthermore, the ethical implications of AI/ML deployment, including bias in algorithms and data privacy concerns, will be briefly addressed.  Finally, we will discuss future trends and potential challenges in the field, emphasizing the ongoing need for robust theoretical advancements and responsible development practices.  The presentation aims to provide attendees with a foundational understanding of AI/ML and its transformative potential across industries.
