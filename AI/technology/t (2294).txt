The Internet of Things (IoT) is rapidly transforming residential environments, creating the foundation for smart homes.  This paper summarizes the key technological advancements and societal implications of IoT integration within domestic settings.  Smart home systems leverage interconnected devices, encompassing sensors, actuators, and computing units, to automate and optimize various aspects of home management, from energy consumption and security to entertainment and appliance control.  Data aggregation and analysis through cloud-based platforms enable personalized automation and predictive maintenance, enhancing convenience and efficiency.  However, the proliferation of IoT devices raises critical concerns regarding data privacy, security vulnerabilities, and the potential for algorithmic bias in personalized services.  Existing research highlights the need for robust cybersecurity protocols and ethical guidelines to mitigate these risks. Future research should focus on developing interoperable standards, enhancing user control over data sharing, and addressing the broader societal impact of ubiquitous computing within the domestic sphere, considering issues of accessibility and digital equity.  The ultimate success of smart homes hinges on balancing technological innovation with responsible implementation and user empowerment.
