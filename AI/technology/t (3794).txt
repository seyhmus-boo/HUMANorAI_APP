Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly expanding beyond entertainment, demonstrating significant interdisciplinary potential.  Their convergence necessitates collaboration across computer science, engineering, psychology, and design.  Computer scientists develop the core technologies, including 3D modelling, tracking, and rendering, while engineers refine hardware like head-mounted displays and haptic feedback systems.  Crucially, psychological research informs the design of user interfaces, ensuring intuitive navigation and minimizing simulator sickness in VR.  Human-computer interaction (HCI) expertise is paramount in creating immersive and engaging experiences that cater to diverse user needs and cognitive capabilities.  Furthermore, industrial design principles play a key role in optimizing ergonomics and aesthetics, impacting user acceptance and overall effectiveness.  These interdisciplinary linkages are crucial for the successful development and implementation of AR/VR across sectors, from healthcare and education to manufacturing and architecture, where simulations and interactive training offer transformative possibilities.  Future advancements will rely heavily on continued interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration.
