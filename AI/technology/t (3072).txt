This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, highlighting their significant potential across diverse disciplines.  While initially conceived within computer science and engineering, AR/VR technologies are rapidly transcending these boundaries, fostering interdisciplinary collaborations with profound implications.  We examine the synergistic relationship between AR/VR and fields such as medicine (surgical simulations, therapeutic interventions), education (immersive learning experiences, historical reconstructions), architecture (virtual walkthroughs, design visualization), and the arts (interactive installations, immersive storytelling).  The presentation will analyze specific case studies illustrating how these interdisciplinary partnerships drive innovation, focusing on both the methodological challenges and the remarkable opportunities presented by these technologies.  We argue that the successful integration of AR/VR necessitates a holistic approach, demanding collaboration between technologists, subject matter experts, and human factors specialists to address issues of usability, accessibility, and ethical considerations.  The ultimate goal is to showcase the transformative power of AR/VR when leveraged through genuine interdisciplinary engagement.
