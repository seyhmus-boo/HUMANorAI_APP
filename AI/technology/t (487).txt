Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), while often used interchangeably, represent distinct yet intertwined fields within computer science. This paper explores the conceptual foundations and practical applications of both, highlighting their historical development and current trajectory.  The genesis of AI can be traced back to the Dartmouth Workshop of 1956, where the term was coined and ambitious goals for creating truly intelligent machines were established. Early efforts focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, aiming to replicate human cognitive processes through explicit programming.  However, these approaches encountered limitations in handling complex, real-world data.  The subsequent rise of ML, particularly with the advent of readily available computational power and large datasets, offered a more data-driven approach.  Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns and make predictions from data, enabling applications ranging from image recognition and natural language processing to predictive analytics and robotics. This paper will analyze the key distinctions between AI and ML, examining prominent algorithms and their impact across diverse sectors, while also discussing the ethical and societal implications of this rapidly evolving technological landscape.
