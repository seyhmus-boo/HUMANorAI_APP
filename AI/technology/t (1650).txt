Quantum computing, a paradigm shift in computation leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena, holds immense promise for revolutionizing various fields.  However, the transition from theoretical breakthroughs to practical, large-scale quantum computers remains fraught with significant experimental challenges. This paper focuses on the critical experimental hurdles hindering the realization of fault-tolerant, scalable quantum computers.  We examine the limitations imposed by qubit coherence times, emphasizing the need for improved qubit designs and environmental control techniques to mitigate decoherence.  Furthermore, the scalability problem, concerning the reliable fabrication and control of an exponentially increasing number of qubits while maintaining sufficient connectivity, will be addressed.  We will discuss the current landscape of different qubit modalities, including superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and photonic systems, analyzing their respective strengths and weaknesses regarding coherence, scalability, and gate fidelity.  Finally, we will explore the ongoing research efforts to develop error correction codes and fault-tolerant architectures, crucial for building robust and reliable quantum computers capable of surpassing classical capabilities.  This analysis aims to highlight the key experimental roadblocks and promising avenues of research toward achieving the long-sought future of practical quantum computing.
