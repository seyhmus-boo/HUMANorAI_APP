This presentation offers a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), utilizing relatable analogies to demystify these rapidly evolving fields.  AI, in its broadest sense, can be likened to a human expert system – capable of performing tasks requiring intelligence, such as problem-solving or decision-making.  However, unlike a human expert who relies on explicit programming, AI often leverages ML.  Imagine ML as a child learning to ride a bicycle:  initially, it’s clumsy, making mistakes and requiring guidance (training data). Through repeated attempts and adjustments based on feedback (algorithms), the child (ML model) improves its balance and skill, eventually mastering the task without explicit instruction. This iterative learning process, driven by data analysis and algorithmic refinement, allows ML models to identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance over time.  We will explore key differences between supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, using further analogies to illustrate the unique characteristics and applications of each paradigm.  Ultimately, this presentation aims to provide a foundational understanding of AI and ML, facilitating informed discussion of their potential and limitations across various disciplines.
