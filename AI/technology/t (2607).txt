Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are inextricably linked yet distinct concepts.  AI, the broader field, aims to create systems capable of mimicking human cognitive functions, such as problem-solving and learning.  Think of AI as the ambitious blueprint for a self-driving car – the overall goal of autonomous navigation.  Machine learning, a subset of AI, provides the engine for this ambition.  Instead of explicitly programming every driving scenario, ML allows the car to learn from data – countless hours of driving simulations and real-world data – identifying patterns and making predictions to optimize its performance.  This learning process is analogous to a child learning to ride a bicycle:  initial attempts are clumsy, but through repeated trials and adjustments based on feedback (e.g., falling, correcting balance), the child gradually masters the skill.  Similarly, ML algorithms refine their performance through iterative exposure to data, adjusting internal parameters to minimize errors.  Deep learning, a more advanced form of ML, further refines this process by employing artificial neural networks, inspired by the structure of the human brain, to analyze complex data structures, akin to a highly specialized brain region focusing on a specific task like object recognition.  The synergy between AI's overarching goals and ML's data-driven approach fuels advancements across numerous sectors.
