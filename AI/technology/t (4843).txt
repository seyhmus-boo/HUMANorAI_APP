Cloud computing's evolution can be understood through the lens of resource allocation. Initially, computing power resembled a private, on-site power generator: expensive, inefficient, and limited to the owner's needs (on-premise infrastructure).  The advent of virtualization, akin to building multiple apartments within a single building, allowed for greater resource sharing and efficiency.  This marked the shift towards the "utility computing" model, where computing resources are provided like electricityâ€”consumed as needed, without managing the underlying infrastructure.

This utility model evolved further, mirroring the development of electricity grids from localized generators to national networks.  The cloud, now a vast interconnected network of data centers, provides scalable and elastic resources on demand, mirroring the flexibility of a national grid.  The emergence of serverless computing represents a further refinement, comparable to a sophisticated smart grid that anticipates and adjusts power distribution automatically, abstracting away even the management of individual servers.  This continuous evolution drives increasing efficiency, scalability, and accessibility, transforming how individuals and organizations access and utilize computing power.
