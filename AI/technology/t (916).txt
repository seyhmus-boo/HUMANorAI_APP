The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) promises a transformative impact on transportation, yet significant experimental challenges remain before widespread deployment is feasible. This presentation will focus on key experimental hurdles hindering the realization of fully autonomous driving.  We will examine the limitations of current sensor technologies, particularly in adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, snow, and fog, highlighting the need for robust sensor fusion techniques capable of reliable perception under such constraints.  Furthermore, we will discuss the complexities of developing accurate and robust prediction models for the behaviour of unpredictable human actors, including pedestrians and cyclists, within diverse and dynamic traffic environments.  The challenges associated with ethically sound decision-making in unavoidable accident scenarios will also be addressed, underscoring the necessity for developing and validating ethical frameworks for AVs. Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the scalability of testing and validation methodologies required to ensure the safety and reliability of AVs before their public release, highlighting the need for sophisticated simulation environments and rigorous real-world testing protocols.  Overall, this presentation aims to provide an overview of the critical experimental challenges that must be addressed to pave the way for the safe and effective integration of AVs into society.
