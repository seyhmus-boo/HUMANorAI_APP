Big data analytics has rapidly transformed modern industries, offering unprecedented opportunities for optimization and innovation. However, the application of big data methodologies presents significant experimental challenges. This abstract examines these challenges, focusing on three key areas: data quality and pre-processing, model selection and validation, and the interpretability and explainability of results.  High-dimensional, noisy, and heterogeneous datasets necessitate robust pre-processing techniques, often requiring computationally expensive procedures and careful consideration of bias introduction.  Furthermore, the vastness of big data necessitates the exploration of numerous model architectures, demanding sophisticated automated model selection strategies and rigorous cross-validation methods capable of handling imbalanced datasets and mitigating overfitting. Finally, the complex nature of many big data models often sacrifices interpretability, hindering practical implementation and trust in results.  Addressing these challenges – developing efficient pre-processing methods, establishing reliable model selection procedures, and developing techniques for enhancing model transparency – is crucial for the successful and ethical deployment of big data analytics across diverse industries. Future research should prioritize the development of standardized benchmarks and robust evaluation metrics to facilitate progress in these crucial areas.
