This presentation explores the intersection of quantum mechanics and the burgeoning field of smart homes within the Internet of Things (IoT). While seemingly disparate, these domains share underlying principles of information processing and control.  Current IoT devices rely on classical computation, limiting their efficiency and security.  We posit that leveraging quantum mechanical phenomena could revolutionize smart home technology.  This abstract proposes a preliminary framework for analyzing the potential of quantum computing and quantum communication protocols in enhancing smart home functionalities. We will discuss how quantum key distribution (QKD) could enhance the security of data transmitted between IoT devices, mitigating vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.  Furthermore, we will explore the potential of quantum algorithms for optimizing energy management within the smart home, leading to improved efficiency and reduced environmental impact.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the challenges and future research directions necessary to integrate quantum technologies into the existing smart home infrastructure, including the development of robust and scalable quantum devices suitable for integration into home environments.  The ultimate goal is to pave the way towards truly secure and efficient quantum-enhanced smart homes.
