This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), emphasizing its increasingly significant interdisciplinary connections.  While traditionally rooted in computer science and mathematics, AI/ML's impact transcends these disciplines, fostering collaborations with diverse fields and generating transformative applications.  We will examine key interdisciplinary links, including the application of ML algorithms in bioinformatics for drug discovery and personalized medicine, the use of AI in social sciences for analyzing large datasets and predicting social trends, and the integration of AI in the humanities for text analysis and historical research.  Furthermore, the ethical considerations arising from these collaborations will be addressed, highlighting the importance of interdisciplinary dialogue in navigating challenges related to bias, transparency, and accountability.  This presentation argues that the future of AI/ML relies heavily on robust interdisciplinary partnerships, enabling the development of responsible and impactful solutions to complex real-world problems across a wide range of sectors. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of promising avenues for future interdisciplinary research in AI/ML.
