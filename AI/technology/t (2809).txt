This presentation explores the intersection of the Internet of Things (IoT) and smart homes, examining their evolution and contemporary significance.  The concept of automated home environments has roots in early automation technologies of the mid-20th century, with individual appliances gaining rudimentary control systems. However, the true emergence of the "smart home" is inextricably linked to the proliferation of the internet and the development of affordable, interconnected devices. This shift, marked by the rise of IoT in the late 2000s, facilitated the creation of integrated systems managing diverse household functions, from lighting and temperature control to security and entertainment.  We will analyze the technological advancements that underpin this convergence, including advancements in embedded systems, wireless communication protocols (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave, Wi-Fi), and data analytics.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the societal implications of pervasive IoT in the domestic sphere, addressing both the benefits – increased energy efficiency, enhanced security, and personalized comfort – and potential challenges, encompassing data privacy concerns, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and issues of accessibility and digital inequality.  Finally, future trends and research directions in this rapidly evolving field will be briefly considered.
