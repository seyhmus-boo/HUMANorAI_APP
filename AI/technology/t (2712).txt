The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly impacted the development of smart homes, transforming residences into interconnected ecosystems managed via digital interfaces.  This review examines the practical applications and implications of this convergence.  Smart home technology leverages IoT devices to automate various functionalities, enhancing convenience and efficiency.  Examples include smart thermostats optimizing energy consumption, intelligent lighting systems adjusting to ambient conditions and user preferences, and security systems employing interconnected sensors and cameras for enhanced surveillance.  Furthermore, integration of IoT appliances allows for remote control and monitoring of devices such as refrigerators, washing machines, and ovens, leading to optimized resource management and reduced energy waste.  While offering substantial benefits, challenges remain.  Concerns regarding data privacy, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and the potential for technological dependence require careful consideration.  Future research should focus on mitigating these risks through robust security protocols and user-centric design principles to fully realize the transformative potential of IoT in the smart home domain.
