Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). While seemingly novel, their conceptual roots extend back to the mid-20th century, with Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) representing a pioneering, albeit rudimentary, VR system.  However, technological limitations constrained early development.  The advent of more powerful computing and display technologies in recent decades has fueled an explosion of applications.

AR, overlaying digital information onto the real world, finds utility in various sectors.  From interactive gaming and navigation systems to medical training and industrial design, AR facilitates intuitive and immersive experiences.  In contrast, VR creates entirely simulated environments, completely immersing the user.  Applications range from therapeutic interventions for phobias to architectural visualization and immersive entertainment, offering unparalleled levels of engagement.  Despite ongoing challenges related to cost, accessibility, and potential negative impacts on user well-being, the future trajectory of both AR and VR points towards increasingly sophisticated and pervasive integration into our lives.
