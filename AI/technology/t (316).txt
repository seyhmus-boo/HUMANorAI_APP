Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications offer transformative potential across diverse fields, yet their widespread adoption is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  This abstract highlights key methodological limitations in evaluating these technologies.  Firstly, the inherent subjectivity of user experience presents difficulties in quantifying effects, necessitating robust methodologies beyond simple questionnaires, such as physiological measures and eye-tracking.  Secondly, the development of ecologically valid experimental paradigms remains a hurdle.  Simulations often lack the richness and complexity of real-world situations, limiting the generalizability of findings.  Thirdly, the technical variability between AR/VR systems, including display resolution, latency, and tracking accuracy, introduces confounding factors requiring careful standardization and control across experiments. Finally, ethical considerations, such as motion sickness prevalence and the potential for cognitive overload, demand rigorous participant screening and careful data interpretation.  Addressing these methodological challenges through the development of standardized protocols, improved technological infrastructure, and ethically sound experimental designs is crucial for advancing the field and ensuring the responsible implementation of AR/VR technologies.
