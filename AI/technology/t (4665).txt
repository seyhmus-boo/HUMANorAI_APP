The burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) are rapidly transforming human interaction with digital information, impacting diverse sectors from entertainment and education to healthcare and engineering.  While traditionally analyzed through the lens of computer science and human-computer interaction, this research explores the potential for a quantum mechanical perspective to inform the development and optimization of AR/VR applications.  This approach is motivated by the inherent limitations of classical computation in handling the complexity of realistic simulations and the increasing need for efficient processing of vast datasets required for immersive experiences.  Specifically, we examine the potential applications of quantum algorithms in accelerating rendering processes, improving realistic physics simulation, and enhancing the fidelity of haptic feedback.  Furthermore, we investigate the potential use of quantum entanglement for achieving seamless integration between the physical and virtual worlds, thereby enhancing the sense of presence and immersion in AR/VR environments.  This paper will delve into the theoretical foundations and explore specific examples to demonstrate the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating quantum mechanical principles into the design and implementation of future AR/VR technologies.
