Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has evolved significantly since its inception.  Early forms, primarily characterized by utility computing models, offered basic infrastructure as a service (IaaS). This involved the outsourcing of server space and storage, a rudimentary precursor to the sophisticated offerings of today.  The evolution has witnessed a progression from simple virtual machine provisioning to the emergence of platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a service (SaaS). PaaS provides development environments and deployment tools, abstracting away much of the underlying infrastructure. SaaS delivers complete applications accessible via the internet, maximizing user accessibility and minimizing maintenance burdens.  Concurrent advancements in virtualization, containerization, and distributed systems architecture have fuelled this growth, enabling greater scalability, efficiency, and resilience.  Furthermore, the rise of serverless computing and edge computing represents the latest frontier, pushing the boundaries of cloud capabilities and deployment models towards even more dynamic and decentralized approaches.  Future research will focus on addressing security concerns and optimizing resource allocation within these increasingly complex ecosystems.
