This presentation explores emerging cybersecurity challenges exacerbated by the imminent advent of quantum computing, and potential solutions rooted in quantum mechanics itself.  While quantum computers promise unprecedented computational power, they also pose a significant threat to current cryptographic systems reliant on the difficulty of factoring large numbers or solving discrete logarithm problems â€“ problems easily solvable by sufficiently powerful quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm.  This necessitates a transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC).

We examine the landscape of PQC algorithms, focusing on lattice-based, code-based, and multivariate cryptography, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in terms of security, performance, and implementation complexity.  Furthermore, we discuss the potential of quantum key distribution (QKD) as a secure method for exchanging cryptographic keys, leveraging the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics to guarantee unconditional security.  However, practical challenges associated with QKD deployment, including distance limitations and vulnerability to side-channel attacks, will be addressed.  Finally, we will briefly explore the burgeoning field of quantum-resistant hardware, investigating its potential to enhance overall system security against both classical and quantum attacks.  The presentation concludes by outlining critical research areas crucial for securing the future digital landscape in the quantum era.
