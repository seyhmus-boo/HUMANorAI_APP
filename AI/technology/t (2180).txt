Good morning. Today's lecture will explore the intertwined fields of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML).  AI, conceptually dating back to Alan Turing's seminal work in the 1950s, encompasses the broad goal of creating machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence.  Early AI research focused on symbolic reasoning and expert systems, aiming to codify human knowledge into explicit rules.

However, the limitations of this approach became apparent.  This paved the way for the rise of ML, a subset of AI focusing on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  This paradigm shift, fueled by increasing computational power and the availability of vast datasets, has yielded remarkable progress in recent decades.  ML algorithms, employing techniques like deep learning and neural networks, are now driving breakthroughs in areas such as image recognition, natural language processing, and robotics.  While AI represents the overarching ambition, ML provides the crucial methodology for achieving many of its goals.  The synergistic relationship between these two fields continues to shape technological advancements across numerous disciplines.
