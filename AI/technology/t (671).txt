Blockchain technology, initially conceived for cryptocurrency, has evolved into a versatile distributed ledger technology with diverse applications beyond finance.  This presentation will explore the fundamental principles of blockchain, including decentralization, immutability, and transparency, and discuss how these characteristics underpin its applicability across various sectors.  We will examine practical implementations, focusing on three key areas: supply chain management, where blockchain enhances traceability and combats counterfeiting; healthcare, where secure and verifiable patient data management is facilitated; and digital identity, addressing challenges of identity theft and fraudulent activities through self-sovereign identity solutions.  The presentation will also briefly analyze the limitations and challenges of implementing blockchain technologies, including scalability issues, regulatory uncertainty, and energy consumption. Finally, we will consider future prospects and emerging trends, highlighting the potential of blockchain to revolutionize data management and foster trust in increasingly digitalized environments.
