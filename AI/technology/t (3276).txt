The burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) present significant experimental challenges despite their rapid technological advancements.  A key hurdle lies in achieving seamless integration between the real and virtual worlds in AR.  Developing robust tracking and registration systems that accurately overlay digital content onto real-world environments remains problematic, particularly in dynamic scenarios with varying lighting conditions and occlusions.  Similarly, VR applications struggle with issues of presence and immersion, with simulator sickness and motion discomfort hindering prolonged usage.  Precisely modelling human-computer interaction (HCI) within these immersive environments necessitates rigorous experimentation to optimise interface design and minimise cognitive load.  Furthermore, the ethical implications of VR, such as potential for addiction or desensitization to violence, require extensive experimental investigation.  Finally, the accessibility of AR/VR technologies is a crucial factor, with research needed to address issues of cost, hardware limitations, and the development of inclusive design principles to cater to diverse user needs and abilities.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is essential for unlocking the full potential of AR/VR applications across various sectors.
