Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are inextricably linked fields within computer science, focusing on the creation of systems capable of mimicking human intelligence.  Early AI, dating back to the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, aimed at symbolic reasoning and problem-solving through explicitly programmed rules.  This "symbolic AI" encountered limitations in handling complex, real-world data.

The rise of big data and increased computational power fueled the resurgence of AI through ML.  ML, a subset of AI, utilizes algorithms that allow systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Instead of relying on pre-defined rules, ML algorithms identify patterns, make predictions, and improve their performance through iterative training on datasets.  This paradigm shift led to breakthroughs in areas like image recognition, natural language processing, and predictive analytics.  

Supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning represent distinct ML approaches, each with specific applications and challenges. While AI's ultimate goal remains the creation of general-purpose intelligence, current advancements in ML demonstrate significant progress towards building specialized AI systems with transformative potential across various sectors.  However, ethical considerations surrounding bias, transparency, and accountability remain crucial areas of ongoing research and debate.
