Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet related advancements in human-computer interaction, tracing their conceptual origins to the mid-20th century.  Early explorations, such as Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957), foreshadowed VR's immersive potential by simulating sensory experiences.  However, technological limitations hindered widespread adoption until recent decades.  AR, conversely, emerged more gradually, with Ivan Sutherland's "ultimate display" (1968) proposing a system overlaying computer-generated imagery onto the real world.

The proliferation of powerful mobile computing and advanced display technologies has propelled both AR and VR into mainstream applications.  AR, through applications like Pokemon Go and heads-up displays, enhances the real world by superimposing digital information.  VR, utilizing headsets and motion tracking, creates entirely synthetic environments, finding utility in gaming, training simulations, and therapeutic interventions.  Despite their differences, both technologies share the common goal of mediating human perception and interaction with the environment, albeit through contrasting approaches. Continued research focuses on enhancing immersion, improving realism, and exploring novel applications across diverse fields.
