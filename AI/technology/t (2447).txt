Blockchain technology, initially conceived as the foundation for cryptocurrencies, has rapidly evolved into a versatile platform with transformative potential across diverse sectors.  This presentation offers an overview of blockchain's core functionalities, focusing on its decentralized, transparent, and immutable nature.  We will examine the cryptographic principles underpinning its security and explore its key attributes – consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and distributed ledger technology – which enable novel applications.  

Beyond cryptocurrencies, practical applications are burgeoning.  We will highlight examples demonstrating blockchain's utility in supply chain management, enhancing traceability and combating counterfeiting.  Furthermore, its potential in secure digital identity verification, facilitating streamlined processes for KYC/AML compliance and reducing identity theft, will be explored. The application of blockchain in healthcare, specifically for secure data sharing and patient record management, and its potential to enhance voting systems will also be discussed.  Finally, the presentation will address the challenges and limitations of widespread blockchain adoption, including scalability, regulatory hurdles, and energy consumption.
