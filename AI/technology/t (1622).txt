Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR). While seemingly novel, their conceptual roots stretch back to the mid-20th century, with Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) representing an early, albeit rudimentary, attempt at immersive virtual environments.  Subsequent decades witnessed iterative advancements, culminating in the development of head-mounted displays and sophisticated tracking systems.

AR, overlaying digital information onto the real world, found early applications in military and industrial contexts.  Think heads-up displays in fighter jets.  Contemporary AR manifests in applications like Pokémon Go, showcasing the technology’s accessibility and entertainment potential.  VR, conversely, creates entirely simulated environments, offering experiences ranging from gaming and interactive storytelling to architectural visualization and medical training.

The convergence of powerful computing, sophisticated sensors, and affordable hardware has propelled both AR and VR into mainstream consciousness. However, challenges remain, including the resolution of motion sickness in VR, the refinement of AR’s spatial accuracy, and the ethical implications of increasingly immersive and persuasive technologies.  Further research is crucial to address these issues and unlock the full potential of these transformative mediums.
