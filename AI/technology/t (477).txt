Good morning. Today's lecture will examine the applications of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).  While seemingly novel, their conceptual roots stretch back to the mid-20th century.  Early examples, like Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957), foreshadowed VR's immersive potential, albeit with limited technological capability.  The development of head-mounted displays and advancements in computer graphics gradually propelled the field forward.

Currently, AR and VR find applications across diverse sectors.  AR, overlaying digital information onto the real world, is utilized in gaming (Pok√©mon Go), industrial maintenance (overlaying instructions onto machinery), and medical training (simulated surgeries).  Conversely, VR, creating entirely simulated environments, dominates fields like gaming, architectural visualization, and therapeutic interventions for phobias.  Furthermore, the convergence of AR and VR, often termed Mixed Reality (MR), promises even more sophisticated applications, blurring the lines between the physical and digital realms.  Future research will focus on refining these technologies' accessibility, affordability, and integration within everyday life.
