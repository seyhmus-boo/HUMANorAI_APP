While seemingly disparate, augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications hold subtle yet intriguing links to quantum mechanics.  Current implementations rely on classical computational frameworks, but future advancements may leverage quantum principles.  For instance, the high-fidelity rendering crucial for immersive VR experiences could benefit from quantum computing's potential for exponentially faster processing of complex visual data, particularly in simulating realistic physics and light interactions.  Quantum random number generators (QRNGs) could enhance the realism and unpredictability of VR environments, moving beyond deterministic algorithms to create truly stochastic simulations.  

Furthermore, quantum communication protocols, such as quantum key distribution (QKD), could secure the transmission of sensitive data within AR/VR systems, addressing concerns surrounding user privacy and data security.  Quantum sensors could enable more accurate tracking and spatial awareness, crucial for precise overlaying of digital information in AR or realistic navigation in VR.  Although presently theoretical, quantum entanglement could, in principle, facilitate seamless integration between virtual and real worlds by enabling instantaneous communication between distant components of a hybrid AR/VR system.  Therefore, while current AR/VR applications rely on classical physics, the future trajectory of these technologies is deeply intertwined with the advancements in quantum information science.
