This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications.  While current AR/VR technologies primarily rely on classical computation, we argue that leveraging quantum phenomena offers significant potential for enhancing realism, efficiency, and functionality.  We will discuss the theoretical possibilities of quantum-enhanced rendering, focusing on the potential for superior image generation and manipulation through quantum algorithms addressing problems like ray tracing and scene rendering, currently bottlenecked by classical computational limits.  Furthermore, we will examine the application of quantum computing to advanced haptic feedback, enabling more nuanced and realistic interactions within simulated environments.  The development of quantum random number generators (QRNGs) could also revolutionize AR/VR by providing truly unpredictable and secure data for immersive experiences and user authentication.  Finally, we will address the challenges associated with developing quantum-enhanced AR/VR, including the limitations of current quantum hardware and the need for novel algorithms tailored to these specific applications. This exploration will highlight the potential for a quantum leap in the immersive technological landscape.
