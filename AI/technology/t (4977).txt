Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, presenting significant opportunities across diverse sectors. This abstract explores the current applications and future potential of AR and VR, highlighting their distinct capabilities.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception and interaction, with applications ranging from interactive gaming and industrial maintenance (e.g., remote expert assistance) to medical training and retail experiences.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, offering powerful tools for simulation, training, and therapeutic interventions.  Examples include flight simulators, surgical rehearsals, and the treatment of phobias.  While both technologies offer significant advantages, challenges remain, including issues of cost, accessibility, user experience design, and potential negative impacts such as motion sickness and cognitive overload.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations, exploring the integration of AR and VR with other technologies like artificial intelligence and haptics, and investigating the long-term effects of immersive technologies on human cognition and behaviour.  The continued development and refinement of AR and VR promise transformative advancements across numerous fields.
