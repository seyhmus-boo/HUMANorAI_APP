This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) applications, moving beyond theoretical considerations to highlight their practical impact across diverse sectors.  We will examine the key technological distinctions between AR, which overlays digital information onto the real world, and VR, which creates immersive, simulated environments.  The presentation will showcase successful implementations, including the use of AR in medical training – facilitating realistic surgical simulations and anatomical exploration – and in industrial maintenance, where AR overlays can guide technicians through complex repairs.  Furthermore, we will discuss VR's applications in architectural visualization, allowing clients to experience building designs before construction, and in therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD, providing controlled exposure therapy environments.  Finally, we will briefly address the ethical considerations and potential challenges associated with the widespread adoption of these technologies, focusing on accessibility, data privacy, and the potential for social isolation.  The overall aim is to provide a concise overview of the current state of AR and VR applications and their rapidly evolving potential for societal transformation.
