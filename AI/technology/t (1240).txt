Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications represent a convergence of numerous disciplines, fostering interdisciplinary innovation.  Their development relies heavily on computer science, encompassing areas like 3D graphics rendering, computer vision for object recognition and tracking in AR, and human-computer interaction (HCI) for designing intuitive interfaces.  Psychology plays a crucial role in understanding user experience, including motion sickness in VR and cognitive load management in both AR and VR environments.  Engineering contributes to the design and miniaturization of hardware, from head-mounted displays and sensors to haptic feedback devices.  Furthermore, design thinking informs the aesthetic and usability of applications, ensuring accessibility and engaging user experiences.  Specific application areas, such as medical training (using VR surgical simulations) or architectural visualization (employing AR for building walkthroughs), further necessitate collaboration with relevant fields like medicine and architecture.  The interdisciplinary nature of AR/VR ensures continuous development and broadening applications across diverse sectors.
