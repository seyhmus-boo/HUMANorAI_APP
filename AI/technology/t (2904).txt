Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, finding increasing applications across diverse sectors.  Recent advancements focus on enhancing user experience and expanding functionality.  In AR, advancements in computer vision and sensor technology facilitate more robust object recognition and environment mapping, enabling seamless integration of digital content with the real world.  This is exemplified by improved markerless tracking and the rise of context-aware AR applications.  Simultaneously, VR is witnessing progress in display technology, with higher resolutions and refresh rates mitigating motion sickness and enhancing immersion.  Haptic feedback systems are becoming more sophisticated, providing users with a greater sense of touch and presence within virtual environments.  Furthermore, advancements in cloud computing facilitate the delivery of increasingly complex and data-intensive AR/VR experiences.  The convergence of these technologies, coupled with advancements in artificial intelligence, is driving the development of more interactive, personalized, and intuitive applications in fields such as healthcare, education, engineering, and entertainment, promising transformative impacts across various domains.  Future research should focus on addressing limitations in computational power, accessibility, and user safety to further realize the full potential of these technologies.
