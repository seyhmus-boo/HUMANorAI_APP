Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct but related advancements in human-computer interaction, tracing their conceptual roots to early simulations and head-mounted displays in the mid-20th century.  While Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) foreshadowed VR's immersive potential, the technological limitations of the era hindered widespread adoption.  The development of more powerful computing resources and display technologies in recent decades has facilitated a surge in both AR and VR applications.

AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  Applications range from interactive gaming and navigation to medical training and industrial design, offering benefits through contextualized data presentation and improved user engagement.  Conversely, VR generates entirely synthetic environments, immersing users in simulated realities via headsets.  This technology finds applications in gaming, simulation training (e.g., flight simulators, surgical practice), and therapeutic interventions for phobias or PTSD.  While currently experiencing rapid development, both AR and VR face ongoing challenges regarding technological limitations, cost, and the potential for negative effects on user well-being.  Future advancements are likely to focus on enhancing realism, improving accessibility, and addressing ethical concerns.
