The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) presents a compelling case study in the interplay between macroscopic classical systems and the underlying quantum mechanical principles governing their constituent components. While AV functionality relies primarily on classical computation and control systems, their performance fundamentally depends on the quantum mechanical behavior of materials within sensors, processors, and actuators.  This abstract explores the quantum mechanical underpinnings of AV technology, focusing on three key areas: (1)  the quantum nature of light in LiDAR and camera sensors, crucial for environmental perception; the efficiency and precision of these sensors are directly linked to the quantum efficiency of photodetectors and the wave-particle duality of light. (2) The quantum mechanical limitations on the miniaturization and power consumption of microprocessors and memory units that govern AV decision-making; the scaling limits imposed by quantum effects like tunneling and electron-phonon interactions constrain the speed and efficiency of computation. (3)  The quantum mechanics of materials science influencing the reliability and durability of actuators and other mechanical components, impacting safety and longevity.  Investigating these quantum effects offers a unique perspective on technological advancements, revealing both the enabling possibilities and inherent limitations governing the future of AV development and deployment.  Further research is necessary to fully characterize and optimize these quantum-level contributions to ensure the safe and efficient operation of autonomous vehicles.
