This presentation explores the multifaceted cybersecurity challenges of the modern digital landscape and highlights the critical need for interdisciplinary solutions.  The pervasive nature of cyber threats, ranging from sophisticated state-sponsored attacks to everyday phishing scams, demands a response that transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. We argue that effective cybersecurity necessitates a synergistic approach integrating expertise from computer science, law, social sciences, and even the humanities.  

The presentation will examine specific challenges, including the ethical implications of AI in cybersecurity, the legal frameworks struggling to keep pace with technological advancements, and the persistent human factor in security breachesâ€”a topic requiring insights from psychology and sociology. We will then analyze successful examples of interdisciplinary collaboration in addressing these challenges, such as the development of human-centered security designs and the application of social network analysis to identify and mitigate online threats. Finally, the presentation will advocate for a more integrated, interdisciplinary approach to cybersecurity education and research to foster innovative solutions and proactively address the evolving threat landscape.  This necessitates breaking down siloed thinking and fostering collaborative research environments across disciplines.
