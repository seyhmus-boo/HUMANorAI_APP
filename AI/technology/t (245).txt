The future of quantum computing hinges not solely on advancements in physics, but on robust interdisciplinary collaboration.  While the development of more stable qubits and error correction codes remains crucial within the physics and engineering domains,  significant progress depends on breakthroughs in other fields.  Computer science will be central, devising new algorithms and architectures optimized for quantum hardware's unique capabilities.  Furthermore, advancements in materials science are paramount for developing novel qubit materials with enhanced coherence times.  Mathematics, particularly in areas like linear algebra and topology, provides the theoretical framework for quantum algorithms and error mitigation.  Crucially, the societal implications, addressed by ethicists and social scientists, will determine responsible development and deployment, mitigating potential risks related to data security and societal disruption.  Ultimately, the realization of a practical quantum computer requires a synergistic interplay between these disciplines, fostering a truly interdisciplinary approach.
