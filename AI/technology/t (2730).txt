Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, though experiencing a recent surge in popularity, possess a history rooted in early computer graphics and simulation research.  Early conceptualizations emerged in the mid-20th century, with Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957) representing a pioneering attempt at immersive sensory experience.  Subsequent advancements in computing power and display technologies fueled the development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) and interactive environments, culminating in the emergence of the first VR systems in the 1980s and 1990s.  AR, building upon similar technological foundations, has progressed from rudimentary overlays to sophisticated applications leveraging advanced image recognition and tracking capabilities.  Current applications span diverse fields, including gaming, healthcare (surgical simulation, rehabilitation), engineering (design visualization, training), and education (interactive learning environments). This paper examines the technological evolution of AR and VR, highlighting key milestones and exploring the current landscape of application development.  Future research directions will focus on improving immersion, reducing costs, addressing issues of user fatigue and cybersickness, and exploring novel applications driven by advancements in artificial intelligence and haptic feedback.
