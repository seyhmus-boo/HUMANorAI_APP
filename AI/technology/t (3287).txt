This presentation explores the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs) through a unique lens: the underlying quantum mechanical principles that underpin their technological advancements. While seemingly disparate, the rise of AVs is deeply intertwined with quantum mechanics.  The immense computational power required for real-time sensor data processing, path planning, and decision-making relies heavily on semiconductor technology, whose functionality is fundamentally governed by quantum phenomena.  We will examine how quantum effects influence the performance of crucial AV components, including LiDAR sensors, whose precision depends on the quantum nature of light, and high-performance computing units reliant on quantum-tunneling effects in transistors.  Furthermore, the development of advanced materials for batteries and lightweight construction, crucial for extended range and efficiency, benefits from quantum chemical simulations for material design.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the future potential of quantum computing in revolutionizing AV algorithms, potentially enabling more robust and efficient navigation, obstacle avoidance, and predictive modelling, ultimately leading to safer and more adaptable autonomous transportation systems.  The presentation will highlight the often-overlooked quantum foundations driving this transformative technology.
