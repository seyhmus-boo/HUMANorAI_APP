Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet interconnected technological advancements with rapidly expanding applications.  Early conceptualizations of immersive environments trace back to Morton Heilig's Sensorama (1957), a pioneering device offering multi-sensory stimulation, foreshadowing VR's development.  The subsequent evolution of computing power and display technologies fueled the emergence of head-mounted displays (HMDs) in the late 20th century, paving the way for rudimentary VR experiences.  However, it was the advent of more affordable and powerful smartphones and mobile computing that significantly broadened the accessibility and adoption of AR, primarily through applications leveraging the device's camera and GPS capabilities for overlaying digital information onto the real world.  Today, applications span diverse sectors.  VR finds utility in training simulations (e.g., flight simulators, surgical training), gaming, and therapeutic interventions for phobias. AR applications are increasingly integrated into retail (virtual try-ons), manufacturing (assembly guidance), and education (interactive learning environments). While challenges remain regarding processing power, content development, and user experience optimization, the convergence of AR and VR technologies promises transformative impacts across various disciplines.
