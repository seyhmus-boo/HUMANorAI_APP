Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), while distinct, are inextricably linked fields driving significant technological advancements. AI, encompassing the broader goal of creating intelligent agents, leverages ML – a subset focusing on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming – to achieve its objectives.  This review highlights the profound impact of AI and ML across diverse sectors.

Practical applications demonstrate the transformative potential of these technologies.  In healthcare, AI-powered diagnostic tools improve accuracy and efficiency, while ML algorithms personalize treatment plans.  Finance utilizes ML for fraud detection and algorithmic trading, enhancing security and profitability.  Autonomous vehicles, a prominent example of AI's impact, rely heavily on ML for object recognition and navigational decision-making.  Furthermore, advancements in natural language processing, a key area of ML, fuel improvements in customer service chatbots and language translation software.  However, ethical considerations surrounding bias in algorithms and data privacy remain crucial challenges requiring ongoing research and robust regulatory frameworks.  Overall, the integration of AI and ML promises to reshape numerous industries, demanding careful consideration of both opportunities and potential risks.
