Artificial intelligence (AI) represents the broader aspiration to create systems capable of exhibiting intelligent behaviour, mirroring human cognitive functions like learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Imagine AI as a grand blueprint for a house, outlining the desired functionality and capabilities.  Machine learning (ML), on the other hand, is a specific tool within this blueprint, akin to a sophisticated construction technique.  ML enables AI systems to learn from data without explicit programming, much like a skilled craftsman refining their technique based on experience with different materials.

Instead of receiving explicit instructions, ML algorithms identify patterns and relationships within data, much like a botanist meticulously studying plant specimens to understand their growth patterns. This learning process allows the system to improve its performance over time, automatically adjusting to new information, analogous to a self-improving irrigation system adapting its water delivery based on soil moisture levels.  Therefore, while all ML is a subset of AI,  not all AI utilizes ML; some AI systems might rely on explicitly programmed rules rather than data-driven learning.  The relationship is thus one of inclusion, where ML provides a powerful methodology for realizing the broader goals of AI.
