Quantum computing holds immense promise, but its transition from theoretical possibility to practical application hinges on overcoming significant experimental challenges.  Scalability remains a paramount hurdle; increasing qubit counts while maintaining high fidelity is exceptionally difficult due to susceptibility to decoherence and crosstalk.  Developing robust error correction protocols is crucial, requiring the creation and manipulation of a large number of qubits dedicated solely to error mitigation, thus further straining scalability.  Maintaining qubit coherence times, currently limited by environmental noise and imperfections in fabrication, demands improved materials science and cryogenic engineering.  Furthermore, the development of efficient and scalable quantum control systems capable of precise manipulation of increasingly complex quantum states poses a significant technological challenge.  Finally, the creation of standardized, reproducible experimental platforms is crucial to ensure results are verifiable and comparable across different research groups, thereby fostering collaborative advancements in this rapidly evolving field.  Addressing these experimental bottlenecks is paramount for realizing the full potential of quantum computing.
