Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies, though experiencing a recent surge in popularity, possess a history rooted in early computer graphics research.  Early conceptualizations, dating back to the mid-20th century, envisioned immersive environments and the overlay of digital information onto the real world.  The development of head-mounted displays (HMDs) in the 1960s marked a significant milestone, enabling rudimentary forms of VR.  However, limitations in processing power and display technology restricted their widespread adoption.  Recent advancements in computing, miniaturization, and sensor technologies have propelled AR and VR into diverse applications.  Current applications span gaming and entertainment, to education and training simulations, and increasingly in healthcare for surgical planning and therapeutic interventions.  This rapid expansion necessitates further research into human-computer interaction, addressing issues such as motion sickness, cognitive load, and the long-term effects of immersive environments.  Future directions include exploring the convergence of AR and VR with other technologies, like artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things, to create more sophisticated and seamless integrated experiences.
