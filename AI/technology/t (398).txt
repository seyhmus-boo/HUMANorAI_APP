This presentation examines the burgeoning field of autonomous vehicles (AVs), tracing its evolution from conceptualization to its current state of rapid technological advancement and societal impact.  Early conceptualizations, dating back to the mid-20th century, focused primarily on theoretical explorations of automated driving systems, hampered by limitations in computing power and sensor technology.  The late 20th and early 21st centuries witnessed significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and sensor technologies, such as LIDAR and radar, paving the way for the development of practical AV prototypes.  This presentation will analyze key milestones in AV development, highlighting the contributions of various researchers and companies.  Further, we will discuss the current challenges facing widespread AV adoption, including ethical considerations surrounding accident liability, the regulatory landscape, and the necessary infrastructure development.  Finally, the presentation will speculate on the potential future impacts of AVs on transportation systems, urban planning, and the broader economy, considering both the opportunities and potential disruptions they may create.
