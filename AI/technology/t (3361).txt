Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly evolving fields demonstrating significant interdisciplinary potential.  This review highlights their multifaceted connections with other disciplines.  Computer science forms the foundational bedrock, providing algorithms and computational power.  However,  substantial contributions arise from mathematics (statistics, probability, linear algebra), crucial for model development and optimization.  Furthermore,  cognitive science and neuroscience offer insights into human intelligence, informing the design of AI systems capable of mimicking or surpassing human cognitive abilities.  Linguistics and natural language processing (NLP) are pivotal for AI's engagement with human language.  Engineering disciplines, particularly robotics and control systems, leverage AI for automation and advanced functionalities.  Finally,  ethical, legal, and societal implications necessitate collaboration with social scientists, philosophers, and legal scholars to address challenges related to bias, accountability, and the societal impact of these powerful technologies.  The successful advancement of AI and ML hinges on fostering strong interdisciplinary collaborations, enabling a holistic approach to both technological development and its societal integration.
