Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) have rapidly transitioned from theoretical concepts to transformative technologies shaping contemporary society.  This research paper explores the intertwined evolution and current applications of AI and ML, highlighting their distinct yet deeply interconnected natures.  The foundational ideas of AI, stemming from the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, initially focused on symbolic reasoning and problem-solving using explicitly programmed rules.  Early successes, such as game-playing programs, fueled optimism about the potential for artificial general intelligence. However, the limitations of these approaches, particularly in handling complex real-world data, became apparent, leading to periods of reduced funding and what is now known as the "AI winter."

The resurgence of AI in recent decades is inextricably linked to advancements in ML, particularly in the subfield of deep learning.  The availability of vast datasets, coupled with increases in computational power and algorithmic innovations, has allowed ML algorithms, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, to achieve unprecedented performance in various domains.  This paper will analyze this symbiotic relationship, examining both the historical context that shaped the field and the current landscape of its applications, challenges, and ethical implications.
