The convergence of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies presents a rapidly evolving landscape with profound implications across diverse sectors.  While traditionally approached from a classical computing perspective, this research explores the potential of quantum mechanics to significantly enhance the capabilities and functionalities of AR/VR applications.  This paper investigates the untapped potential of quantum computing and quantum information science in addressing the limitations of current AR/VR systems, focusing on three key areas:  improved rendering and simulation capabilities leveraging quantum algorithms for faster and more realistic image processing and environment generation; enhanced human-computer interaction through quantum-inspired interfaces that exploit quantum phenomena like superposition and entanglement for intuitive and responsive control; and the development of novel AR/VR experiences enabled by quantum sensing and communication technologies, enabling unprecedented levels of realism and immersion.  We will discuss the theoretical frameworks underpinning these advancements, examine existing research in quantum-enhanced computing and sensing, and propose potential future research directions that could revolutionize the field of immersive technologies.  This exploration marks a crucial step towards realizing the transformative potential of quantum mechanics in shaping the future of AR and VR.
