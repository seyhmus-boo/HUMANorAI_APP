This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications.  While current AR/VR technologies rely primarily on classical computation, the inherent limitations of classical approaches – particularly in handling complex simulations and data processing – suggest a significant potential for quantum enhancements.  We will discuss how quantum computing could revolutionize rendering, physics simulation, and user interaction within AR/VR environments.  Specifically, we will examine the potential for quantum algorithms to accelerate realistic rendering of complex scenes, exceeding the capabilities of classical graphics processing units (GPUs).  Furthermore, we will explore how quantum simulations could enable more accurate and efficient modeling of physical phenomena within VR environments, opening avenues for realistic simulations in fields like molecular modeling and materials science.  Finally, we will address the challenges in developing quantum-enhanced AR/VR, including the need for fault-tolerant quantum computers and the development of novel quantum-classical hybrid algorithms optimized for the specific requirements of these applications.  The presentation will conclude by outlining promising research directions and the potential societal impact of quantum-enhanced AR/VR.
