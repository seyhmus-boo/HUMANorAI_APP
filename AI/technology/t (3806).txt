The Internet of Things (IoT) significantly impacts the development of smart homes, creating interconnected ecosystems of devices enhancing convenience, security, and energy efficiency. This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of this convergence.  Smart homes leverage IoT by enabling communication and data exchange among various household appliances, sensors, and systems, all networked through a central hub or cloud platform.  This interconnectivity facilitates automation through pre-programmed rules or machine learning algorithms, adapting to user preferences and environmental conditions.  The theoretical framework considers the interplay between embedded systems, network protocols (e.g., MQTT, CoAP), and data analytics, highlighting the challenges of data security, privacy, and interoperability in heterogeneous IoT environments.  Furthermore, we analyze the impact of  IoT on user experience, emphasizing aspects such as usability, personalized services, and the potential for cognitive overload resulting from the sheer volume of data and automated functionalities.  Future research should focus on addressing these challenges to realize the full potential of IoT-enabled smart homes.
