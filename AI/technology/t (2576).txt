Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent distinct yet converging technologies with a shared history rooted in early computer-generated imagery and simulation.  While rudimentary forms emerged in the mid-20th century, significant advancements arrived with the development of more powerful computing capabilities and display technologies.  VR, aiming for complete immersion in a simulated environment, utilizes head-mounted displays (HMDs) to create a sense of presence within a virtual world.  Early examples included flight simulators, showcasing the technology's potential for training and simulation.

In contrast, AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing the user's perception of reality.  Early AR applications were primarily limited to research and military contexts.  The proliferation of smartphones and mobile computing, however, has significantly fueled AR's accessibility and popularity, leading to widespread consumer applications such as mobile gaming (e.g., Pok√©mon Go) and interactive advertising.  Both technologies are rapidly evolving, with applications expanding across diverse sectors, including healthcare, education, engineering, and entertainment, promising transformative impacts on various aspects of human experience and interaction.
