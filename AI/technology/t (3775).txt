Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the burgeoning fields of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) and their expanding applications.  While VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, AR overlays digital information onto the real world. Recent advancements significantly impact both fields.

In VR, we've witnessed improvements in haptic feedback systems, offering more realistic tactile sensations, and advancements in high-fidelity visual rendering, reducing motion sickness and enhancing immersion.  Applications now extend beyond gaming, encompassing fields like medical training simulations offering realistic surgical practice and architectural visualization allowing for interactive walkthroughs of building designs.

Meanwhile, AR has seen the proliferation of sophisticated mobile AR applications, driven by enhanced smartphone processing power and improved computer vision algorithms.  Applications now include interactive educational tools, industrial maintenance guides utilizing real-time overlay instructions, and advancements in AR navigation systems, providing more intuitive and immersive spatial guidance.  The convergence of these technologies, particularly with the rise of the metaverse concept, promises even more transformative applications in the near future.
