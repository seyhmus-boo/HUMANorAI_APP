Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly transforming diverse sectors, showcasing substantial application potential beyond entertainment.  This presentation examines the key applications of both paradigms.  AR, overlaying digital information onto the real world, finds significant use in fields like medical training (simulated surgeries, anatomical visualization), engineering (design review and prototyping), and retail (virtual try-on experiences).  The immersive nature of AR enables intuitive interaction and enhanced comprehension compared to traditional methods.  Conversely, VR creates entirely simulated environments, impacting areas such as therapeutic interventions (exposure therapy for phobias), architectural design (virtual walkthroughs), and military training (realistic combat simulations).  The limitations of both technologies, including cost, accessibility, and potential for motion sickness (VR), are acknowledged.  However, ongoing advancements in hardware and software are continually mitigating these constraints, suggesting a future where AR and VR will become increasingly integrated into daily life and professional practices across a wide spectrum of industries.
