The advent of 5G networks represents a significant leap in wireless communication technology, promising unprecedented data speeds and low latency.  While the technological advancements are primarily assessed through classical information theory and engineering perspectives, this paper explores the burgeoning intersection of 5G and quantum mechanics, examining the potential impact of this burgeoning field on both the infrastructure and applications of 5G networks.  Specifically, we investigate the ways in which quantum phenomena might enhance or fundamentally alter aspects of 5G, moving beyond the classical limitations currently inherent in signal processing and data security.  This includes an analysis of the potential for quantum key distribution (QKD) to revolutionize network security, mitigating the vulnerabilities to eavesdropping inherent in classical encryption methods. Furthermore, we consider the application of quantum computing to optimize network management, routing algorithms, and the prediction of network traffic, ultimately improving efficiency and performance.  Finally, we discuss the potential challenges associated with integrating quantum technologies into existing 5G infrastructure, including scalability, cost, and the development of quantum-compatible hardware.  This research aims to provide a foundational understanding of the synergistic potential between these two rapidly advancing fields.
