The Internet of Things (IoT) promises a revolution in domestic life, with smart homes offering enhanced convenience, security, and energy efficiency.  However, realizing the full potential of IoT in this context presents significant experimental challenges. This paper addresses these challenges, focusing on the complexities of designing and conducting rigorous research within the dynamic and multifaceted smart home environment.  Existing literature often overlooks the practical hurdles of data acquisition, particularly concerning the heterogeneous nature of IoT devices and their associated protocols, leading to fragmented and incomparable findings.  Moreover, the inherent variability in user behavior and domestic settings introduces significant noise into experimental data, demanding sophisticated methodologies to isolate the effects of specific IoT interventions.  Furthermore, ethical considerations surrounding data privacy and security within the home environment require careful attention in experimental design. This research explores these challenges, analyzing limitations in current methodologies and proposing potential solutions to enhance the rigor and validity of future studies exploring the impact and usability of IoT in smart homes. We argue that overcoming these hurdles is critical for generating robust evidence to guide the development and deployment of truly beneficial and user-centered smart home technologies.
