Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications, while showing immense potential across diverse fields, face significant experimental challenges hindering their widespread adoption and reliable evaluation.  This abstract highlights key methodological limitations.  Firstly, the inherent subjectivity of user experience presents difficulties in establishing objective measures for evaluating effectiveness.  Standardized metrics for presence, immersion, and usability in AR/VR remain elusive, leading to inconsistent results across studies. Secondly, the diversity of hardware and software platforms necessitates rigorous cross-platform validation, increasing experimental complexity and cost.  Furthermore, ecological validity remains a concern;  experiments often occur in controlled laboratory settings, failing to capture the complexities of real-world application.  The ethical implications of prolonged VR exposure, including potential for simulator sickness and psychological distress, require careful consideration and robust mitigation strategies within experimental design.  Addressing these challenges necessitates the development of standardized protocols, validated metrics, and ecologically valid experimental paradigms to ensure the robust and reliable evaluation of AR/VR applications and their impact.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations to unlock the full potential of these technologies.
