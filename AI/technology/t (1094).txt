Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, finding increasingly diverse applications across various sectors.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception, while VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments.  Practical applications are numerous and impactful.  In healthcare, AR facilitates surgical planning and training through interactive 3D models, while VR provides therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD.  Manufacturing benefits from AR-assisted maintenance and assembly, improving efficiency and reducing errors.  Similarly, AR enhances product design and visualization, enabling interactive prototyping and customer engagement.  In education, VR offers immersive learning experiences, allowing students to explore historical sites or conduct virtual experiments.  Retail utilizes AR for virtual try-ons and product visualization, enhancing the customer journey.  Furthermore, both technologies are crucial in architectural visualization, allowing clients to experience building designs before construction.  Despite limitations like high development costs and potential for motion sickness (in VR), AR and VR are transforming industries, promising continued innovation and widespread adoption.
