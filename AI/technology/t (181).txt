Good morning. Today's lecture concerns cloud computing and its evolutionary trajectory.  The conceptual groundwork was laid in the 1960s with the emergence of time-sharing systems, allowing multiple users to access a central mainframe.  This early form foreshadowed the distributed nature of modern cloud architectures.  The 1990s saw the rise of the internet, providing the crucial infrastructure for networked computing, while the advent of virtualization in the early 2000s revolutionized resource management, enabling the efficient allocation of computing power on demand.  Amazon's launch of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2006 is widely considered a pivotal moment, marking the commercialization and popularization of cloud computing as a service model. This led to the rapid development of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS), fundamentally altering the IT landscape.  The subsequent years have witnessed continuous innovation in areas such as serverless computing and edge computing, demonstrating the ongoing evolution of this transformative technology.  Further research into security and scalability remains crucial for continued growth.
