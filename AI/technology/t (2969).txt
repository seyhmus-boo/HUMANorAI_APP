This presentation traces the evolution of cloud computing, from its nascent stages to its current ubiquitous presence.  We begin by examining the historical roots of the concept, highlighting the influence of earlier distributed computing models and the gradual convergence of technologies like virtualization, the internet, and advanced data storage.  Key milestones such as the emergence of utility computing and the pioneering work of companies like Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be discussed, emphasizing the shift from proprietary, on-premise infrastructure to the shared, scalable resources offered by cloud providers.  The presentation then explores the subsequent evolution of cloud services, encompassing the development of Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS) models.  Finally, we analyze emerging trends, such as serverless computing, edge computing, and the increasing importance of cloud security and data privacy, to offer a perspective on the future trajectory of this transformative technology. The presentation concludes by highlighting the ongoing impact of cloud computing across various sectors and its potential to shape future technological advancements.
