Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly expanding beyond entertainment, demonstrating significant potential across diverse sectors.  Recent developments highlight a shift towards more sophisticated and integrated systems. In healthcare, AR is enabling surgeons with real-time anatomical overlays during procedures, improving precision and minimizing invasiveness.  Simultaneously, VR is being utilized for therapeutic purposes, creating immersive environments for managing phobias or providing rehabilitation exercises in a controlled and engaging setting.  The industrial sector witnesses AR applications streamlining maintenance procedures through overlaid instructions and diagnostic data, enhancing efficiency and reducing downtime.  Similarly, VR is employed for training simulations, allowing employees to practice complex tasks in safe, virtual environments before real-world application.  Further advancements involve improved haptic feedback in VR systems, enhancing user immersion and interaction realism.  The integration of AI is also driving progress, allowing for more personalized and adaptive AR/VR experiences tailored to individual user needs and preferences.  However, challenges remain, including the need for more affordable and accessible hardware, along with addressing concerns regarding potential health impacts and ethical considerations associated with prolonged use.
