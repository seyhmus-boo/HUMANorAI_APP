Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly transforming various sectors, demonstrating significant potential across diverse applications.  This summary examines the current landscape of AR/VR implementations, highlighting their distinct functionalities and overlapping capabilities.  AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through applications such as interactive gaming, heads-up displays in aviation and medicine, and real-time object recognition for industrial maintenance.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely simulated environments, finding utility in training simulations for high-risk professions (e.g., surgery, piloting), therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD, and architectural visualization.  While distinct, these technologies increasingly converge, with examples such as mixed reality (MR) systems integrating aspects of both.  Challenges remain, including hardware limitations, the development of intuitive interfaces, and concerns surrounding user experience, such as motion sickness and visual fatigue.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations and exploring the ethical implications of increasingly immersive and realistic AR/VR technologies to maximize their societal benefit.
