Blockchain technology, initially conceived to underpin the cryptocurrency Bitcoin in 2008, has rapidly evolved beyond its initial application. This presentation provides a concise overview of blockchain's historical trajectory and its diverse contemporary applications.  Beginning with Satoshi Nakamoto's seminal whitepaper, we will trace the development of this decentralized, distributed ledger technology, highlighting its core functionalities: immutability, transparency, and security.  These characteristics enable a wide array of applications beyond cryptocurrencies, including secure supply chain management, enhancing traceability and preventing counterfeiting.  We will examine the potential of blockchain in healthcare, improving data privacy and interoperability within electronic health records.  Further exploration will cover its use in digital identity verification, offering secure and verifiable credentials, and its contribution to voting systems, promoting transparency and preventing electoral fraud. The presentation will conclude with a discussion of the ongoing challenges and future prospects of blockchain technology, considering scalability issues, regulatory frameworks, and the ethical implications of its widespread adoption.
