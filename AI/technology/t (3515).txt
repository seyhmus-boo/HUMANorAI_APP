Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Recent advancements significantly impact both fields.  Deep learning, a type of ML utilizing artificial neural networks with multiple layers, has achieved breakthroughs in image recognition, natural language processing, and game playing, surpassing human performance in certain domains.  The rise of transformer architectures has revolutionized natural language processing, enabling more sophisticated language models like GPT-3 and LaMDA.  Furthermore, reinforcement learning, where agents learn through trial and error, is showing promise in robotics and autonomous systems.  However, challenges remain, including addressing bias in algorithms, ensuring data privacy, and developing explainable AI to enhance transparency and trustworthiness.  The ongoing development and refinement of these techniques promise transformative applications across diverse sectors.
