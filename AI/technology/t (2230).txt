Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly evolving fields, intricately linked yet distinct. AI encompasses the broader goal of creating systems that mimic human intelligence, encompassing tasks like problem-solving and decision-making. ML, a subset of AI, focuses on enabling computer systems to learn from data without explicit programming, leveraging algorithms that identify patterns and make predictions.  This learning process occurs through various techniques, including supervised learning (using labeled data), unsupervised learning (identifying patterns in unlabeled data), and reinforcement learning (learning through trial and error).

The practical applications of AI and ML are vast and transformative. In healthcare, ML algorithms analyze medical images for disease detection, predict patient outcomes, and personalize treatment plans.  Financial institutions utilize these technologies for fraud detection, risk assessment, and algorithmic trading.  Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on ML for object recognition and navigation.  Furthermore, advancements in natural language processing, a key area of AI, power chatbots, language translation tools, and sentiment analysis in social media monitoring.  Despite the transformative potential, ethical considerations regarding bias in algorithms, data privacy, and job displacement remain critical challenges requiring ongoing research and policy development.
