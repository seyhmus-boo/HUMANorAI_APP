This presentation examines the experimental challenges hindering the widespread adoption of autonomous vehicles (AVs). While significant progress has been made in areas such as perception and path planning, several critical hurdles remain.  We will focus on three key experimental challenges:  robustness to edge cases, ethical decision-making, and data limitations.  The unpredictable nature of real-world scenarios necessitates the development of systems capable of handling highly improbable events, a considerable challenge for current algorithms.  Furthermore, the ethical implications of AV decision-making in unavoidable accident scenarios require rigorous experimental investigation and the development of robust and ethically justifiable decision frameworks.  Finally, the dependence of AV training on vast amounts of diverse and accurately labeled data presents significant scalability and bias issues.  We will discuss ongoing research efforts addressing these issues, including advancements in simulation techniques, reinforcement learning, and data augmentation, highlighting the need for robust experimental validation and standardized testing methodologies to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of AV technology.  The presentation concludes by outlining future research directions critical for overcoming these experimental challenges.
