This presentation explores the burgeoning applications of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies across diverse sectors.  We examine the fundamental differences between AR, which overlays digital information onto the real world, and VR, which immerses users in entirely simulated environments.  The discussion will analyze the unique capabilities of each technology and highlight their respective strengths and limitations in specific application areas.  Examples will include the use of AR in medical training (e.g., surgical simulations) and industrial maintenance (e.g., remote expert assistance), contrasted with VR's application in architectural visualization, immersive gaming, and therapeutic interventions for anxiety disorders.  Furthermore, we will address the emerging challenges associated with widespread adoption, including technological limitations (e.g., processing power, latency), user experience design considerations (e.g., motion sickness, cognitive load), and ethical implications related to data privacy and potential misuse.  The presentation concludes by offering a perspective on future trends and potential breakthroughs in AR/VR technology and their societal impact.
