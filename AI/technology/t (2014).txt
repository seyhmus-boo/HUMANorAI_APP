Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are rapidly evolving fields with significant implications across diverse sectors.  This lecture provides a foundational overview, differentiating AI as the broader concept encompassing systems designed to mimic human cognitive functions, and ML as a subset focusing on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  We explore key ML paradigms, including supervised learning (e.g., classification, regression), unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, dimensionality reduction), and reinforcement learning (e.g., Markov Decision Processes).  The lecture emphasizes the crucial role of data in training ML models, highlighting issues of data quality, bias, and the ethical considerations inherent in deploying AI/ML systems in real-world applications.  Finally, we briefly touch upon current limitations and future research directions, including explainability, robustness, and the development of more generalizable AI.  A comprehensive understanding of these fundamental concepts is essential for navigating the transformative impact of AI/ML on society.
