The future of quantum computing hinges critically on overcoming significant experimental challenges.  Maintaining quantum coherence, the delicate superposition of quantum states crucial for computation, remains a primary obstacle.  Environmental noise, including thermal fluctuations and electromagnetic interference, rapidly decoheres qubits, limiting computation time and scale.  Developing robust qubit architectures with extended coherence times, perhaps through advanced materials or topological protection, is paramount.

Furthermore, scaling up the number of qubits while maintaining individual control and entanglement presents a formidable engineering hurdle.  Current approaches, such as trapped ions or superconducting circuits, face limitations in scalability and require increasingly complex control systems.  Developing fault-tolerant quantum error correction codes, capable of mitigating decoherence and gate errors, is essential for building large-scale, practical quantum computers.  Finally, the development of efficient and scalable quantum algorithms for addressing relevant problems remains an active area of research, impacting the ultimate utility of any realized quantum hardware.  Overcoming these intertwined experimental hurdles is crucial for transitioning from proof-of-concept demonstrations to impactful, large-scale quantum computing.
