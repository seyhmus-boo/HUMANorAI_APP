Artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the development of computer systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Machine learning (ML), a subset of AI, focuses on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  ML algorithms identify patterns and build models from input data, improving their performance over time.  This learning process can be supervised, using labelled data to guide the model, unsupervised, discovering patterns in unlabeled data, or reinforcement-based, where the model learns through trial and error based on reward signals.

The synergy between AI and ML fuels numerous practical applications.  In healthcare, ML algorithms analyze medical images for disease detection, while AI-powered systems assist in diagnosis and treatment planning.  Financial institutions employ AI for fraud detection and algorithmic trading, leveraging ML to predict market trends.  Self-driving cars rely heavily on AI and ML for object recognition and navigation.  Furthermore,  personalized recommendations in e-commerce and natural language processing in virtual assistants represent further instances of their widespread integration across diverse sectors. The continuous advancements in both fields promise even more transformative applications in the future.
