Good morning. Today's lecture will explore the burgeoning fields of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR).  While seemingly futuristic, their conceptual roots trace back decades.  Early VR prototypes emerged in the mid-20th century, focusing on immersive simulated environments, initially driven by military and flight simulation needs.  Similarly, the foundational concepts of AR, overlaying digital information onto the real world, have existed for considerably longer, albeit with limited technological capability.

The modern iteration of these technologies is facilitated by advancements in computing power, display technologies, and sensor integration.  AR applications, such as heads-up displays and interactive gaming, augment our perception of reality, enriching it with digital elements. Conversely, VR systems create entirely synthetic environments, offering immersive experiences for entertainment, training, and therapeutic applications.  Both fields are rapidly evolving, with significant implications for diverse sectors, from healthcare and education to manufacturing and entertainment, driving considerable ongoing research and development.  Further exploration will delve into specific examples and emerging challenges in these dynamic fields.
