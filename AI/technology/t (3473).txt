Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the applications of augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).  Imagine AR as a transparent overlay on the real world.  Think of Google Glass, superimposing digital information, like directions, directly onto your field of vision â€“ it *augments* your perception.  Conversely, VR is akin to stepping into a completely simulated environment.  Consider a flight simulator: it creates a wholly immersive experience, distinct from reality, providing a fully fabricated sensory input.

The applications of these technologies are vast and rapidly expanding.  In medicine, AR allows surgeons to visualize internal organs during procedures, while VR assists in phobia treatment through exposure therapy. In engineering, VR enables architects to walk through virtual building designs before construction, while AR can overlay schematics onto physical machinery for maintenance.  The entertainment industry uses both extensively, offering immersive gaming experiences in VR and interactive digital content in AR.  Essentially, AR and VR are reshaping how we interact with both the real and the digital, offering unprecedented opportunities across diverse fields.
