The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart homes presents significant experimental challenges for researchers.  This abstract focuses on key methodological hurdles in evaluating the performance and security of these complex, interconnected systems.  Reproducibility is a major concern, hampered by vendor lock-in, proprietary protocols, and the heterogeneity of devices and platforms.  Controlled experimental environments are difficult to establish, as real-world smart home scenarios are inherently dynamic and influenced by unpredictable user behaviour and network conditions.  Furthermore, the sheer scale of data generated by numerous IoT devices poses significant challenges for data acquisition, storage, and analysis.  Security testing faces limitations due to the complexity of potential attack vectors, requiring both black-box and white-box approaches with varying levels of access and control.  Ethical considerations, such as privacy and data protection, further complicate experimentation, necessitating rigorous anonymization and informed consent protocols.  Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for advancing the understanding and development of robust, secure, and user-friendly smart home technologies. Future research should prioritize standardized testing methodologies and open-source platforms to facilitate reproducibility and comparative analysis.
