This presentation explores the nascent intersection of quantum mechanics and artificial intelligence (AI), specifically focusing on the potential of quantum computing to revolutionize machine learning (ML) algorithms.  Classical ML algorithms face limitations in tackling complex problems due to the exponential scaling of computational resources required.  Quantum computing, leveraging phenomena such as superposition and entanglement, offers a pathway to overcome these limitations.  We will examine several promising avenues, including quantum annealing for optimization problems central to ML, the development of quantum neural networks with enhanced learning capabilities, and the application of quantum algorithms to improve upon classical data preprocessing and feature extraction techniques.  Particular attention will be given to the challenges inherent in developing quantum ML, such as qubit coherence times and the complexities of quantum algorithm design and error correction.  The presentation will conclude by discussing potential applications of quantum-enhanced ML in fields such as drug discovery, materials science, and financial modeling, highlighting the transformative potential of this emerging field while acknowledging the current technological hurdles that must be overcome for widespread implementation.
