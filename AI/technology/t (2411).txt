Cybersecurity, in the digital age, mirrors the challenges of safeguarding a physical fortress.  This presentation explores the evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats and the analogous defensive strategies required.  Just as a medieval castle needed moats (firewalls) and sturdy walls (intrusion detection systems), modern organizations rely on multi-layered security architectures to repel attacks.  However, the modern digital "siege" differs significantly.  Instead of catapults, we face sophisticated phishing campaigns (social engineering) and malware (trojan horses) designed to exploit vulnerabilities in our "walls."  Furthermore, the speed and scale of attacks, analogous to a coordinated army assault, necessitate proactive defenses.  We will examine the use of artificial intelligence (AI) as the "sentinel," constantly monitoring for breaches and adapting to new threats, much like a vigilant guard.  The presentation concludes by discussing the importance of human factors – the "garrison" – in maintaining cybersecurity, highlighting the critical role of employee training and security awareness in bolstering overall defenses against these relentless attacks.  Ultimately, successful cybersecurity relies on a robust and adaptable strategy combining technological solutions with informed human action.
