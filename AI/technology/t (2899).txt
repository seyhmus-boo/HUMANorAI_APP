This presentation explores the transformative role of big data in contemporary industries, emphasizing its inherently interdisciplinary nature.  The exponential growth of data necessitates collaboration across traditional disciplinary boundaries to effectively harness its potential. We will examine how fields like computer science, statistics, and data mining provide the foundational tools for data acquisition, storage, and analysis.  However, realizing the full value of big data demands integration with domain-specific expertise.  Examples will illustrate how industry sectors such as healthcare (predictive diagnostics), finance (fraud detection), and manufacturing (predictive maintenance) leverage big data analytics alongside medical expertise, financial modeling, and engineering knowledge respectively.  We will discuss the challenges associated with interdisciplinary collaboration, including differing terminologies, methodologies, and data interpretation frameworks.  Furthermore, we will address ethical considerations surrounding data privacy, bias, and algorithmic accountability, highlighting the necessity of incorporating ethical frameworks within the interdisciplinary approach.  Finally, the presentation will conclude by outlining future research directions emphasizing the crucial need for ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration to fully exploit the potential of big data for societal benefit.
