Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are closely related yet distinct fields within computer science.  AI, broadly defined, encompasses the development of systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, and decision-making.  Its historical roots trace back to the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, marking the formal inception of the field.  Early AI focused on symbolic reasoning and rule-based systems, encountering limitations in handling complex, real-world data.

Machine learning, a subfield of AI, emerged as a more data-driven approach.  Instead of explicitly programming rules, ML algorithms learn patterns and make predictions from data. This paradigm shift, fueled by increasing computational power and data availability, led to significant advancements.  Early ML techniques, like decision trees and naive Bayes, paved the way for more sophisticated algorithms such as support vector machines and neural networks.  Deep learning, a subset of ML employing deep neural networks with multiple layers, has recently propelled AI capabilities forward, achieving remarkable success in areas like image recognition and natural language processing.  The interplay between AI's overarching goals and ML's data-driven methodology continues to shape the landscape of modern technological innovation.
