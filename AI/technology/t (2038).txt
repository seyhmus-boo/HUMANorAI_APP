This presentation explores the evolution of cloud computing, tracing its trajectory from nascent grid computing concepts to its current ubiquitous presence.  We begin by briefly outlining the foundational pillars of cloud computing – namely, virtualization, distributed systems, and the internet – highlighting their convergence in enabling scalable and on-demand resource provision.  The presentation then examines key evolutionary stages, from the early adoption of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) to the proliferation of Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models.  

Recent developments are a central focus, with particular attention paid to the rise of serverless computing, its implications for application development, and its challenges in terms of cost optimization and operational management.  Furthermore, the growing importance of edge computing, driven by the Internet of Things (IoT) and the need for low-latency applications, will be discussed.  Finally, we analyze current trends including the increasing adoption of AI/ML within cloud infrastructure, the expanding focus on sustainability and green computing practices in cloud deployments, and the ongoing debates around data sovereignty and security in a globally interconnected cloud environment.  The presentation concludes by speculating on potential future directions for cloud computing.
