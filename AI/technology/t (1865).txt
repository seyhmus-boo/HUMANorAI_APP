Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies are rapidly evolving, transforming various sectors and permeating everyday life.  This research paper explores the diverse applications of AR and VR, moving beyond the entertainment industry to examine their practical implications across multiple domains.  While both technologies offer immersive experiences, their approaches differ significantly: AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing users' perception of their environment, while VR creates entirely simulated environments, immersing users in a completely artificial space.  

The practical applications of these technologies are extensive.  In healthcare, AR is used for surgical planning and training, while VR aids in treating phobias and managing chronic pain.  In education, immersive simulations provide engaging learning experiences, enhancing comprehension and retention.  Manufacturing benefits from AR-assisted maintenance and assembly processes, increasing efficiency and reducing errors.  Furthermore, AR and VR are transforming retail through virtual try-on experiences and interactive product demonstrations, enhancing the customer experience. This paper will delve into the specific methodologies and impact of AR and VR applications within these fields, analyzing their advantages, limitations, and future potential.
