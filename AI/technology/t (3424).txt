This presentation offers a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), utilizing accessible analogies to demystify these rapidly evolving fields.  AI, in its broadest sense, can be likened to a human expert system:  it aims to mimic human cognitive functions like learning, problem-solving, and decision-making.  However, unlike a human expert who relies on explicitly programmed knowledge, AI systems often leverage ML techniques.

ML, in contrast, resembles a child learning from experience. Instead of being explicitly programmed with rules, ML algorithms learn patterns and relationships from data.  Imagine teaching a child to identify cats: you show them numerous examples, and they gradually learn to distinguish cats from other animals.  Similarly, ML algorithms learn by analyzing vast datasets, identifying underlying structures, and making predictions based on these learned patterns.  We will explore two key ML paradigms: supervised learning (like a teacher grading a student's work) and unsupervised learning (like a child discovering patterns in a toy box without explicit instruction).  Finally, we will briefly discuss the ethical implications and societal impact of these powerful technologies, highlighting the importance of responsible development and deployment.
