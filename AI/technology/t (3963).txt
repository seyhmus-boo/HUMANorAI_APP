Artificial intelligence (AI) and its subfield, machine learning (ML), have witnessed unprecedented growth, permeating diverse sectors from healthcare to finance.  While theoretical advancements continue to propel the field forward, significant experimental challenges hinder the realization of its full potential. This paper addresses these crucial obstacles, focusing on three key areas. Firstly, the inherent limitations of current datasets, including bias, scarcity, and the difficulty in obtaining representative samples, significantly impact model accuracy and generalizability.  Secondly, the computational cost associated with training complex AI/ML models, particularly deep learning architectures, remains a substantial hurdle, demanding substantial resources and energy. This necessitates exploration of more efficient training methods and hardware solutions.  Finally, the lack of standardized evaluation metrics and robust benchmarking frameworks complicates the comparative analysis of different algorithms and their performance across various domains.  This paper will critically examine these experimental challenges, analyzing their impact on the development and deployment of AI/ML systems and proposing potential avenues for future research to mitigate these limitations and pave the way for more robust and reliable AI applications.
