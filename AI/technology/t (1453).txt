The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has profoundly impacted residential environments, giving rise to the concept of the smart home. This paper investigates the multifaceted relationship between IoT and smart home technologies, examining their current functionalities, limitations, and future potential.  We analyze the diverse range of IoT devices integrated within smart homes, encompassing smart appliances, security systems, energy management solutions, and entertainment platforms.  A key focus is the convergence of these devices through interconnected networks and platforms, facilitated by advancements in communication protocols and data analytics. The study explores the associated benefits, including enhanced convenience, energy efficiency, and security, alongside critical challenges such as data privacy concerns, cybersecurity vulnerabilities, and interoperability issues.  Furthermore, we discuss the evolving socio-economic implications of smart home adoption, considering factors like affordability, digital literacy, and the potential for social exclusion.  This research contributes to a comprehensive understanding of the ongoing evolution of smart home ecosystems and identifies key areas requiring further investigation to ensure responsible and equitable technological advancement.
