The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) represents a significant technological leap, poised to revolutionize transportation and logistics. While the prevailing discourse focuses on engineering, algorithmic, and societal implications, this paper explores the nascent but potentially transformative role of quantum mechanics in the advancement of AV technology.  Current AV development relies heavily on classical computational approaches for tasks such as sensor fusion, path planning, and object recognition.  However, these approaches face limitations in processing the vast amounts of data generated by sophisticated sensor arrays and navigating complex, unpredictable environments. This research argues that quantum computing and quantum sensing technologies offer a pathway to overcome these limitations. Specifically, we investigate the potential applications of quantum algorithms for enhanced data processing speed and accuracy in areas such as real-time obstacle detection and predictive modelling of traffic flow. Furthermore, we examine the possibilities offered by quantum sensors for improved precision in localization and environmental mapping, potentially leading to safer and more efficient navigation.  This interdisciplinary study bridges the gap between the burgeoning field of quantum technologies and the rapidly evolving landscape of autonomous driving, highlighting the potential for synergistic advancements in both domains.
