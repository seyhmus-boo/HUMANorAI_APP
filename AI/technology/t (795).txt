Cloud computing, the on-demand availability of computer system resources, has undergone a rapid evolution, significantly impacting diverse fields.  Initially characterized by Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), offering basic computing resources, its progression has been driven by interdisciplinary collaborations.  Computer science provided the foundational architecture, while networking advancements, a key element of telecommunications engineering, enabled scalability and accessibility.  The rise of Software as a Service (SaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS) leveraged software engineering principles and database management expertise from information systems.

Furthermore, the expansion into areas like big data analytics relies heavily on mathematical statistics and data science.  The security concerns inherent in cloud computing necessitate contributions from cryptography and cybersecurity experts, ensuring data integrity and confidentiality.  Economic models, developed in conjunction with business administration, shape pricing strategies and service offerings.  Thus, the evolution of cloud computing reflects a synergistic interplay across multiple disciplines, shaping both its technical capabilities and economic viability.
