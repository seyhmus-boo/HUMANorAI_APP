The rapid proliferation of autonomous vehicles (AVs) marks a significant technological leap, impacting transportation, infrastructure, and societal structures globally. While the dominant discourse surrounding AVs focuses on engineering, algorithmic development, and ethical considerations, this paper explores the nascent but crucial intersection of AV technology with quantum mechanics.  Existing research largely neglects the potential applications of quantum phenomena, despite their capacity to revolutionize several critical AV components. We posit that the limitations of classical computing in handling the vast datasets and complex real-time computations required for safe and efficient autonomous navigation could be overcome by leveraging quantum technologies. This paper examines the potential of quantum computing for tasks such as sensor fusion, path planning, and obstacle avoidance, particularly addressing the challenges posed by uncertainty and the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.  Further, we explore the feasibility of quantum sensing for enhanced environmental perception, potentially surpassing the limitations of current LiDAR and radar systems.  Finally, we discuss the broader implications of quantum-enhanced AVs, including enhanced security and the development of more robust and resilient autonomous systems. This investigation aims to lay the groundwork for future research into a quantum-enhanced paradigm for autonomous vehicle technology.
