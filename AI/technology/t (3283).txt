This presentation explores the evolution of cloud computing and its increasingly significant interdisciplinary connections.  Initially conceived as a simple utility computing model, cloud computing has rapidly expanded its influence, impacting diverse fields from computer science and engineering to economics, sociology, and environmental studies.  We will trace its progression from early grid computing initiatives to the current proliferation of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) models.  The presentation will analyze the interwoven technological advancements, such as virtualization, containerization, and serverless architectures, that have fueled this expansion.  Furthermore, we will examine the crucial interdisciplinary aspects: the economic implications of cloud adoption on businesses and national economies; the societal impacts on data privacy, security, and digital inequality; and the environmental considerations regarding energy consumption and carbon footprint.  Finally, we will briefly discuss emerging trends and future directions, highlighting the continued need for interdisciplinary collaboration to address the multifaceted challenges and opportunities presented by this transformative technology.
