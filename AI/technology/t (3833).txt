Cloud computing, a paradigm shift in information technology, has evolved rapidly from its nascent stages in the late 20th century, demonstrating strong interdisciplinary links.  Initially driven by advancements in distributed systems and networking (computer science), its development benefited significantly from breakthroughs in data storage technologies (materials science and electrical engineering).  The increasing sophistication of virtualization technologies, enabling the efficient allocation of resources, further propelled its growth.  Meanwhile, the burgeoning field of cryptography (mathematics and computer science) provided the essential security mechanisms for safeguarding data stored in remote environments.  Furthermore, the economic viability of cloud computing hinges on effective resource management and cost optimization, drawing heavily on principles from operations research and business management. The rise of big data analytics, requiring powerful computational capabilities and sophisticated statistical modelling (statistics and data science), has fuelled the demand for cloud-based solutions. Consequently, the continued evolution of cloud computing is inextricably linked to advancements across diverse fields, highlighting its interdisciplinary nature and its profound impact on various sectors of society.
