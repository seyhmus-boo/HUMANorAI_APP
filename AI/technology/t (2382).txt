This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), highlighting their growing impact across diverse sectors.  We will delineate the fundamental differences between AI and ML, emphasizing ML's role as a subset of AI focused on enabling systems to learn from data without explicit programming.  Key learning algorithms, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, will be briefly introduced, showcasing their distinct methodologies and applications.

The presentation will then explore a range of practical applications demonstrating the transformative potential of AI/ML.  Examples will include advancements in medical diagnosis leveraging image recognition and predictive analytics, personalized recommendations in e-commerce fueled by collaborative filtering, and the optimization of logistics and supply chains through predictive maintenance and route planning.  Further, we will touch upon the ethical considerations surrounding AI/ML deployment, acknowledging the importance of responsible development and deployment to mitigate potential biases and societal risks.  Finally, we will briefly discuss future trends and research directions in this rapidly evolving field.
