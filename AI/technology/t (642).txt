This presentation examines the evolution of cloud computing, tracing its historical trajectory from early distributed computing concepts to its current ubiquitous presence.  We begin by exploring the foundational elements, including the development of time-sharing systems and the emergence of the client-server model in the 1960s and 70s, which laid the groundwork for virtualization and resource pooling.  The presentation will then discuss the pivotal role of the internet in facilitating the scalability and accessibility necessary for cloud computing's maturation.  Key milestones, such as the introduction of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and the rise of virtualization technologies like VMware, will be highlighted, underscoring their contribution to the transition towards cloud-based services.  We will then analyze the different service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and deployment models (public, private, hybrid) that have shaped the modern cloud landscape.  Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss emerging trends, such as serverless computing and edge computing, and speculate on the future directions of this transformative technology.  The overall aim is to provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of cloud computing's development and its continuing impact on various sectors.
