This presentation examines the multifaceted cybersecurity challenges facing contemporary society, emphasizing the crucial need for interdisciplinary collaboration to develop effective solutions.  Traditional approaches, focusing solely on technical safeguards, are demonstrably insufficient in addressing the increasingly sophisticated and multifaceted nature of cyber threats.  We argue that a holistic understanding necessitates integrating expertise from diverse fields. This includes not only computer science and engineering, but also the social sciences (e.g., sociology, psychology, criminology) to understand attacker motivations and user behavior, law and policy to establish effective regulatory frameworks, and economics to analyze the cost-benefit implications of various security measures.  The presentation will explore specific examples, such as the interdisciplinary approaches required to combat misinformation campaigns,  analyze the societal impact of large-scale data breaches, and develop robust cybersecurity education and training programs.  Ultimately, we will advocate for fostering greater collaboration between disciplines to address the complex and evolving landscape of cybersecurity threats, moving beyond a purely technological focus to a more comprehensive and effective strategy.
