Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the burgeoning fields of Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) and their diverse applications.  Recent developments showcase a significant shift beyond gaming and entertainment.  In AR, we observe advancements in spatial computing, enabling more seamless integration of digital overlays onto the real world. This is exemplified by improved object recognition and tracking algorithms, facilitating sophisticated applications in fields like architecture, allowing for real-time visualization of building designs superimposed on existing structures.

VR, meanwhile, is witnessing progress in haptic feedback technology, providing users with a more tangible sense of presence within virtual environments. This enhancement significantly benefits medical training, allowing surgeons to practice complex procedures in simulated settings with realistic tactile responses. Furthermore, advancements in high-fidelity rendering and immersive audio contribute to a heightened sense of realism, broadening applications in areas such as therapeutic interventions for phobias and PTSD.  The convergence of these technologies promises even more sophisticated and impactful applications in the future.
