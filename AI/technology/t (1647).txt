The advent of quantum computing presents both profound challenges and potential solutions to existing cybersecurity paradigms.  Currently prevalent cryptographic algorithms, relying on the computational intractability of problems like integer factorization (RSA) and discrete logarithm, are vulnerable to attacks from sufficiently powerful quantum computers.  Shor's algorithm, for instance, demonstrates the feasibility of breaking these algorithms, jeopardizing data confidentiality and integrity on a massive scale.  This necessitates the development of quantum-resistant cryptography (QRC), focusing on algorithms whose security relies on problems believed to be intractable even for quantum computers.  Lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, and multivariate cryptography are leading candidates in this domain.

However, the transition to QRC is not without its challenges.  Implementation complexities, performance limitations, and the need for robust key management protocols pose significant hurdles.  Furthermore, the very technology underpinning QRC might also be exploited by adversaries.  Quantum key distribution (QKD), leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics to secure key exchange, offers a promising solution for unconditionally secure communication, although practical deployment faces limitations in distance and infrastructure.  Ultimately, a holistic approach encompassing algorithm development, protocol standardization, and robust quantum-resistant infrastructure is required to effectively mitigate the impending quantum threat to cybersecurity.
