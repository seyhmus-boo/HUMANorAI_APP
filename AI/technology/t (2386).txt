This presentation explores the burgeoning field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), emphasizing its increasingly significant interdisciplinary connections.  While traditionally rooted in computer science and mathematics, AI/ML's impact now transcends disciplinary boundaries, offering transformative potential across diverse sectors.  We will examine key interdisciplinary links, including the application of ML algorithms in analyzing complex biological datasets (bioinformatics), the use of AI in optimizing social systems (socio-technical systems), and the development of AI-driven tools for humanistic research in the arts and humanities (digital humanities).  Further, we will discuss the ethical and societal implications arising from these collaborations, highlighting the necessity of interdisciplinary dialogue to address challenges such as bias in algorithms and responsible AI development.  The presentation will conclude by considering future research directions that necessitate collaborative efforts between traditionally distinct disciplines to fully unlock the potential and mitigate the risks of AI/ML technologies.  This interdisciplinary approach is crucial for navigating the complex landscape of AI/ML and ensuring its beneficial integration into society.
