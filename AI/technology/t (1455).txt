The rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs) can be understood as a confluence of technological advancements analogous to the development of flight.  Initially, the Wright brothers' rudimentary aircraft represented a basic, unreliable proof-of-concept, much like early AV prototypes with limited capabilities and frequent malfunctions.  Subsequent progress, mirroring the evolution from biplanes to jets, involved incremental improvements in sensor technology (the "wings" and "engine" of AVs), encompassing lidar, radar, and computer vision.  These advancements, coupled with exponential growth in computing power (the "fuel" of the system), enabled increasingly sophisticated navigation and decision-making algorithms â€“ the "flight control" system.

Furthermore, the societal adoption of AVs parallels the adoption of air travel.  Initially, only the wealthy and adventurous embraced the risks associated with early aviation.  Similarly, early AV adoption will likely be limited by cost, public trust, and regulatory hurdles.  However, as technology matures and safety standards are established, wider public acceptance will follow, much like the democratization of air travel.  This transition, however, will necessitate substantial infrastructural changes, analogous to the development of airports and air traffic control systems, requiring coordinated efforts between governments, industries, and researchers.
