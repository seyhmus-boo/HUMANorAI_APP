Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) represent transformative technologies with burgeoning applications across diverse sectors.  This lecture explores the core functionalities and distinct applications of each. AR overlays digital information onto the real world, enhancing user perception through devices like smartphones and smart glasses.  Examples include interactive gaming, heads-up displays in aviation, and medical training simulations offering realistic anatomical overlays.  Conversely, VR immerses users in entirely computer-generated environments, isolating them from physical reality through headsets and haptic feedback devices.  Applications range from immersive gaming and virtual tourism to therapeutic interventions for phobias and rehabilitation exercises. While both technologies share the goal of enhancing user experience, AR focuses on augmenting reality, whereas VR creates completely synthetic realities. The lecture concludes by examining the converging trends and future potential of AR and VR, highlighting the ongoing development of hybrid systems integrating both modalities for even richer and more impactful user experiences.
