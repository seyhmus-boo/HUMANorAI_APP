This abstract explores the potential intersection of quantum mechanics and augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR) applications.  While current AR/VR technologies primarily leverage classical computational methods, the inherent limitations of these approaches, such as processing power and data storage requirements for complex simulations, suggest a future role for quantum computing.  Quantum algorithms, particularly those exhibiting quantum speedup like Grover's search and Shor's algorithm, could dramatically improve rendering speeds and enhance the realism of simulated environments in VR.  Moreover, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) offer the possibility of generating more unpredictable and statistically superior random numbers for applications like procedural content generation, significantly impacting the immersion and replayability of AR/VR experiences.  Challenges remain, including the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers and the integration of quantum hardware with existing AR/VR platforms.  However, exploration of quantum-enhanced AR/VR is crucial for pushing the boundaries of these technologies, potentially unlocking new functionalities in areas such as realistic physics simulation, advanced user interface design, and the creation of truly immersive and interactive experiences.  Future research should focus on identifying specific quantum algorithms and hardware architectures most suitable for AR/VR applications.
