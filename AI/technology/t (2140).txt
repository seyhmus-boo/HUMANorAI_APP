Augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications are rapidly expanding beyond entertainment, demonstrating significant potential across diverse scientific and industrial domains.  Their interdisciplinary nature necessitates collaborations between computer science, engineering, psychology, and human-computer interaction (HCI).  Advances in computer vision, 3D modeling, and haptic feedback are crucial for developing immersive and intuitive AR/VR experiences.  Psychology plays a vital role in understanding user experience, cognitive load, and the potential for cybersickness.  HCI research informs the design of effective interfaces and interaction paradigms, maximizing usability and accessibility.  Applications span diverse fields: medicine utilizes AR for surgical planning and training, while VR aids in phobia treatment and rehabilitation; engineering employs AR for design visualization and maintenance; and education leverages both technologies for engaging and interactive learning environments.  Future research should focus on addressing challenges such as computational limitations, high-fidelity rendering, and the ethical implications of increasingly immersive digital environments, requiring sustained interdisciplinary collaboration to fully realize the transformative potential of AR and VR.
