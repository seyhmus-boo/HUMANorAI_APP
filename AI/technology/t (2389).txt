This presentation traces the evolution of cloud computing, from its nascent stages as utility computing to its current pervasive influence across diverse sectors.  We will explore the key architectural shifts, highlighting the transition from monolithic infrastructure to microservices and serverless architectures, driven by advancements in virtualization, containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), and automation technologies.  This evolution has been accompanied by a broadening spectrum of service models, encompassing Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), each catering to different levels of user control and management needs.  

Practical applications demonstrating the impact of cloud computing will be showcased, including the scalability afforded to e-commerce platforms during peak shopping seasons, the cost-effectiveness achieved by enterprises migrating legacy systems to the cloud, and the enhanced analytical capabilities enabled by cloud-based big data processing.  Finally, we will briefly address the ongoing challenges, such as security concerns, data sovereignty issues, and the inherent complexities of cloud management, while considering future trends like edge computing and quantum cloud computing.
