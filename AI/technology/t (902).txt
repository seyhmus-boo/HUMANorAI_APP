This presentation provides a concise overview of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), focusing on their rapidly expanding practical applications across diverse sectors.  We begin by defining core AI concepts, differentiating between narrow and general AI, and outlining the key methodologies underpinning ML, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning.  The presentation will then explore a range of impactful applications, examining real-world examples.  This includes the use of ML in medical diagnosis, facilitating earlier and more accurate detection of diseases through image analysis and predictive modelling; its application in finance, powering algorithmic trading and fraud detection systems; and its role in personalized marketing and recommendation systems in the e-commerce industry.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the ethical considerations and potential societal impacts associated with the widespread adoption of AI and ML technologies, emphasizing the need for responsible development and deployment. The presentation aims to equip attendees with a foundational understanding of these transformative technologies and their pervasive influence on contemporary society.
