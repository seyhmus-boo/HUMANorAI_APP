Quantum entanglement describes a peculiar correlation between two or more quantum particles, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  Imagine two coins, inextricably linked such that if one lands heads, the other *must* land tails, instantaneously, even if separated by vast distances. This isn't simply a matter of pre-determined states; the individual coin's outcome remains undefined until measured.  The act of measuring one coin instantly collapses the wave function of both, determining the state of the entangled pair.

Unlike classical correlations, which can be explained by shared history, entanglement exhibits stronger-than-classical correlations.  Consider two gloves, one left and one right, placed in separate boxes.  Knowing one box contains a left glove instantly tells you the other contains a right glove.  This is classical correlation.  Entanglement, however, transcends this analogy:  before measurement, the "gloves" exist in a superposition – a probabilistic blend of both left and right – only collapsing into a defined state upon observation. This non-local correlation defies classical intuition and highlights the fundamentally probabilistic and interconnected nature of the quantum realm. The instantaneous correlation, however, does not allow faster-than-light communication.
