Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, comprises two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  Imagine a factory: the light-dependent reactions are the power generation plant.  Sunlight, analogous to fuel, drives the splitting of water molecules (photolysis), releasing electrons. These electrons travel down an electron transport chain, a series of molecular "turbines," generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the factory's energy currency, and NADPH, a reducing agent akin to a chemical delivery truck.

The light-independent reactions are the assembly line.  Here, carbon dioxide, the raw material, enters the Calvin cycle.  Using the ATP and NADPH generated in the "power plant," the cycle fixes carbon dioxide into glucose, a stable, energy-rich sugar molecule analogous to the factory's finished product.  This glucose is then used for plant growth and metabolic processes, representing the factory's output.  The entire process is meticulously orchestrated by enzymes acting as skilled workers within the "factory," ensuring efficient energy conversion and carbohydrate production.
