Chemical bonding and molecular structure are intrinsically linked, dictating a molecule's physical and chemical properties.  This lecture explores the fundamental principles governing the formation of chemical bonds, focusing on ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding.  Ionic bonds arise from electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, formed through electron transfer, typically between metals and non-metals. Covalent bonds, conversely, involve the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, prevalent among non-metals, resulting in discrete molecules with specific geometries.  Metallic bonding, characterized by delocalized electrons within a lattice of metal cations, accounts for the unique properties of metals, such as conductivity and malleability.  Molecular structure, determined by VSEPR theory and other advanced techniques, is directly influenced by the type and number of bonds, influencing polarity, reactivity, and intermolecular forces. Understanding these relationships is crucial for predicting and explaining the behaviour of chemical substances across diverse applications, from materials science to biochemistry.  Further exploration of advanced bonding theories, such as molecular orbital theory, offers a more sophisticated understanding of this crucial area of chemistry.
