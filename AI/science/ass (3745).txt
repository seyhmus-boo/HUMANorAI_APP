Good morning. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, the fundamental process by which a cell duplicates its genome prior to cell division.  This semi-conservative mechanism ensures each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the parental DNA.  Initiation involves unwinding the double helix at specific origins of replication, creating replication forks.  Leading and lagging strands are then synthesised by DNA polymerase, utilising a primer and adding nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction.  The lagging strand's discontinuous synthesis results in Okazaki fragments, later joined by ligase.  Proofreading mechanisms minimise errors, though mutations can still occur.

The fidelity of DNA replication is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity, and its understanding has far-reaching practical applications.  These include polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, essential for DNA amplification in forensic science and medical diagnostics.  Furthermore, knowledge of replication mechanisms informs our understanding of diseases arising from replication errors, such as cancer, and is critical in the development of targeted therapies.  Finally, the manipulation of replication processes is fundamental to genetic engineering and biotechnology.
