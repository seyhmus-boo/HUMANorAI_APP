Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a cornerstone of nuclear energy generation and a subject of ongoing scientific investigation.  This review summarizes the key processes involved, highlighting the critical role of neutron interactions in initiating and sustaining chain reactions.  The review examines different fissionable isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, comparing their fission yields and neutron emission characteristics, which significantly influence reactor design and operational safety.  Furthermore, the complex interplay of prompt and delayed neutrons is discussed, emphasizing their impact on reactor control and the potential for criticality accidents.  Challenges related to nuclear waste management, including the long-term storage of high-level radioactive waste, are acknowledged as crucial considerations for the responsible implementation of fission-based technologies.  Future research directions are briefly touched upon, focusing on advanced reactor designs aimed at enhancing safety, efficiency, and waste minimization.  The continuing relevance of nuclear fission in addressing global energy demands necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the underlying physical processes and their associated implications.
