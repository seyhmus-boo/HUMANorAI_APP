Black hole formation is a consequence of gravitational collapse, occurring when a massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel.  The core, no longer supported by outward radiation pressure, implodes under its own gravity.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), even neutron degeneracy pressure fails to halt the collapse, leading to the formation of a singularity â€“ a point of infinite density.  Surrounding this singularity is an event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

Recent advancements in gravitational wave astronomy, through detectors like LIGO and Virgo, have provided crucial observational evidence. The detection of merging black holes has confirmed theoretical predictions about their existence and dynamics, offering insights into their masses and spins. Numerical relativity simulations, coupled with these observations, are refining our understanding of the black hole merger process, shedding light on the formation of more massive black holes through hierarchical mergers.  Furthermore, studies of active galactic nuclei suggest that supermassive black holes, millions or billions of solar masses, reside at the centers of most galaxies, potentially forming through a combination of stellar-mass black hole mergers and direct gas accretion. These ongoing observational and computational efforts continue to refine our understanding of black hole formation and evolution across cosmic scales.
