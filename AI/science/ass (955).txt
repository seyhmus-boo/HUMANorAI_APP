Quantum entanglement, a quintessential feature of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical physics, wherein systems are characterized by independent, locally defined properties.  Instead, entangled systems exhibit a holistic interdependence; their individual states are undefined until a measurement is performed on at least one of them. Upon measurement of a specific observable on one entangled particle, the corresponding observable of the other particle is instantaneously determined, regardless of the spatial separation between them. This instantaneous correlation, seemingly violating the principle of locality, does not enable faster-than-light communication as the outcome of the measurement on the first particle remains random and unpredictable.  Mathematically, entanglement is represented by a composite quantum state that cannot be expressed as a product of individual states for each subsystem.  The density matrix formalism provides a powerful tool for characterizing the degree of entanglement, with pure states representing maximally entangled systems and mixed states representing varying degrees of entanglement.  Understanding entanglement is crucial for advancements in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation, exploiting the fundamentally non-classical correlations between entangled particles.
