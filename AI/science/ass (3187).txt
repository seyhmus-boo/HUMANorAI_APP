Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms arranged in hexagons.  These properties are largely determined by their chirality (the angle of the hexagonal lattice relative to the nanotube axis) and diameter, which dictate whether the nanotube is metallic or semiconducting.

Their high aspect ratio results in extraordinary mechanical strength and stiffness, exceeding that of steel by a significant margin.  This, coupled with their low density, renders them ideal for reinforcing composites.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, comparable to copper, with metallic nanotubes exhibiting ballistic electron transport.  Their thermal conductivity is also remarkably high, surpassing that of diamond in some cases.  Finally, their large surface area-to-volume ratio makes them attractive for applications in energy storage and catalysis.  The precise control and manipulation of these properties remain a key area of ongoing research, with potential applications spanning electronics, materials science, and medicine.
