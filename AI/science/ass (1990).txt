Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, represent a class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties that have captivated scientific and engineering communities for decades.  Their unique structure, analogous to a rolled-up sheet of graphene – a single layer of graphite – bestows upon them a remarkable combination of mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  Imagine a single strand of spaghetti, incredibly strong and flexible; this simplistic analogy captures the high tensile strength and flexibility of CNTs, significantly exceeding that of steel.  However, unlike spaghetti, their electrical conductivity can be tuned from metallic to semiconducting depending on their chirality, analogous to a switch controlling the flow of electricity.  This tunability, coupled with their high thermal conductivity – think of a super-efficient heat pipe – makes them ideal candidates for a wide range of applications.  This paper will delve into the detailed examination of these remarkable properties, exploring the structure-property relationships governing their behaviour and highlighting the challenges and opportunities presented by their unique characteristics for future technological advancements.  We will specifically focus on the influence of chirality, diameter, and defects on their overall performance.
