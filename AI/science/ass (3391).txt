Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy.  Imagine a highly unstable, tightly wound spring representing the nucleus.  This spring, due to the strong nuclear force, is under immense internal pressure.  When a neutron, analogous to a small trigger, strikes the nucleus, it disrupts the internal equilibrium.  This disruption, akin to releasing the spring's tension, causes the nucleus to violently fracture.  

The resulting fragments, the lighter nuclei, possess considerable kinetic energy, analogous to the spring's recoil after release. This kinetic energy manifests as heat, which can be harnessed for electricity generation.  Crucially, the fission process also liberates additional neutrons. These neutrons, acting as further triggers, can initiate further fission events in a chain reaction, similar to a domino effect.  This chain reaction is carefully controlled in nuclear reactors to maintain a sustained energy release.  Uncontrolled chain reactions, as in nuclear weapons, lead to a rapid and explosive release of energy.  The precise control and management of this chain reaction are paramount for the safe and efficient utilization of nuclear fission.
