Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns chemical bonding and its influence on molecular structure.  Essentially, atoms, like social butterflies at a party, strive for stability. This stability is achieved through chemical bonding, the "networking" between atoms.  Think of ionic bonds as a rather forceful relationship: one atom, highly electronegative, essentially *steals* an electron from a less electronegative partner, creating a strong electrostatic attraction, much like a magnetic clasp.  Covalent bonds, conversely, are more collaborative partnerships; atoms *share* electrons, creating a strong bond analogous to two people holding hands.  The number and type of bonds dictate the molecule's three-dimensional structure, its geometry.  Consider methane (CHâ‚„): the carbon atom, in the centre, forms four covalent bonds with hydrogen atoms, arranged in a tetrahedral structure, like four legs of a stable chair.  Understanding these fundamental bonding principles and their geometric consequences is crucial for predicting a molecule's properties and reactivity.  Any questions?
