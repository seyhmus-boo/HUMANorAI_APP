Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the intricate interplay of the strong and electromagnetic forces acting on its constituent nucleons.  A quantum mechanical description necessitates consideration of the wavefunctions of these nucleons, constrained within a potential well defined by the nuclear forces.  The shape and energy of these wavefunctions determine the overall nuclear binding energy.  Spontaneous fission occurs when the quantum tunneling probability through the potential barrier separating the initial bound state from the separated fission fragments becomes significant.  This probability is strongly influenced by the nuclear deformation, which itself is a quantum mechanical property.  Induced fission, triggered by neutron absorption, introduces additional energy into the system, exciting the nucleus to a higher energy state, thereby increasing the likelihood of overcoming the fission barrier via tunneling.  The resulting fragments are not predetermined but rather follow a statistical distribution governed by the quantum mechanical probabilities associated with various decay pathways.  Detailed calculations require complex many-body quantum mechanical models incorporating both the strong and weak interactions, highlighting the intrinsically quantum nature of this process.
