Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses under its own immense gravity.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), even neutron degeneracy pressure cannot withstand the inward pull, leading to the formation of a singularity and an event horizon â€“ the defining characteristics of a black hole.  This process is theoretically well-understood through general relativity, predicting the emission of gravitational waves during the collapse.

However, experimentally verifying this process presents significant challenges. Directly observing the collapse itself is currently impossible, as the event horizon obscures the interior.  Gravitational wave detection, though a revolutionary tool, provides indirect evidence, mostly focusing on the merger of pre-existing black holes rather than the initial collapse.  Furthermore, accurately measuring the properties of the progenitor star before collapse is difficult due to obscuring dust and gas.  Precisely determining the mass of the collapsed core also remains a challenge, requiring sophisticated modeling and analysis of observational data from electromagnetic emissions and gravitational waves.  Ultimately, a comprehensive experimental confirmation of black hole formation from stellar collapse remains a significant ongoing endeavor in astrophysical research.
