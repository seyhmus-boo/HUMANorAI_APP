Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy and gamma radiation.  This energy release stems from the mass defect: the combined mass of the daughter nuclei is slightly less than the parent nucleus, with the "missing" mass converted to energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  The fission process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, which causes the unstable nucleus to undergo fission.  Crucially, this process also releases further neutrons, leading to a chain reaction if a sufficient critical mass of fissile material is present.

The controlled chain reaction forms the basis of nuclear power generation.  Nuclear reactors utilize control rods to moderate the reaction rate, harnessing the released heat to generate steam and drive turbines for electricity production.  Uncontrolled chain reactions, conversely, are the principle behind nuclear weapons, where the rapid release of energy causes a devastating explosion.  Beyond power generation and weaponry, fission products are also used in various applications, including medical isotopes for diagnosis and treatment, and industrial gauges for material analysis.  Despite its powerful applications, managing the radioactive waste generated by fission remains a significant challenge.
