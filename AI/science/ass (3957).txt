DNA replication, the process by which genetic information is faithfully duplicated, is fundamental to all life.  This process, remarkably precise yet remarkably fast, is orchestrated by a complex interplay of enzymes and proteins.  While the basic mechanism is well-established, ongoing research continues to uncover subtle nuances and variations across different organisms and cellular contexts. This paper reviews current understanding of eukaryotic DNA replication, focusing on key aspects including the initiation, elongation, and termination phases. We examine the roles of essential enzymes such as helicases, primases, DNA polymerases, and ligases, highlighting recent advancements in our understanding of their individual contributions and coordinated actions.  Furthermore, we explore the critical mechanisms that ensure high-fidelity replication, including proofreading and mismatch repair pathways.  Finally, the review considers the implications of replication errors and their contribution to genomic instability and disease, and discusses recent technological advances enabling deeper investigations into this intricate process.  A comprehensive understanding of DNA replication is crucial for progress in numerous fields, including cancer biology, genetic engineering, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
