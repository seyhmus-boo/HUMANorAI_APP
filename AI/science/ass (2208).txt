Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a crucial process underpinning both energy production and national security. This presentation offers a concise overview of the fundamental physics governing fission, focusing on the interplay between nuclear forces, binding energy, and the probability of fission events. We will explore the role of criticality, chain reactions, and neutron moderation in reactor design and operation.  Key fissionable isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, will be discussed, highlighting their differing properties and implications for reactor performance and waste management.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly address the various fission products generated and their associated challenges regarding radioactive waste disposal.  A comparative analysis of different reactor designs, including thermal and fast reactors, will touch upon their respective advantages and drawbacks concerning efficiency, safety, and proliferation resistance. Finally, we will briefly discuss the ongoing research into advanced reactor technologies aimed at enhancing safety, efficiency, and minimizing waste production, paving the way for a sustainable nuclear energy future.
