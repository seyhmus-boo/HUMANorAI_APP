DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring genetic inheritance, presents significant experimental challenges despite decades of research. This presentation will explore key difficulties encountered in studying this intricate machinery.  High-fidelity replication, crucial for maintaining genome integrity, is difficult to dissect experimentally due to the inherent robustness of the replication fork.  Analyzing the dynamics of the replisome in real-time remains a significant hurdle, with current techniques often limited by resolution and invasiveness.  Furthermore, studying replication in complex, multi-chromosomal genomes presents unique challenges compared to simpler model systems.  The presentation will discuss the limitations of in vitro reconstitution assays, highlighting the difficulty in recapitulating the complexities of the in vivo environment.  We will also address challenges in studying replication stress responses, particularly the dynamic interplay between various repair pathways and their impact on replication fork progression.  Finally, the presentation will touch upon emerging technologies, such as single-molecule approaches and advanced imaging techniques, offering potential solutions to overcome some of these experimental limitations and provide a deeper understanding of DNA replication's intricate mechanisms.
