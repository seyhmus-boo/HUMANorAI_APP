This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes viewed through the lens of quantum mechanics.  While classical physics can describe the macroscopic outcome of fission—the splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter fragments—a complete understanding necessitates a quantum mechanical framework.  We will explore the role of quantum tunneling in overcoming the Coulomb barrier, highlighting its crucial role in initiating the fission process.  The presentation will discuss the crucial influence of nuclear shell structure and the associated quantum numbers on fission fragment distributions, demonstrating how the quantum states of the initial nucleus dictate the probability of various fission pathways.  Furthermore, we will examine the collective modes of nuclear excitation, specifically focusing on vibrational and rotational excitations, and their impact on the timing and dynamics of fission.  Finally, the presentation will briefly address the challenges and future directions in applying advanced quantum many-body methods, such as time-dependent density functional theory, to accurately model and predict fission observables with improved precision.  This ultimately aids in advancing our understanding of nuclear reactor design and the development of advanced nuclear fuel cycles.
