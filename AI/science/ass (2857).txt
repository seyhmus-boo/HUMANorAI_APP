Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is a fundamental process underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry.  This lecture explores the mechanism of fission, focusing on the induced fission of uranium-235, a commonly utilized fissile isotope.  Neutron bombardment initiates the process, overcoming the strong nuclear force and inducing instability.  The resulting fission fragments exhibit a broad mass distribution, typically characterized by a bimodal curve.  Crucially, this process releases a significant amount of energy, primarily manifested as kinetic energy of the fragments and prompt neutrons.  These neutrons, in turn, can induce further fission events, leading to a chain reaction. The lecture details the criticality condition, where the neutron multiplication factor exceeds unity, sustaining the chain reaction.  Furthermore, delayed neutrons, emitted following the decay of fission products, play a crucial role in reactor control.  Finally, the lecture addresses the significance of neutron moderation and control mechanisms in managing the chain reaction for both energy production and weapon applications.
