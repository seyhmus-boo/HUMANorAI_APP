Photosynthesis, the process underpinning almost all life on Earth, has captivated scientists for centuries.  Early observations, dating back to the 17th century with Jan van Helmontâ€™s willow tree experiment, laid the groundwork for understanding plant growth.  However, it wasn't until the 19th century that crucial breakthroughs, such as Julius von Sachs' demonstration of starch formation in chloroplasts and Engelmann's identification of the specific wavelengths of light used in photosynthesis, provided a more mechanistic framework.

This presentation will offer a concise overview of modern understanding of photosynthetic mechanisms.  We will explore the two main stages: the light-dependent reactions, focusing on the role of photosystems II and I in generating ATP and NADPH, and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle), detailing carbon fixation and the subsequent synthesis of carbohydrates.  The discussion will include variations in photosynthetic pathways, such as C4 and CAM photosynthesis, highlighting their adaptations to different environmental conditions.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon ongoing research into enhancing photosynthetic efficiency for potential applications in biofuel production and climate change mitigation.  This presentation aims to provide a contemporary perspective on a process as fundamental and vital as photosynthesis, while acknowledging its rich and fascinating history.
