DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is a fundamental biological process crucial for cell division and heredity.  This semiconservative mechanism ensures accurate transmission of genetic information to daughter cells.  Initiation involves unwinding of the double helix at origins of replication by helicases, aided by single-stranded binding proteins that prevent reannealing.  DNA primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate leading and lagging strand synthesis.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase seals the resulting nicks in the lagging strand, creating a continuous DNA molecule.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity inherent in DNA polymerases and various mismatch repair mechanisms.  Errors, though rare, can lead to mutations with potential phenotypic consequences.  Understanding the intricate mechanisms of DNA replication remains crucial for comprehending both normal cellular function and the pathogenesis of various diseases.
