Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties rendering them promising candidates for diverse technological applications. This presentation will overview the key characteristics of CNTs, focusing on their remarkable mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, and unique thermal properties.  We will discuss the distinctions between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), highlighting the influence of chirality and diameter on their electronic and mechanical behavior.  Furthermore, the presentation will explore the inherent challenges associated with CNT processing, such as dispersion and functionalization, and their impact on practical applications.  Examples of current and emerging applications will be presented, including advanced composites for aerospace and automotive industries, high-performance energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors), highly sensitive sensors, and targeted drug delivery systems.  We will conclude by examining future research directions aimed at overcoming existing limitations and unlocking the full potential of CNTs in diverse technological domains.
