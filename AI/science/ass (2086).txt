Quantum entanglement, a fundamentally non-classical phenomenon, arises from the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of multi-particle quantum states.  Two or more particles become entangled when their combined quantum state cannot be factored into individual states for each particle. This means that the particles' properties, such as spin or polarization, are correlated in a way that surpasses classical correlations.  Measurements performed on one entangled particle instantaneously influence the measurable properties of the other, regardless of the spatial separation between them. This correlation is not due to any classical communication or hidden variables, as demonstrated by Bell's theorem and subsequent experimental verification.  The entangled state exists as a superposition of different possibilities until a measurement is performed on one particle, causing the wave function to collapse into a definite state for both particles.  The specific outcome of this collapse is probabilistic, dictated by the coefficients in the entangled wavefunction, yet the correlation between the outcomes remains perfect.  This non-local correlation forms the basis for numerous applications in quantum information science, including quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
