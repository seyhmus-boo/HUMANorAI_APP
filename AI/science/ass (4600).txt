Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, relies on two primary mechanisms: light-dependent and light-independent reactions.  The light-dependent reactions, occurring within thylakoid membranes, involve photosystems I and II.  Photon absorption excites chlorophyll molecules, initiating an electron transport chain that generates ATP and NADPH.  Water splitting provides electrons and releases oxygen as a byproduct.  This electron flow establishes a proton gradient, driving ATP synthase to produce ATP via chemiosmosis.

The light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, occur in the stroma.  Utilizing ATP and NADPH generated during the light-dependent phase, the cycle fixes atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic molecules, primarily glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P).  This process involves carboxylation, reduction, regeneration of the RuBP acceptor molecule, and ultimately the synthesis of carbohydrates.  Enzyme activity, particularly RuBisCO, and substrate availability significantly influence the efficiency of the Calvin cycle.  Environmental factors like light intensity, CO2 concentration, and temperature modulate the rate of both reaction phases, impacting overall photosynthetic output.
