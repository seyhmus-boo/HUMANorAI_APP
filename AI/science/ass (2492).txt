Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, present significant challenges for experimental characterization.  Their high aspect ratio and tendency to aggregate hinder accurate measurement of individual nanotube properties.  Precise determination of chirality, crucial for predicting electronic behavior, remains a significant hurdle, relying on techniques like Raman spectroscopy and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) which are prone to error and limited by sample preparation.  Moreover, obtaining highly pure, well-defined CNT samples is experimentally demanding, with impurities significantly affecting measured properties.  Measuring mechanical properties necessitates the development of specialized techniques to avoid nanotube damage during testing, while accurate thermal conductivity measurement requires overcoming challenges associated with phonon boundary scattering and contact resistance.  Quantifying the effects of defects and dopants, invariably present in synthesized samples, further complicates accurate property determination.  These experimental challenges necessitate the development of advanced characterization methods and sophisticated data analysis techniques to fully exploit the potential of CNTs in various applications.
