Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into smaller nuclei.  This process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the unstable nucleus to undergo fission.  The resulting fragments, termed fission products, possess significantly less mass than the original nucleus; this mass difference is converted into a substantial release of energy, primarily as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  The liberated neutrons can then induce further fission events in surrounding nuclei, creating a chain reaction. This chain reaction can be controlled in nuclear reactors, allowing for a sustained release of energy for electricity generation.  Uncontrolled chain reactions, as seen in nuclear weapons, lead to a rapid and catastrophic release of energy.  Beyond electricity production, fission processes find application in the production of medical radioisotopes used in diagnostics and treatments, such as in cancer therapy.  Further, the intense neutron fluxes generated in fission reactors are utilized for materials science research and neutron activation analysis.  The potential for both beneficial applications and devastating consequences highlights the critical need for careful management and responsible application of this powerful process.
