DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is a fundamental biological process crucial for cell division and heredity.  This review summarizes the key aspects of this intricate mechanism, highlighting its remarkable fidelity and speed.  The process begins with origin recognition and unwinding of the double helix by helicases, stabilized by single-strand binding proteins.  Primase then synthesizes RNA primers, providing a starting point for DNA polymerase III, which catalyzes the leading and lagging strand synthesis in a 5' to 3' direction.  The lagging strand necessitates the discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments, requiring repeated primer initiation and subsequent removal by nucleases. DNA polymerase I then fills the gaps left by primer removal. Finally, DNA ligase seals the phosphodiester backbone, completing replication.  Multiple proofreading mechanisms, including the 3' to 5' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerases, ensure high replication fidelity.  This review also touches upon the complexities of eukaryotic replication, including the involvement of multiple replication origins and the coordinated action of numerous proteins.  Further research is needed to fully elucidate the regulation and control of this essential process, particularly in the context of aging and disease.
