Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is a complex process fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The stability of a nucleus is determined by the interplay of the strong and Coulomb forces, described by the nuclear potential, a complex, many-body quantum system intractable via analytical solutions.  Approximation methods, such as the shell model and the liquid drop model, offer valuable insights into nuclear structure and fission dynamics.  The crucial role of quantum tunneling enables the nucleus to overcome the potential barrier separating it from the fission fragments, even with insufficient classical energy.  The probability of tunneling, and thus the fission rate, is highly sensitive to the shape of the potential energy surface, which is influenced by factors like nuclear deformation and nucleon pairing.  Furthermore, the distribution of fission fragment yields reflects the underlying quantum states of the fissioning nucleus and the subsequent decay processes.  Advanced theoretical treatments, employing density functional theory and Monte Carlo methods, continue to refine our understanding of these quantum phenomena and their impact on the dynamics and outcome of nuclear fission.  Further research is needed to fully capture the interplay between collective and single-particle motions in the fission process.
