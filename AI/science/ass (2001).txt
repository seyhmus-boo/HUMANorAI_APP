Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in stellar evolution, dictated by the interplay of gravity and internal pressure.  This lecture will outline the primary pathways to black hole genesis.  For stars significantly exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit (approximately 1.4 solar masses), core collapse following exhaustion of nuclear fuel is the dominant mechanism.  The implosion generates a supernova, leaving behind a compact remnant.  If the stellar core mass surpasses the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (approximately 2-3 solar masses), even neutron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to counter gravitational collapse, resulting in the formation of a stellar-mass black hole.  Alternatively, supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, are believed to form through a variety of processes, including the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe or the accretion and merging of stellar-mass black holes and intermediate-mass black holes.  Observational evidence, including gravitational wave detection from merging black holes and the dynamics of galactic nuclei, strongly supports these formation scenarios.  Further research is needed to refine our understanding of the detailed physics governing these processes, particularly in the context of supermassive black hole formation.
