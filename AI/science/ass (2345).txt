The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including their high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity, and exceptional thermal conductivity, have spurred significant research interest.  However, realizing the full potential of CNTs in practical applications remains hampered by several experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT growth, specifically achieving a high yield of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) with desired chirality and length, remains a significant hurdle.  Current synthesis methods, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), often produce a heterogeneous mixture of CNTs with varying structural parameters, demanding complex and often inefficient purification procedures.  Furthermore, accurately characterizing the structural and electronic properties of individual CNTs within a heterogeneous sample presents a considerable analytical challenge, requiring advanced techniques like Raman spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) that can be time-consuming and demanding in terms of sample preparation and data interpretation.  Finally, the inherent tendency of CNTs to aggregate due to van der Waals forces complicates their dispersion in various matrices, limiting their effective integration into composite materials and devices. Addressing these experimental challenges is paramount to unlocking the transformative potential of CNTs across diverse technological fields.
