Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of spatial separation.  This correlation transcends classical physics; the individual state of each entangled particle remains undefined until measurement, yet their combined state exhibits specific correlations.  According to quantum mechanics, this arises from the superposition principle.  Entangled particles exist not as individual entities with definite properties, but rather as a combined quantum state represented by a single wavefunction.  This wavefunction dictates the probabilities of observing specific outcomes upon measurement.

Upon measurement of one entangled particle, the wavefunction collapses, instantaneously defining the properties of both particles, even if separated by vast distances.  This instantaneous correlation does not violate causality as no information is transmitted faster than light; the correlation is pre-established in the entangled state prior to measurement. The observed correlations violate Bell's inequalities, demonstrating the fundamental incompatibility of entanglement with local realism â€“ the classical notion that systems possess definite properties independent of observation and that influences cannot propagate faster than light. The implications of entanglement extend to quantum computing and cryptography, leveraging these non-classical correlations for enhanced computational power and secure communication.
