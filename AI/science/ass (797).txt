Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics, describes the strong correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, manifesting as a non-local connection where the measurement outcome of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of its counterpart, even across vast distances. This seemingly paradoxical behavior, violating Bell's inequalities, has been experimentally verified numerous times.  The entangled state is described by a single wave function encompassing all entangled particles, defying a classical description of individual states.  Applications of entanglement are rapidly advancing, with significant potential in quantum computing, where entangled qubits enable the execution of algorithms impossible for classical computers.  Furthermore, entanglement underpins quantum cryptography, offering unconditionally secure communication channels through quantum key distribution.  Ongoing research explores the deeper implications of entanglement, including its role in understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics and its potential for novel technologies in quantum sensing and metrology.  Despite its experimental confirmation, the fundamental nature of non-locality and its relationship to spacetime remain subjects of ongoing debate and investigation.
