Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, remains a significant area of scientific study and technological application. This review summarizes the fundamental principles governing fission processes, focusing on the key role of neutron interactions and the resulting energy release.  The mechanism, including prompt and delayed neutron emission, is discussed, highlighting its influence on reactor control and criticality.  Different fissionable isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, exhibit varying fission yields and neutron emission characteristics, significantly impacting reactor design and operational parameters.  The review further examines the challenges associated with fission product management, including the handling of radioactive waste and the mitigation of proliferation risks.  While fission technology provides a substantial source of energy, concerns surrounding nuclear safety and the long-term consequences of radioactive waste necessitate ongoing research into improved reactor designs and waste management strategies. Future research should focus on advanced reactor concepts and the development of sustainable closed fuel cycles to enhance safety and minimize environmental impact.
