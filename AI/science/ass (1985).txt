Catalysts have revolutionised organic chemistry, enabling reactions previously deemed impractical or impossible.  Their historical significance dates back to the early 19th century, with Berzelius's initial concept of "catalytic force," though a mechanistic understanding remained elusive for decades.  Crucially, catalysts dramatically accelerate reaction rates by lowering the activation energy without themselves being consumed.  This is achieved through the formation of transient intermediates, modifying the reaction pathway and providing a lower-energy route to products.

In organic synthesis, catalysts are ubiquitous, spanning homogeneous systems, such as transition metal complexes employed in cross-coupling reactions (e.g., the palladium-catalysed Suzuki reaction), and heterogeneous systems, such as zeolites used in alkylation processes.  Their selectivity is often paramount, directing reactions towards specific isomers or functional group transformations, enhancing yield and minimizing waste.  Ongoing research focuses on developing more efficient, sustainable, and environmentally benign catalysts, particularly biocatalysts which harness the power of enzymes to perform complex reactions under mild conditions.
