Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), highlighting their interdisciplinary significance.  CNTs, essentially rolled-up sheets of graphene, exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, surpassing steel in tensile strength while being significantly lighter. This exceptional strength finds application in materials science, bolstering the development of high-performance composites for aerospace and automotive industries.

Furthermore, CNTs display unique electrical properties.  Depending on their chirality – the arrangement of carbon atoms – they can behave as metallic conductors or semiconductors, opening avenues for advanced electronics and nanoelectronics. This intersects with physics and electrical engineering, enabling the development of faster and smaller transistors and flexible electronics.  Their high aspect ratio and surface area also make them ideal for applications in energy storage (e.g., lithium-ion batteries) and catalysis, bridging chemistry and materials science.  Finally, their biocompatibility, a subject of ongoing research in bioengineering, offers potential for drug delivery systems and biosensors.  In summary, the remarkable properties of CNTs span multiple disciplines, driving innovation across a diverse range of technological fields.
