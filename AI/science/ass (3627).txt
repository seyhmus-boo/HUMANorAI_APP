Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, remains a significant challenge at the interface of general relativity and quantum mechanics.  While classical general relativity describes the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars leading to spacetime singularities, a complete understanding requires incorporating quantum effects.  This abstract addresses the crucial role of quantum phenomena in the final stages of stellar collapse and the subsequent black hole formation.  Specifically, we discuss the potential impact of quantum gravity effects, such as loop quantum gravity or string theory, on the singularity avoidance problem.  These theories propose modifications to general relativity at extremely high energy densities, potentially leading to the formation of a quantum “bounce” rather than a singularity, resulting in a regular black hole interior.  Furthermore, we explore the implications of Hawking radiation, a quantum mechanical phenomenon predicting black hole evaporation, challenging the classical notion of a singularity's permanence.  The interplay between gravitational collapse and quantum field theory in curved spacetime, including processes such as pair creation near the event horizon, warrants further investigation to refine our understanding of black hole thermodynamics and ultimately reconcile gravity with the quantum realm.  Future research focusing on semi-classical approaches and full quantum gravity calculations is critical for definitively characterizing the formation and properties of black holes.
