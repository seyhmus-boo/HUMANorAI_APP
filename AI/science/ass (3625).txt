Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, the fundamental process ensuring genetic inheritance.  Imagine DNA as a zip file containing all the instructions for building and maintaining an organism.  Replication is akin to making a perfect copy of this zip file.  The process begins with the unwinding of the double helix, like unzipping the file, exposing the two individual strands.  These strands then serve as templates.  Think of each template strand as a negative of a photograph; from it, we can create a positive.  

Enzymes, such as DNA polymerase, act as skilled copy machines, meticulously adding complementary nucleotides – the letters of the genetic code – to each template strand.  This process follows the base-pairing rules, ensuring an exact replica.  As the new strands are synthesised, they twist and wind together to form two identical double helices – two complete 'zip files'.  This semi-conservative mechanism ensures each new DNA molecule contains one original (parental) and one newly synthesised strand.  Any errors during this meticulous copying process can lead to mutations, altering the genetic information.
