Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of spatial separation.  This interconnectedness manifests as a correlation between the measurable properties of the entangled particles, exceeding any classical explanation.  Specifically, the combined quantum state of the entangled particles cannot be factored into individual states for each particle; instead, it's described by a single, entangled wave function.  Measurement of a specific observable on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the corresponding observable of the other, even across vast distances.  This does not, however, violate the principle of locality, as no information can be transmitted faster than the speed of light; the correlation is revealed only upon measurement.  The inherent non-classical nature of entanglement arises from the superposition principle, wherein particles exist in a probabilistic superposition of states until measurement forces a collapse to a definite state.  This collapse, inherently probabilistic, is correlated across the entangled system, leading to the observed strong correlations and defying intuitive classical interpretations.  Understanding and harnessing entanglement is crucial for advancements in quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
