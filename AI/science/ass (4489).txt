This presentation explores the formation of black holes through the lens of quantum mechanics, addressing the limitations of classical general relativity in describing the singularity and its immediate environs.  While classical models accurately depict the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, the singularity presents a fundamental breakdown of predictability.  We will examine the role of quantum effects, specifically focusing on how quantum gravity approaches might resolve the singularity problem.  This will include a discussion of potential mechanisms such as quantum fluctuations influencing the collapse process, the possibility of Planck-scale structures preventing singularity formation, and the implications of Hawking radiation on the final stages of black hole evolution.  Furthermore, we will explore the connection between black hole formation and information paradox, examining the proposed solutions involving information leakage through Hawking radiation or modifications to the spacetime structure at the event horizon.  Finally, the presentation will briefly address the relevance of ongoing and future research, such as observations of gravitational waves and high-energy astrophysical phenomena, in empirically testing and refining these quantum mechanical models of black hole formation.
