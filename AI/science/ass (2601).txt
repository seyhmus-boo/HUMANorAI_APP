Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional properties, exhibit remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics. Their cylindrical structure, composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices, underpins their unique behavior.  Mechanically, CNTs possess exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel, making them promising for high-strength composites.  Electrically, they can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality, offering potential for advanced nanoelectronics.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, crucial for applications in thermal management.

Recent developments focus on improving CNT synthesis and processing techniques for large-scale production and controlled functionalization.  Advances in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) have yielded higher purity and more uniform CNT arrays.  Furthermore, research into non-covalent functionalization strategies enables precise control over CNT dispersibility and interfacial interactions, critical for integrating them into various matrices.  Current research also explores the development of novel CNT-based devices, such as high-performance transistors and flexible sensors, driven by ongoing advancements in understanding their intricate structure-property relationships and exploring novel applications in energy storage and biomedical engineering.
