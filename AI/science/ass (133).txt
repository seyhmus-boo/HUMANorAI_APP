Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for various applications. However, realizing this potential is significantly hampered by experimental challenges.  A major hurdle lies in the inherent heterogeneity of CNT samples produced via current synthesis methods, resulting in a wide distribution of diameters, lengths, and structural defects. This variability complicates the accurate characterization of their properties and limits reproducibility across different studies.  Precise control over CNT growth parameters remains a significant challenge, hindering the synthesis of tailored CNTs with specific functionalities.

Furthermore, the strong van der Waals forces between individual CNTs lead to bundling, hindering their dispersion in solvents and matrices, thus affecting their processability and integration into devices.  Effective purification techniques to remove metallic CNTs or amorphous carbon impurities, crucial for many applications requiring high purity semiconducting CNTs, are still under development and often result in yield losses.  Finally, reliable and high-throughput techniques for characterizing individual CNT properties, especially electrical and mechanical properties, are needed to overcome the limitations posed by ensemble averaging measurements. Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for unlocking the full potential of CNTs in advanced technologies.
