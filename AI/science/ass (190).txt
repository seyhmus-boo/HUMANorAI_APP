Black hole formation represents a pivotal process in astrophysical evolution, marking the ultimate fate of sufficiently massive stars.  This presentation reviews the current understanding of stellar-mass black hole formation, focusing on the interplay between stellar structure, core collapse, and the subsequent supernova explosion. We will explore the crucial role of progenitor star properties, including mass, metallicity, and rotation, in determining the black hole mass and spin.  Recent advancements in numerical simulations, incorporating sophisticated treatments of hydrodynamics, neutrino transport, and magnetic fields, provide increasingly realistic models of the collapse process.  These simulations reveal diverse pathways to black hole formation, ranging from relatively clean explosions to highly disrupted events leading to failed supernovae.  Furthermore, we will address the challenges in observationally confirming theoretical predictions, highlighting the importance of multi-messenger astronomy – combining gravitational wave detections with electromagnetic observations – in probing the detailed characteristics of black hole formation.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the formation of supermassive black holes, examining current hypotheses involving direct collapse scenarios and the subsequent growth through accretion.
