Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized structure.  Their high aspect ratio results in extraordinary mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel, alongside remarkable flexibility and resilience.  Excellent electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, arises from delocalized Ï€-electrons.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.

Recent developments focus on enhancing these properties and exploring novel applications.  Advanced synthesis techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition and arc discharge, are yielding more controlled architectures with precise chirality and diameter, leading to improved functionalities.  Furthermore, research is investigating the integration of CNTs into composite materials, significantly improving mechanical strength, electrical and thermal conductivity, and creating lightweight yet durable structures.  Advances in functionalization strategies enable tailoring their surface chemistry for targeted applications in sensors, energy storage, and biomedical devices, showcasing the continuing evolution of CNT technology.
