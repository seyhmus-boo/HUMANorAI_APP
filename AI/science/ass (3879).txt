Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, regardless of spatial separation.  This linkage manifests as a correlation in their measurable properties, such as spin or polarization.  Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, seemingly violating the principles of locality inherent in classical physics.  This non-local correlation has profound implications across several disciplines.

In computer science, entanglement underpins quantum computing, enabling the creation of powerful algorithms exceeding the capabilities of classical computers.  Furthermore, quantum cryptography leverages entangled particles for secure communication, guaranteeing the detection of eavesdropping attempts.  In fundamental physics, entanglement provides crucial insights into the nature of spacetime and challenges our understanding of causality.  Moreover, studies in biology explore potential applications of entanglement in novel sensing technologies and possibly even the functioning of biological systems themselves.  The interdisciplinary nature of entanglement research highlights its potential to revolutionize various fields through the exploitation of quantum phenomena.
