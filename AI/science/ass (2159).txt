Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional material properties that have garnered significant research interest across diverse scientific disciplines.  This paper reviews the key physical and chemical properties of CNTs, focusing on their structure-property relationships.  We examine the influence of chirality and diameter on mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity, highlighting the discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.  Furthermore, we discuss the surface chemistry of CNTs, including functionalization strategies for enhancing dispersibility and reactivity in various applications.  The inherent challenges in synthesizing CNTs with controlled structural parameters and the complexities associated with characterizing their diverse morphologies are also addressed. This comprehensive review aims to provide a current understanding of the fundamental properties of CNTs, paving the way for the rational design and application of this remarkable material in advanced technologies, including composites, electronics, and energy storage.  Finally, we identify critical knowledge gaps and outline future research directions to further unlock the full potential of CNTs.
