Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic chemistry, enabling selective and efficient transformations that underpin the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, materials, and fine chemicals. This presentation will provide an overview of recent advancements in catalyst design and application, focusing on key areas of current interest. We will discuss the burgeoning field of single-atom catalysts (SACs), highlighting their exceptional atom utilization efficiency and unique catalytic properties, particularly in oxidation and hydrogenation reactions.  Furthermore, the increasing sophistication of photoredox catalysis will be explored, showcasing its ability to access unconventional reaction pathways and achieve challenging transformations with high selectivity.  The rise of bio-inspired catalysts, mimicking enzymatic activity through precise control of sterics and electronics, will also be addressed, emphasizing the potential for environmentally benign and sustainable catalysis.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the integration of machine learning and high-throughput screening techniques in catalyst discovery, accelerating the identification of highly active and selective catalysts for complex organic reactions. This presentation aims to illustrate the dynamic and rapidly evolving landscape of catalysis in organic chemistry and its crucial role in shaping the future of chemical synthesis.
