Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic chemistry, enabling efficient and selective transformations that would be otherwise impractical or impossible. This presentation will provide an overview of the diverse roles catalysts play in organic synthesis, focusing on their impact on reaction rates, selectivity, and atom economy.  We will explore different catalyst classes, including homogeneous catalysts (e.g., transition metal complexes, organocatalysts) and heterogeneous catalysts (e.g., zeolites, metal nanoparticles), highlighting their unique advantages and limitations.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the mechanistic aspects underpinning their catalytic activity, emphasizing the importance of understanding catalyst-substrate interactions for rational catalyst design.  Furthermore, the presentation will showcase practical applications of catalysis in the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. Examples will include asymmetric catalysis for the production of enantiomerically pure drugs, green catalytic processes for sustainable chemical manufacturing, and the use of heterogeneous catalysts in industrial-scale reactions.  The presentation aims to demonstrate the crucial role catalysis plays in shaping the future of organic chemistry and its contribution to solving global challenges.
