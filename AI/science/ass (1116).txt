Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition, describes a correlation between two or more quantum particles irrespective of the spatial separation between them.  This non-classical correlation implies that the particles' properties, such as spin or polarization, are intrinsically linked, exhibiting a holistic behavior. Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance, seemingly violating the principle of locality.  

This phenomenon has profound implications across multiple disciplines. In quantum computing, entangled qubits form the basis for powerful algorithms surpassing classical capabilities, with applications in cryptography and materials science.  Cosmology explores entanglement's role in the early universe, potentially offering insights into the origin of large-scale structure.  Furthermore, entanglement finds application in quantum metrology, enabling enhanced precision measurements surpassing classical limits.  The philosophical implications challenge our understanding of reality and causality, prompting interdisciplinary dialogue between physics, philosophy, and information science to grapple with the implications of non-locality and the nature of measurement.
