Black hole formation represents a critical juncture in stellar evolution and a fundamental process shaping galactic structure.  This paper investigates the diverse astrophysical mechanisms leading to the creation of stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  We review the currently accepted paradigm of stellar-mass black hole formation through the gravitational collapse of massive stars, exploring the influence of stellar metallicity, rotation, and binary interactions on the final outcome.  Furthermore, we address the ongoing debate surrounding the formation mechanisms of supermassive black holes, examining competing hypotheses such as direct collapse from primordial gas clouds and the growth of seed black holes through accretion and mergers.  The paper critically analyses observational evidence, including gravitational wave detections from merging black holes, X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei, and simulations of galaxy formation, to constrain the viability of different formation pathways. Ultimately, we aim to synthesize existing knowledge and highlight outstanding challenges in understanding the diverse origins and evolutionary trajectories of these enigmatic objects across cosmic timescales.
