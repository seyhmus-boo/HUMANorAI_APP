The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their unique quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp²-hybridized carbon atoms form a seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheet, resulting in a cylindrical structure with remarkable electronic properties.  Depending on the chirality – the angle of the graphene sheet’s roll – CNTs can exhibit metallic or semiconducting behaviour. This arises from the quantization of the electron momentum, leading to distinct one-dimensional energy bands.  Metallic nanotubes possess a linear energy dispersion near the Fermi level, facilitating high electron mobility.  Conversely, semiconducting nanotubes exhibit a band gap, the magnitude of which is dependent on the nanotube diameter and chirality.  Furthermore, the strong covalent bonding within the graphene lattice bestows high tensile strength and exceptional thermal conductivity, exceeding that of many other materials.  These quantum-mechanically dictated properties underpin CNTs' diverse applications in electronics, materials science, and nanotechnology.
