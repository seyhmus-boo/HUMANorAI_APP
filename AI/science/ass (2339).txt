The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are deeply rooted in their quantum mechanical nature.  Their sp² hybridized carbon atoms form a seamless cylindrical structure, resulting in a delocalized π-electron system extending along the nanotube axis.  This π-electron system governs the CNT's electronic properties, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on the chirality (helical arrangement of the carbon lattice) and diameter, a direct consequence of quantum confinement and the resulting band structure.  Tight-binding calculations accurately predict this band gap variation, demonstrating the crucial role of electron wavefunction overlap.  

Furthermore, the strong covalent bonding between carbon atoms contributes to their extraordinary mechanical strength and stiffness, reflected in high Young's modulus values.  The quantum mechanical description of these bonds elucidates the origin of this exceptional strength, attributable to the localized σ-bonds and the delocalized π-bonds, which also influence the vibrational modes and phonon dispersion, resulting in high thermal conductivity. The unique combination of these quantum mechanically determined properties makes CNTs highly promising for applications in nanoelectronics, composites, and energy storage, highlighting the importance of a quantum mechanical understanding for optimizing their functionality.
