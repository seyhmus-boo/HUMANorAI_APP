Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, a fundamental process crucial for cellular proliferation.  The classic model, semi-conservative replication, remains the cornerstone of our understanding, whereby each parental strand serves as a template for a new complementary strand.  However, recent advancements have refined this model.  High-throughput sequencing has revealed the complexities of replication origins, demonstrating their heterogeneous nature and dynamic regulation, challenging the notion of fixed initiation sites.

Furthermore, studies utilizing single-molecule techniques have provided unprecedented insights into the dynamics of the replication fork, showing its inherent instability and susceptibility to pausing and stalling, often mediated by obstacles like DNA lesions.  Advancements in CRISPR-Cas9 technology now allow for targeted manipulation of replication origins and proteins, facilitating mechanistic investigations.  Finally,  research into alternative DNA polymerases and their roles in bypassing replication blocks is illuminating mechanisms of error correction and tolerance, crucial for genomic stability.  These recent developments significantly expand our understanding beyond the initial Watson-Crick model.
