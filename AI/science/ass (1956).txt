Good morning. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a fascinating process within astrophysics.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  When a star many times the mass of our Sun exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core implodes under its own immense gravity.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, no known force can prevent further collapse, resulting in a singularity—a point of infinite density—surrounded by an event horizon, the point of no return.

Supermassive black holes, found at galactic centers, are significantly larger, their formation mechanisms remaining a topic of active research.  Possible scenarios include direct collapse of massive gas clouds or the merging of smaller black holes.

While direct observation of black holes is challenging, their gravitational influence allows indirect detection. Gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime predicted by Einstein's theory, are emitted during black hole mergers and detected by observatories such as LIGO and Virgo.  This provides crucial data for understanding black hole properties and refining our models.  Further applications arise in understanding galactic evolution and cosmology, as black holes play a significant role in shaping galactic structure and influencing the distribution of matter in the universe.
