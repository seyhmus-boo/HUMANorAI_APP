Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for diverse technological applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges related to their synthesis, characterization, and manipulation.  This paper focuses on the key experimental limitations encountered in the comprehensive study of CNT properties.  The inherent heterogeneity of CNT samples, including variations in diameter, chirality, and structural defects, presents a major obstacle to accurate property measurement.  Precise control over these parameters during synthesis remains elusive, leading to inconsistent results across different studies.  Furthermore, characterizing individual CNTs, especially their structural and electronic properties, requires advanced microscopy techniques with limitations in resolution and throughput.  The tendency of CNTs to aggregate, forming bundles and hindering individual analysis, adds further complexity.  Finally, manipulating and integrating CNTs into functional devices presents substantial challenges, particularly concerning the control of their alignment, dispersion, and interfacial interactions with other materials. Addressing these experimental limitations is crucial for unlocking the full potential of CNTs and achieving reliable, reproducible results for advancing their technological impact.
