Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic chemistry, enabling the synthesis of complex molecules with enhanced efficiency and selectivity. This presentation will provide an overview of the diverse roles catalysts play in organic transformations, focusing on key mechanistic aspects and recent advancements.  We will explore different catalyst classes, including homogeneous catalysts (e.g., transition metal complexes, organocatalysts) and heterogeneous catalysts (e.g., zeolites, metal nanoparticles), highlighting their respective advantages and limitations.  Specific examples will be drawn from important synthetic methodologies, such as cross-coupling reactions, asymmetric catalysis, and C-H functionalization, illustrating the impact of catalyst design on reaction outcomes. The discussion will also touch upon the growing importance of sustainable catalysis, encompassing the development of environmentally benign catalysts and reaction conditions. Finally, we will briefly address the challenges and future directions in catalyst research, particularly the need for greater efficiency, selectivity, and atom economy, alongside the development of novel catalytic systems for challenging transformations.  The presentation aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of this crucial area of organic chemistry for a broad audience.
