The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are deeply rooted in their quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp² hybridized carbon atoms form a seamless hexagonal lattice, resulting in a cylindrical structure with unique electronic characteristics.  Crucially, the chirality – the angle of the hexagonal lattice's orientation relative to the nanotube axis – dictates the electronic band structure.  Armchair nanotubes exhibit metallic conductivity, owing to the degeneracy of their valence and conduction bands at the Fermi level.  In contrast, zigzag and chiral nanotubes can display semiconducting behaviour, with a band gap that varies with their diameter and chirality. This quantum confinement effect, arising from the restricted dimensionality, significantly influences their electrical conductivity, making them suitable for diverse applications from nanoelectronics to sensors.  Furthermore, their strong covalent bonding and high aspect ratio contribute to exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, characteristics also influenced by subtle quantum effects relating to electron delocalization within the nanotube framework. The interplay of these quantum phenomena renders CNTs a remarkable material system with unparalleled potential.
