Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with unique cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms and high aspect ratio.  This review summarizes key physical and chemical properties influencing their diverse applications.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, with tensile moduli exceeding that of steel, arises from the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheets.  Remarkable electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, allows for applications in electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  Their large surface area enables significant adsorption capabilities, utilized in gas storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain, including efficient dispersion and functionalization for improved processability and integration into composite materials.  Ongoing research focuses on controlling CNT growth parameters to achieve precise chirality and diameter for targeted applications, as well as exploring their potential in advanced energy storage, biomedical devices, and high-performance composites.
