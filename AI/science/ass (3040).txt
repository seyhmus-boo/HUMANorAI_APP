Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon arising from the superposition principle, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical physics, wherein spatially separated entangled particles exhibit correlated properties regardless of the distance separating them.  Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of its entangled partner, seemingly violating the principle of locality.  This instantaneous correlation is not exploitable for faster-than-light communication due to the inherent randomness of quantum measurement outcomes.  Bell's theorem rigorously demonstrates the incompatibility of quantum entanglement with local realism, experimentally validated numerous times using various systems, including photons, ions, and superconducting circuits.  Ongoing research explores applications of entanglement in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum metrology, leveraging the unique properties of entangled states for improved computational power, enhanced security protocols, and increased measurement precision.  Further investigation into the fundamental nature of entanglement remains a crucial frontier in advancing our understanding of quantum mechanics and its technological implications.
