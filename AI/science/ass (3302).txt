Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, is analogous to a carefully balanced, highly energetic stack of dominoes.  The nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, represents this precarious structure.  Introducing a neutron, a single domino topple, initiates a chain reaction.  This neutron impact overcomes the strong nuclear force holding the nucleus together, causing it to fission into smaller, lighter nuclei â€“ like the stack collapsing into many smaller, individual dominoes.  

This fission releases a tremendous amount of energy, analogous to the kinetic energy released as the dominoes fall. This energy manifests primarily as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and the release of further neutrons, which, in turn, trigger the fission of more nuclei, sustaining the chain reaction.  Control over this reaction, crucial for power generation, is achieved through moderators (like strategically placed obstacles slowing down the dominoes' fall) and control rods (like removing sections of the dominoes' chain to limit the cascading effect).  Without careful control, the uncontrolled chain reaction, analogous to an uncontrolled domino effect, leads to a rapid exponential release of energy, as seen in nuclear weapons. Therefore, understanding the precise mechanics of nuclear fission and controlling the chain reaction is paramount for both energy production and safety.
