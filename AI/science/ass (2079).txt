Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition.  Two or more entangled particles exhibit correlated properties, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  Measurement of a property on one particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the others, seemingly violating locality. This correlation, however, is not exploitable for faster-than-light communication, a point crucial to understanding its implications.

Recent developments have significantly advanced our understanding and application of entanglement.  Advances in quantum computing leverage entangled qubits for superior computational power, with progress witnessed in error correction codes and the development of larger-scale entangled systems. Moreover, advancements in quantum key distribution (QKD) utilize entangled photons to create unconditionally secure communication channels, resisting eavesdropping attempts.  Furthermore, studies are exploring the role of entanglement in fundamental physics, potentially shedding light on gravity and the nature of spacetime itself.  Despite the many open questions, the continued exploration of entanglement promises revolutionary technological and scientific breakthroughs.
