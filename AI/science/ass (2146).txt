Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission.  Imagine an atom's nucleus as a meticulously constructed, highly energetic ball of marbles – these marbles representing protons and neutrons.  In fission, we introduce a neutron, a small marble, into this carefully balanced system.  This incoming marble acts as a trigger, disrupting the internal structure, causing the whole “ball” to become unstable.

This instability leads to the nucleus splitting, much like a perfectly balanced stack of blocks toppling when disturbed. The resulting smaller “balls” – fission fragments – are inherently less massive than the original, with the difference in mass converted into enormous amounts of energy, according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².  This energy release manifests as kinetic energy of the fragments, as well as the release of further neutrons, acting as chain reaction initiators, potentially triggering further fission events in nearby nuclei – a cascading effect similar to a row of dominoes falling.  Control of this chain reaction is crucial in harnessing the energy for power generation while preventing uncontrolled exponential growth, which would lead to a catastrophic event.
