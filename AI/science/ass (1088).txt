DNA replication, the fundamental process of life, transcends the boundaries of classical molecular biology.  This presentation explores the interdisciplinary connections underpinning our understanding of this crucial process, highlighting the contributions of physics, chemistry, and computer science.  We will examine how biophysical techniques, such as single-molecule manipulation and fluorescence microscopy, reveal the mechanics of replication fork progression and the dynamics of protein-DNA interactions at high resolution.  The intricate chemical reactions driving nucleotide incorporation and proofreading will be discussed, emphasizing the role of metal ions and the precise stereochemistry involved.  Furthermore, we will showcase the crucial role of computational biology in modeling replication processes, from predicting the structure and function of replication proteins to simulating genome-wide replication timing and its impact on epigenetic regulation.  Finally, we will discuss how interdisciplinary approaches are crucial for addressing contemporary challenges such as understanding replication stress response and developing novel therapeutic strategies for cancer targeting replication machinery.  This presentation aims to underscore the power of interdisciplinary collaboration in advancing our knowledge of DNA replication and its implications for human health.
