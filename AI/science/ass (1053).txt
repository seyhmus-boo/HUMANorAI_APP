Catalysts, substances that accelerate reaction rates without being consumed, are indispensable in organic chemistry.  Their historical significance is undeniable, with early examples including the use of sulfuric acid in esterification, documented centuries ago. However, the systematic understanding of catalysis emerged later, notably with Berzelius's 1835 proposition of "catalytic force".

In organic chemistry, catalysts are employed to overcome high activation energies, enabling reactions that would otherwise proceed too slowly or not at all under practical conditions. They achieve this by providing alternative reaction pathways with lower activation barriers.  This is manifested through diverse mechanisms, including acid-base catalysis, where proton transfer facilitates bond breaking and formation, and metal catalysis, where transition metals facilitate redox reactions or coordinate reactive intermediates.  Modern organic synthesis extensively relies on transition metal catalysts such as palladium and rhodium, pivotal in cross-coupling reactions and asymmetric hydrogenations, respectively.  The development of highly selective and efficient catalysts remains a central focus in contemporary research, driving advancements in fields like pharmaceuticals and materials science.
