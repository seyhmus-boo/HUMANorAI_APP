Nuclear fission, a cornerstone of energy production and scientific research, presents significant experimental challenges despite its established theoretical framework. This presentation will explore key difficulties encountered in the precise measurement and modelling of fission processes.  We will focus on the inherent complexity of the fission fragment distribution, encompassing the broad range of mass, charge, and kinetic energy yields, and the associated difficulties in achieving comprehensive experimental characterization. The challenges related to prompt neutron emission, including their energy spectra and angular distributions, will be examined, highlighting the limitations of current detection techniques.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the difficulties in isolating and analyzing rare fission events, particularly those involving exotic isotopes and isomeric states. This is compounded by the high background radiation inherent in fission experiments, demanding sophisticated data analysis techniques to extract meaningful information.  Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss the prospects of advanced detection technologies and novel experimental approaches, such as utilizing intense, pulsed neutron sources and improved high-resolution detectors, to overcome these persistent challenges and advance our understanding of nuclear fission.
