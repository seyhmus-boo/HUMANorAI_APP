Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a crucial resource for emerging quantum technologies. This presentation will provide an overview of entanglement, focusing on recent advancements that push the boundaries of its understanding and application.  We will discuss significant progress in generating and manipulating entangled states, including the development of novel platforms such as trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonic systems, showcasing their respective strengths and limitations in achieving high-fidelity entanglement.  Furthermore, the presentation will explore recent breakthroughs in characterizing and quantifying entanglement, addressing challenges associated with noise and decoherence.  Specific examples will include advancements in entanglement witnessing and quantification techniques employing machine learning and novel theoretical frameworks.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the exciting prospects of utilizing high-dimensional and multipartite entanglement for enhanced quantum computation, communication, and sensing, highlighting the critical role of entanglement in driving the quantum revolution.
