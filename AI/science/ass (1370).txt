Black hole formation remains a cornerstone of astrophysical research, bridging stellar evolution with relativistic gravity.  This presentation will review the established pathways, focusing on the collapse of massive stars and the dynamics of binary systems.  While the former relies on core-collapse supernovae, recent numerical simulations employing advanced equation-of-state models are refining our understanding of the progenitor star characteristics and the subsequent explosion mechanisms crucial for black hole birth.  These simulations increasingly reveal the complexity of the process, highlighting the influence of rotation, magnetic fields, and neutrino transport on the final outcome, including the potential for failed supernovae resulting directly in black hole formation.

Regarding binary systems, the detection of gravitational waves by LIGO and Virgo has revolutionised our knowledge of merging black holes, providing observational constraints on their masses and spins.  These observations reveal a surprisingly high population of stellar-mass black holes, challenging some existing models of stellar evolution.  Furthermore, the study of active galactic nuclei (AGN) offers insight into supermassive black hole formation, with ongoing debates centred on direct collapse scenarios, mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and the role of early galaxy formation. This presentation will summarise these recent developments, highlighting the remaining open questions and future research directions in our quest to fully understand black hole formation across cosmic scales.
