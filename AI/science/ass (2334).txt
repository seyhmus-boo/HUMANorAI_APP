Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials exhibiting exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure.  Their cylindrical morphology, comprised of rolled-up graphene sheets, gives rise to a diverse range of characteristics.  Mechanically, CNTs demonstrate unparalleled tensile strength and stiffness, exceeding that of steel.  Electrically, depending on chirality, they can behave as either metallic conductors or semiconducting materials, opening possibilities for advanced electronics.  Thermally, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  Furthermore, their high surface area allows for significant adsorption capabilities, leading to applications in gas storage and sensing.  However, challenges remain in terms of large-scale, cost-effective production and controlling the precise chirality for tailored applications.  Despite these hurdles, the exceptional properties of CNTs continue to fuel extensive research across various fields, with ongoing efforts focused on harnessing their potential in diverse technological domains including composites, energy storage, and biomedical engineering.
