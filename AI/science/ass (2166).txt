Black hole formation is a consequence of extreme gravitational collapse.  Imagine a massive star, a celestial body many times larger than our Sun, as a giant, inflated balloon filled with incandescent gas.  Nuclear fusion, the star's internal furnace, counteracts the inward pull of gravity, maintaining hydrostatic equilibrium – a delicate balance.  However, when the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, this support mechanism fails.  The balloon, devoid of internal pressure, begins to implode under its own weight.

This implosion is not uniform; the core collapses first, reaching unimaginable densities.  Think of it as crumpling the balloon into an infinitely small point, a singularity.  The immense gravitational pull of this singularity traps everything within a certain radius, the event horizon – analogous to the balloon's now-collapsed surface, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  This marks the birth of a black hole, a region of spacetime with such intense gravity that it warps the fabric of the universe itself.  Whether the remnant is a stellar-mass black hole or a supermassive one depends on the initial mass of the progenitor star and subsequent accretion of matter.
