Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter fragments, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus arises from a complex interplay of the strong and Coulomb forces, governed by the nuclear potential well described by the Schr√∂dinger equation.  However, the many-body nature of the nucleus renders exact solutions intractable, necessitating the use of sophisticated approximations like the shell model and liquid drop model.  Spontaneous fission occurs when the quantum tunneling probability through the potential barrier separating the initial nucleus from the fission fragments becomes significant. This probability is highly sensitive to the nuclear shape and the associated potential energy surface, often explored through computational methods like density functional theory.  Induced fission, triggered by neutron absorption, introduces an additional energy input that deforms the nucleus, reducing the barrier height and thus increasing the tunneling probability.  The subsequent rapid expansion and subsequent scission into fragments is also driven by quantum effects, with the distribution of fission products reflecting the underlying energy landscape and nucleon pairing correlations, which influence the favored fragment mass ratios.  Consequently, a full understanding of fission relies on a nuanced combination of quantum mechanics and nuclear models.
