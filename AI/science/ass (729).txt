Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, underpins nearly all life on Earth.  Understanding its intricate mechanisms is crucial for addressing global challenges such as climate change and food security.  Early investigations, dating back to the 17th century with Jan Baptista van Helmont's experiments on willow trees,  laid the groundwork for understanding the role of water in plant growth.  However, it wasn't until the 18th and 19th centuries that the contributions of Joseph Priestley, Jan Ingenhousz, and Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure elucidated the involvement of air and light in the process, leading to the formulation of the overall equation for photosynthesis.  The 20th century witnessed a revolutionary advancement in our understanding, with the discovery of chlorophyll and the elucidation of the light-dependent and light-independent reactions – the latter often referred to as the Calvin cycle.  This paper delves into the current understanding of photosynthesis mechanisms, focusing on the intricate interplay between light harvesting complexes, electron transport chains, and carbon fixation pathways, including variations observed across different photosynthetic organisms. We will explore recent advancements in our knowledge, highlighting both established paradigms and emerging areas of research within this vital biological process.
