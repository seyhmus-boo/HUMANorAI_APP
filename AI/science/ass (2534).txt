Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of sp²-bonded carbon atoms, have captivated researchers since their discovery in 1991 by Iijima.  This landmark observation, building upon earlier theoretical predictions and the well-established field of fullerene research, unveiled a material with extraordinary properties poised to revolutionize numerous technological sectors.  Initially characterized by their unique morphology – either single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) – CNTs exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, exceeding that of steel by orders of magnitude, coupled with remarkable flexibility and a high aspect ratio.  Their electrical properties are equally intriguing, exhibiting characteristics ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality and diameter, a feature crucial for their potential in nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional thermal conductivity, contributing to their viability in thermal management applications.  This paper aims to comprehensively review the key properties of CNTs, focusing on their mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics, as well as exploring the influence of structural parameters and synthesis methods on these properties.  We will examine both experimental observations and theoretical modelling to provide a current understanding of this remarkable material and its potential for future advancements.
