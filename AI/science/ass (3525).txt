Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems.  Unlike classical correlations, which can be explained by pre-existing properties, entangled particles exhibit a non-local connection, instantaneously influencing each other's state regardless of the spatial separation.  Imagine two coins flipped simultaneously, but linked in such a way that if one lands heads, the other *must* land tails, no matter how far apart they are.  This inherent interconnectedness, however, transcends mere correlation.  The outcome of measuring one entangled particle's property, such as spin, instantly determines the corresponding property of the other, even if the measurement occurs light-years away. This "spooky action at a distance," as Einstein termed it, violates the principles of local realism, suggesting that either locality (independent influence of spatially separated systems) or realism (pre-existing properties) must be abandoned in the quantum realm.  The entangled particles do not possess definite properties prior to measurement; their states are only defined upon observation, reinforcing the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.  The strength of this entanglement is quantifiable and decays over time due to interactions with the environment, a process known as decoherence.
