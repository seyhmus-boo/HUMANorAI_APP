DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding stemmed from experiments demonstrating the semiconservative nature of replication, notably the Meselson-Stahl experiment (1958). This landmark study definitively showed that each new DNA molecule consists of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand, contradicting conservative and dispersive models.  The process is initiated at specific sites called origins of replication, where the DNA double helix unwinds, creating replication forks.  Helicases catalyze unwinding, while single-strand binding proteins stabilize the separated strands.  Primase synthesizes short RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase to initiate DNA synthesis, which occurs continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, generating Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase also possesses proofreading capabilities, minimizing replication errors.  Finally, ligase joins the Okazaki fragments, completing the replication process and generating two identical DNA molecules.  The fidelity of this process is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing mutations.
