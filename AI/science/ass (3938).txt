Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition. Imagine two coins, flipped simultaneously and separated by vast distances.  In classical physics, each coin's outcome – heads or tails – is independent.  Entanglement, however, is akin to these coins being magically linked.  Knowing one coin landed heads instantaneously tells us the other landed tails, regardless of the separation.

This "spooky action at a distance," as Einstein termed it, arises from the quantum superposition principle.  Before measurement, the entangled particles exist in a combined state, a superposition of all possible outcomes.  Measurement forces a collapse of this superposition, instantly determining the state of both particles.  Crucially, this isn't simply correlated data;  the particles' fates are intrinsically intertwined.  The information isn't transmitted faster than light; rather, the correlation pre-exists the measurement.  Understanding this entanglement is crucial for developing quantum technologies, from quantum computing to secure communication protocols.
