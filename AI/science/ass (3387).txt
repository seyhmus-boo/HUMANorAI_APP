Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, a fundamental process underpinning life.  Semiconservative replication, where each new DNA molecule retains one parental strand, remains the central dogma.  However, recent research has significantly refined our understanding of this process.

Traditionally, we emphasized the role of DNA polymerase in nucleotide addition.  Now, research highlights the crucial contributions of accessory proteins, like helicases and primases, in unwinding the double helix and initiating replication at specific origins.  Furthermore, advancements in single-molecule techniques are revealing the dynamic nature of replication forks, demonstrating fluctuations in speed and pausing events linked to DNA structure.  

Excitingly, studies employing advanced imaging techniques are visualizing the spatial organization of replication factories within the nucleus, challenging the simplistic view of randomly distributed replication sites.  These advancements underscore the complexity of DNA replication, revealing a highly regulated and orchestrated process far beyond the initial Watson-Crick model.  Further investigation into these areas promises to elucidate the mechanisms underlying replication fidelity and its contribution to genome instability.
