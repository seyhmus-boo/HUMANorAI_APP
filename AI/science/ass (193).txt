Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional material properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon lattice.  Their high aspect ratio, combined with strong covalent bonding, results in extraordinary tensile strength and Young's modulus, significantly exceeding those of steel.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable electrical conductivity, exhibiting metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality and diameter.  This tunable conductivity, coupled with high carrier mobility, makes them attractive for applications in electronics and sensors.  Their thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  However, the inherent van der Waals forces between individual nanotubes lead to aggregation, hindering their processability and necessitating functionalization strategies for optimal dispersion in various matrices.  Finally, the large surface area-to-volume ratio of CNTs contributes to their exceptional adsorption capabilities, making them promising candidates for applications in gas storage and catalysis.  Further research focuses on controlling the synthesis of CNTs with specific structural parameters to optimize their desired properties for diverse applications.
