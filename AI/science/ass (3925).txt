Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for diverse applications. However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges. This presentation will focus on these hurdles, categorized into synthesis, characterization, and processing.  Synthesis often yields heterogeneous mixtures of CNT types (single-walled, multi-walled, different chiralities), demanding complex purification techniques prone to damage or alteration of the desired CNT structures.  Characterization, crucial for understanding structure-property relationships, faces difficulties in obtaining precise and reliable measurements.  Techniques like Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, while informative, can be limited by sample preparation and interpretation complexities, particularly for discerning subtle structural variations impacting properties.  Furthermore, processing CNTs into macroscopic components presents considerable challenges due to their strong van der Waals interactions leading to aggregation and hindering dispersion in various matrices. This presentation will discuss advanced techniques addressing these challenges, including advanced purification strategies, high-resolution microscopy advancements, and novel processing methods, highlighting the ongoing efforts to overcome these limitations and fully unlock the potential of CNTs for technological advancements.
