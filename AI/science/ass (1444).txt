Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them promising candidates for diverse technological applications.  This presentation will overview the key properties governing CNT functionality, focusing on their remarkable strength and stiffness stemming from the strong covalent C-C bonds and their unique structural configuration.  We will explore the dependence of these properties on nanotube chirality and diameter, highlighting the distinction between metallic and semiconducting CNTs and their implications for electronic device fabrication.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the thermal conductivity of CNTs, demonstrating their potential as superior heat dissipators.  Challenges related to CNT synthesis, purification, and dispersion, crucial for realizing their full potential in practical applications, will also be discussed.  Finally, we will briefly examine current and emerging applications, such as advanced composites, energy storage devices, and nanoelectronics, showcasing the significant impact of CNT properties on material science and engineering.
