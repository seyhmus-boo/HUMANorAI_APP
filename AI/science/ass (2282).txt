Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, with ongoing investigations refining our understanding of the diverse pathways leading to these enigmatic objects.  The classical picture of stellar-mass black hole formation via the core-collapse of massive stars is being augmented by sophisticated numerical simulations incorporating improved equations of state and magnetic field effects.  These models are revealing the crucial role of rotation and magnetic fields in shaping the explosion dynamics and the resulting remnant, influencing the black hole's mass, spin, and kick velocity.  Furthermore, the detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers by LIGO and Virgo has provided unprecedented observational constraints on their populations and formation channels, indicating a significant fraction may originate from dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments.  Recent studies explore the formation of intermediate-mass black holes, a population bridging the gap between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes, potentially through runaway stellar collisions or the collapse of super-massive stars.  The discovery of  supermassive black holes at extremely high redshifts presents a challenge to current formation models, necessitating investigation of direct collapse scenarios and early universe processes.  Continued advancements in both numerical modeling and observational techniques promise to further elucidate the complex and multifaceted nature of black hole formation across cosmic time.
