Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical notions of locality, whereby the state of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of its entangled counterpart, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This instantaneous correlation, however, does not violate causality as it precludes the transmission of information faster than light.  Experimental verification of entanglement has been achieved across diverse platforms, including photons, trapped ions, and superconducting qubits, consistently demonstrating violations of Bell inequalities, thus ruling out local hidden variable theories. The degree of entanglement is quantifiable through measures such as concurrence and entanglement entropy, reflecting the strength of the correlation.  Furthermore, the phenomenon underpins various quantum information processing protocols, including quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing, showcasing its significance in the development of novel technologies leveraging the intrinsically quantum nature of information.  Ongoing research continues to explore the fundamental implications of entanglement and its potential for technological advancement.
