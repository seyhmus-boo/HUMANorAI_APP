Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have captivated researchers since their discovery by Iijima in 1991.  This presentation will explore the remarkable properties of these nanomaterials, underpinning their potential for diverse applications.  We will begin with a brief overview of their historical context, highlighting the transition from theoretical predictions to experimental confirmation and subsequent rapid advancements in synthesis and characterization techniques.  The core of the presentation will focus on the exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of CNTs.  Their extraordinary tensile strength and Young's modulus, surpassing those of steel, will be discussed, alongside their unique electrical conductivity, which can be tuned between metallic and semiconducting behavior depending on chirality.  Furthermore, the superior thermal conductivity of CNTs, exceeding that of many metals, will be examined.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon current challenges and ongoing research focusing on scalable production methods, controlling their structural properties, and exploring their integration into practical devices, highlighting their potential to revolutionize various fields from aerospace engineering to biomedical applications.
