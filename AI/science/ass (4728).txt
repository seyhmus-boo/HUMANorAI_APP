Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  Imagine a single sheet of graphite, a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms, rolled into a seamless cylinder; this is the fundamental structure of a CNT.  This seemingly simple construction bestows extraordinary properties.

Firstly, their *high tensile strength*, exceeding that of steel, is analogous to a single strand of incredibly strong spider silk capable of supporting immense weight.  Secondly, their *exceptional electrical conductivity*, comparable to copper, can be likened to a supremely efficient electrical wire, facilitating rapid electron transport.  Furthermore, their *remarkable thermal conductivity*, surpassing many metals, functions like a high-performance heat sink, efficiently dissipating heat.  Finally, their *high aspect ratio*, meaning extreme length-to-diameter proportions, is comparable to incredibly thin and long fibers, offering unique potential for applications in composite materials and nanoelectronics. These unique combinations of properties make CNTs a material of significant technological interest.
