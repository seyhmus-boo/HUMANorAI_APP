The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their unique quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp² hybridized carbon atoms form a seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheet, creating a cylindrical structure with a diameter typically ranging from nanometers to tens of nanometers.  This geometry leads to quantum confinement effects, influencing the electronic properties.  In armchair CNTs, the specific arrangement of carbon atoms results in metallic conductivity, owing to the presence of a continuous band structure across the Fermi level.  Zigzag and chiral CNTs, conversely, can exhibit either semiconducting or metallic behaviour depending on their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet roll-up), determined by the (n,m) indices defining their structure. This chirality-dependent band gap is a direct consequence of the quantized momentum states allowed within the nanotube's confined geometry.  Furthermore, the strong covalent σ-bonds within the hexagonal lattice contribute to their exceptional tensile strength and stiffness, while the delocalized π-electrons facilitate various interactions crucial for applications in electronics and sensing.  Consequently, the electronic and mechanical properties are finely tunable through precise control over the nanotube diameter and chirality.
