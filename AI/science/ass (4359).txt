Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, traditionally relies on general relativity. However, the singularity at the black hole's center necessitates a quantum-gravitational description, highlighting the limitations of classical approaches. This presentation explores the quantum mechanical aspects of black hole formation, focusing on the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory. We will examine the implications of Hawking radiation and its potential to resolve the information paradox, considering its role in the evaporation of black holes and the ultimate fate of information.  Furthermore, we will discuss the challenges of quantizing gravity and the various theoretical frameworks proposed, including loop quantum gravity and string theory, to describe the process of black hole formation from a fundamentally quantum perspective.  We will consider how these approaches address the singularity problem and offer insights into the initial conditions and dynamics leading to black hole collapse. Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the potential observational signatures that may distinguish quantum effects from classical predictions, paving the way for future experimental verification and a more complete understanding of black hole formation.
