DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding stemmed from the seminal work of Watson and Crick (1953), whose double helix model suggested a semi-conservative mechanism â€“ each strand serving as a template for a new complementary strand. This hypothesis was subsequently validated by Meselson and Stahl's (1958) experiment using isotopic labelling.

The process initiates at specific origins of replication, where DNA helicase unwinds the double helix, creating a replication fork.  Single-strand binding proteins prevent re-annealing, while topoisomerases relieve torsional stress.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate elongation.  This polymerase adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to continuous synthesis on the leading strand and discontinuous synthesis on the lagging strand, forming Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA, and DNA ligase seals the resulting nicks.  This intricate, multi-enzyme process ensures high fidelity, aided by proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerase.  The end result is two identical DNA molecules, each consisting of one parental and one newly synthesized strand.
