This presentation provides a concise overview of chemical bonding and molecular structure through the lens of quantum mechanics.  We will explore how the fundamental principles of quantum theory, specifically the Schrödinger equation and its solutions, underpin our understanding of molecular properties.  The presentation will focus on the formation of covalent bonds, highlighting the role of atomic orbitals and their linear combination to form molecular orbitals.  Concepts like bonding and antibonding orbitals, orbital hybridization (e.g., sp, sp², sp³), and their influence on molecular geometry will be discussed.  Furthermore, we will briefly touch upon the application of molecular orbital theory to explain molecular spectroscopy and reactivity.  The presentation will avoid overly complex mathematical formalism, instead emphasizing the conceptual understanding of how quantum mechanics dictates the shapes and properties of molecules.  Examples will be drawn from simple diatomic molecules to illustrate core principles, building a foundation for understanding more complex systems.  Finally, the limitations of commonly used approximations in quantum chemical calculations will be briefly considered.
