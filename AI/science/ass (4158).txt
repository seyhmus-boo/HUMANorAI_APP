Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, is a complex process driven primarily by the strong and Coulomb forces.  This summary focuses on the mechanisms underlying induced fission, predominantly employing neutron-induced reactions.  The process initiates with neutron capture, leading to the formation of a compound nucleus in a highly excited state.  This excited nucleus subsequently undergoes deformation, overcoming the fission barrier through collective nuclear motion.  The precise pathway and timescale depend heavily on the nuclear structure of the fissile isotope, influencing the probability of fission versus other decay modes like gamma emission.  The subsequent scission of the compound nucleus results in two (or more) fission fragments, typically of unequal mass, accompanied by the release of prompt neutrons and gamma rays.  The energy released is a consequence of the mass defect between the initial nucleus and the resulting fragments.  Furthermore, delayed neutrons emitted from the decay of fission products significantly impact reactor control and dynamics.  Further research focuses on understanding the intricate interplay of nuclear structure and dynamics to enhance predictive models of fission product yields and energy release, critical for advanced reactor designs and nuclear waste management.
