Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, are fascinating subjects for quantum mechanical investigation.  Their unique structure, essentially rolled-up graphene sheets, dictates their electronic behavior.  Quantum calculations, primarily employing Density Functional Theory (DFT), reveal that CNTs' electronic properties are highly dependent on their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's roll) and diameter.  Armchair nanotubes exhibit metallic conductivity due to their band structure featuring a zero band gap, while zigzag and chiral nanotubes can be either metallic or semiconducting, displaying a band gap inversely proportional to diameter.

Further quantum mechanical analysis explores electron transport phenomena in CNTs, revealing ballistic transport at low temperatures and the influence of defects and impurities on conductivity.  Studies involving tight-binding approximations provide insights into the  electronic density of states, crucial for understanding their reactivity and potential applications in electronics.  Moreover, quantum simulations offer valuable understanding of CNT's mechanical strength stemming from strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds, and their thermal conductivity, governed by phonon transport.  Despite computational challenges associated with large systems, quantum mechanical approaches remain indispensable in uncovering and explaining the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes.
