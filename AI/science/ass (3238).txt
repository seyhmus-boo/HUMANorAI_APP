Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon predicted by early quantum mechanics and experimentally verified since the mid-20th century, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation persists even when the systems are spatially separated, defying classical notions of locality and realism.  Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen famously articulated paradoxes arising from entanglement, questioning the completeness of quantum mechanics in their 1935 EPR paper.  Bell's inequalities, proposed in the 1960s, provided a testable framework to distinguish between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories.  Subsequent experimental violations of Bell inequalities have decisively confirmed the existence of entanglement, solidifying its role as a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics.  Entanglement forms the basis of emerging quantum technologies, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  Ongoing research continues to explore the fundamental nature of entanglement and its potential for technological advancements, encompassing investigations into high-dimensional entanglement, entanglement distribution over long distances, and the development of robust entanglement-based protocols.
