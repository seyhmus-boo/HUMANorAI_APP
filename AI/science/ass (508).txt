DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating the genome, is fundamental to cell division and heredity.  Initiation involves unwinding the double helix at origins of replication by helicases, stabilized by single-stranded binding proteins.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, which adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to continuous synthesis on the leading strand and discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.  DNA polymerase I removes primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the gaps between Okazaki fragments, resulting in two identical daughter molecules.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and mismatch repair mechanisms.  Errors in replication, however, can lead to mutations, driving evolution but also contributing to disease.  Understanding DNA replication has numerous practical applications.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) exploits this process for DNA amplification in diagnostics and forensics.  Antiviral drugs targeting viral DNA polymerases demonstrate the clinical significance of interfering with replication.  Furthermore, research into replication fidelity informs cancer research, as uncontrolled replication is a hallmark of cancerous cells.  In summary, DNA replication is a highly regulated and crucial process with far-reaching implications for biology and medicine.
