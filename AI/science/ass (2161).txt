Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential across diverse technological applications.  However, realizing this potential is significantly hampered by persistent experimental challenges hindering the reliable synthesis, characterization, and manipulation of these nanoscale materials.  This paper focuses on the key experimental limitations encountered in the comprehensive study of CNT properties.  Challenges associated with achieving high purity and uniformity in CNT synthesis, including the prevalence of structural defects and variations in diameter and chirality, are critically examined.  Furthermore, the intricacies of accurately characterizing the complex structure and properties of individual CNTs, particularly their chirality and the precise measurement of mechanical strength and electrical conductivity, are discussed.  Finally, we address the difficulties involved in manipulating and assembling individual CNTs into macroscopic structures for practical device fabrication, highlighting the limitations imposed by van der Waals interactions and the propensity for bundling. Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for unlocking the full potential of CNTs and for advancing their integration into functional devices and materials.
