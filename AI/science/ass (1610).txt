Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating intersection of plasma physics and quantum mechanics.  While classical plasma physics adequately describes many macroscopic phenomena, a quantum mechanical perspective is crucial for understanding certain behaviours.  Specifically, at high densities or low temperatures, quantum effects become dominant.  The Pauli exclusion principle, for instance, influences electron degeneracy pressure, vital in understanding white dwarf stars and inertial confinement fusion.

Furthermore, quantum mechanical effects significantly impact wave-particle duality within plasmas.  Collective plasma oscillations, such as Langmuir waves, exhibit quantized excitations – plasmons – which are crucial in understanding energy transfer and radiation processes.  Quantum electrodynamic effects, though often negligible in most plasma applications, become important in high-energy density plasmas, influencing processes like bremsstrahlung radiation and photon-plasma interactions.  Understanding these quantum effects is therefore paramount for accurately modelling and predicting the behaviour of plasmas in extreme environments.  We will delve into specific examples in subsequent lectures.
