This presentation offers a concise overview of key plasma physics phenomena, focusing on their fundamental processes and diverse applications. We will begin by examining fundamental plasma properties, including Debye shielding and plasma oscillations, highlighting the collective behavior that distinguishes plasmas from neutral gases.  The presentation will then delve into a selection of significant phenomena:  magnetic confinement and its relevance to fusion energy research,  wave-particle interactions, such as Landau damping and cyclotron resonance,  and the generation and propagation of shocks in space plasmas. The role of instabilities, including drift-wave and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, in driving turbulence and anomalous transport will also be addressed.  Finally, we will briefly explore the burgeoning field of laboratory astrophysics, demonstrating how controlled plasma experiments can provide insights into astrophysical processes, such as stellar flares and supernova remnants. This overview aims to provide a foundational understanding of plasma physics phenomena, emphasizing both their theoretical underpinnings and their practical implications across a range of scientific disciplines.
