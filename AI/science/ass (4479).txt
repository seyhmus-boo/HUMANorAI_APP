Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes.  Recall that fission involves the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and neutrons.  These neutrons then trigger further fissions, leading to a chain reaction, the basis of nuclear reactors and weapons.

Traditional fission reactors utilize thermal neutrons, slowed down by moderators.  However, recent developments emphasize fast neutron reactors, offering advantages such as enhanced neutron economy and the potential to breed fissile material from fertile isotopes like uranium-238, thus extending the lifespan of nuclear fuel.  Furthermore, research into Accelerator Driven Subcritical Systems (ADSS) is gaining momentum.  ADSS utilizes a particle accelerator to induce fission in a subcritical core, providing enhanced control and potentially reducing the accumulation of long-lived radioactive waste.

Ongoing research also explores innovative fuel cycles and advanced reactor designs aiming to improve safety, efficiency, and waste management.  These developments are crucial for addressing global energy demands while mitigating the environmental impact associated with nuclear power.
