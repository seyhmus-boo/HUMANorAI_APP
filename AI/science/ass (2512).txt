Black hole formation, a pivotal process in astrophysical evolution, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stellar cores or through the accretion of matter in galactic nuclei.  Stellar-mass black holes (BHs), typically ranging from a few to tens of solar masses, result from the final stages of massive star evolution.  Core collapse, triggered by the cessation of nuclear fusion, overcomes electron degeneracy pressure, leading to an inexorable implosion and the formation of a singularity shrouded by an event horizon.  The specifics of this process, including the role of jets and supernova explosions, remain active areas of research, particularly concerning the mass-gap problem between observed stellar and supermassive BHs.  Supermassive BHs, inhabiting galactic centers, present a distinct formation mechanism.  While direct collapse scenarios are proposed for early universe formation, hierarchical merging of smaller BHs through dynamical friction and mergers in dense stellar environments is currently favored as the primary growth mechanism, although the initial "seeds" for this process remain a subject of ongoing investigation and debate.  Further advancements in gravitational wave astronomy and multi-wavelength observational techniques are crucial for deepening our understanding of BH formation across the observed mass spectrum.
