Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional material properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices.  Their remarkable properties arise from this structure and strong carbon-carbon bonds.  CNTs exist in two primary forms: single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), each with distinct characteristics.

Mechanically, CNTs possess exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, surpassing steel by orders of magnitude.  This strength, coupled with their low density, makes them ideal for reinforcement in composite materials.  Electrically, SWNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality (the helical arrangement of carbon atoms), offering potential for nanoelectronics.  MWNTs generally exhibit metallic conductivity.  Thermally, CNTs exhibit high thermal conductivity along their axial direction, making them suitable for thermal management applications.  Furthermore, their large surface area contributes to significant adsorption capabilities, useful in areas like gas storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in scalable production and controlled synthesis of specific CNT types with desired properties.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these limitations to fully exploit their potential across diverse technological domains.
