Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, has underpinned life on Earth for billions of years.  Early understanding, dating back to the 17th century with Jan van Helmont's experiments on willow trees, incorrectly attributed plant growth solely to water uptake.  The pivotal discovery of oxygen release during photosynthesis by Jan Ingenhousz in the 18th century marked a significant advancement.

The 20th century witnessed the elucidation of the intricate mechanisms.  Two interconnected photosystems, PSI and PSII, operate in series within thylakoid membranes.  PSII utilizes light energy to split water molecules (photolysis), releasing oxygen and generating high-energy electrons.  These electrons travel down an electron transport chain, driving proton pumping and ATP synthesis (photophosphorylation).  PSI then uses light energy to further boost electron energy, ultimately reducing NADP+ to NADPH.  Both ATP and NADPH, high-energy molecules, power the Calvin cycle, where CO2 is fixed and reduced into carbohydrates.  Variations exist, including C4 and CAM pathways, adaptations to optimize carbon fixation in arid or high-light conditions. This intricate interplay of light-dependent and light-independent reactions sustains the biosphere's primary productivity.
