Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a source of ongoing investigation. This presentation will provide a concise overview of entanglement, tracing its historical roots from Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen's (EPR) paradox in 1935, which highlighted the seemingly paradoxical nature of quantum non-locality.  The EPR paper challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics, arguing that entanglement implied the existence of hidden variables.  However, Bell's theorem, formulated in the 1960s, provided a framework for experimentally testing the validity of local realism versus quantum mechanical predictions.  Subsequent experimental violations of Bell inequalities have decisively confirmed the reality of entanglement, showcasing the profound departure from classical intuitions.  The presentation will then briefly explore contemporary applications of entanglement, including its crucial role in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation, highlighting its potential for transformative technologies.  Finally, open challenges and future research directions in understanding and controlling entanglement will be addressed.
