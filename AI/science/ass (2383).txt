Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a fertile ground for technological advancements. This presentation will provide a concise overview of entanglement, tracing its historical roots from Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen's (EPR) paradox, which initially highlighted its counter-intuitive nature and challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics.  The EPR paper, published in 1935, questioned the concept of "spooky action at a distance" inherent in entangled systems.  Subsequent experimental verification of Bell's inequalities, however, definitively demonstrated the reality of entanglement and its violation of classical correlations.  This presentation will then explore the fundamental principles underlying entanglement, including the concept of superposition and the crucial role of measurement in collapsing entangled states.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the burgeoning field of quantum technologies leveraging entanglement, highlighting its potential applications in quantum computing, cryptography, and quantum sensing. This overview will aim to provide a foundational understanding of this fascinating and impactful quantum phenomenon.
