Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating phenomenon of black hole formation.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, exceeding approximately three times the mass of our Sun.  As a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses under its own immense gravity.  If the core's mass surpasses the Chandrasekhar limit, electron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to counteract further collapse, leading to an infinitely dense singularity.  This singularity warps spacetime, creating the black hole's event horizon, a point of no return beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, form via mechanisms still under investigation, possibly involving the accretion of vast quantities of matter or the merger of smaller black holes.

While the direct observation of black holes is challenging, their gravitational effects on nearby stars and gas offer indirect evidence. Studying black hole formation provides crucial insights into stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. Practically, this knowledge informs our understanding of gravitational wave astronomy – the ripples in spacetime detected from merging black holes – and offers potential avenues for future energy technologies, albeit highly speculative at present.
