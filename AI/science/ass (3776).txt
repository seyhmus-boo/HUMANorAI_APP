Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized carbon structure.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to remarkable tensile strength, significantly exceeding that of steel, while their low density offers advantageous weight-to-strength ratios.  Electrical conductivity varies dramatically depending on chirality; armchair CNTs are metallic, while zigzag and chiral CNTs can be semiconducting, offering potential for nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, their thermal conductivity is exceptionally high, making them promising for thermal management applications.

Recent developments focus on controlled synthesis to achieve specific chiralities and diameters, crucial for tailoring their electronic and mechanical properties.  Advances in functionalization techniques allow for precise modification of CNT surfaces, enhancing dispersibility in various matrices and enabling integration into composite materials.  Research also explores the potential of CNTs in energy storage, with studies demonstrating their effectiveness in lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors.  However, challenges remain in scalable production of high-quality CNTs and addressing potential toxicity concerns for widespread application.
