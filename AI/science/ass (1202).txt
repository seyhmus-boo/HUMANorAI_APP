Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic chemistry, enabling efficient and selective transformations otherwise inaccessible.  However, their implementation presents several significant experimental challenges. This presentation will focus on key difficulties encountered in catalyst design, synthesis, and application. We will discuss issues related to catalyst stability, including decomposition pathways under reaction conditions and the impact of solvent and temperature.  The inherent heterogeneity of many catalytic systems, leading to difficulties in characterizing active species and quantifying catalyst loading, will be addressed.  Furthermore, the often-subtle interplay between catalyst structure and reactivity will be highlighted, emphasizing the challenges in optimizing catalyst performance through rational design and high-throughput screening.  We will also explore the complexities of catalyst recovery and reuse, a crucial aspect for sustainability and economic viability.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the increasing importance of in-situ characterization techniques to better understand catalyst behaviour under real reaction conditions and thereby guide future catalyst development.  By examining these experimental hurdles, we aim to stimulate discussion and identify potential avenues for overcoming these limitations.
