Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, has captivated scientists since the theoretical prediction of these enigmatic objects by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916.  This presentation will explore the diverse astrophysical processes leading to black hole creation, tracing their historical understanding from initial theoretical concepts to current observational evidence.  We will examine the two primary pathways: stellar-mass black hole formation through the gravitational collapse of massive stars at the end of their lifecycle, and supermassive black hole formation, a process still shrouded in some mystery, with leading theories involving direct collapse of gas clouds or the merger of numerous stellar-mass black holes.

The presentation will briefly discuss observational techniques employed to identify and study black holes, highlighting the crucial role of gravitational waves detected by LIGO/Virgo, and electromagnetic observations across the spectrum.  Challenges remain, particularly in understanding the detailed physics of the accretion disks surrounding black holes and their influence on galactic evolution. We will conclude by briefly outlining current research frontiers and future directions in the ongoing quest to unravel the complexities of black hole formation and its impact on the Universe's structure and evolution.
