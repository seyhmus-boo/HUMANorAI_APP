Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, sharing a combined fate regardless of spatial separation.  This interconnectedness transcends classical physics; measuring the property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the measurable property of the other, even across vast distances.  Imagine two coins flipped simultaneously, but in a way where one always lands heads and the other tails, no matter how far apart they are. This is analogous to entanglement, albeit a simplified representation.  The coins aren't predetermined; their outcomes are only defined upon measurement.  Similarly, entangled particles don't possess definite properties until measured, and the outcome of measurement on one dictates the outcome on the others.  This "spooky action at a distance," as Einstein termed it, arises from the superposition principle, where particles exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed, and the fundamental interconnectedness described by the wave function encompassing the entangled system. The precise mechanism underpinning instantaneous correlation remains a subject of ongoing investigation and philosophical debate.
