Black hole formation represents a pivotal juncture in stellar evolution and a crucial testing ground for general relativity. This presentation will explore the diverse pathways leading to black hole genesis, focusing on the collapse of massive stars and the potential role of binary interactions. We will examine the critical interplay between stellar mass, rotation rate, and metallicity in determining the ultimate fate of a star, differentiating between the formation of stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  Recent advancements in numerical relativity and observational techniques, including gravitational wave astronomy and multi-messenger observations, are revolutionizing our understanding of these processes.  We will highlight key observational signatures used to identify and characterize black hole candidates, including X-ray emissions from accretion disks and the detection of gravitational waves from merging black hole binaries.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the practical applications stemming from this research, touching upon its implications for fundamental physics (testing gravity in extreme regimes), astrophysical modeling (improving simulations of galactic evolution), and technological advancements (inspiring novel data analysis techniques for complex datasets).  This presentation aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of black hole formation, its observational probes, and its far-reaching impact across multiple scientific disciplines.
