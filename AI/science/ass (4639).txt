Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is a crucial process underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry.  This process typically involves bombarding a fissile isotope, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with a neutron.  The absorption of this neutron destabilizes the nucleus, causing it to undergo fission. This fission event yields lighter daughter nuclei, a varying number of neutrons (typically 2-3), and a significant release of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and gamma radiation.  The released neutrons can then induce further fission events in surrounding fissile material, leading to a chain reaction.  The control of this chain reaction is paramount in nuclear reactors, achieved through the use of neutron moderators and control rods.  The energy released during fission is harnessed through heat exchangers to generate electricity.  However, the uncontrolled nature of a chain reaction is the basis of nuclear weapons, highlighting the duality of this potent process.  The precise nature of the fission products varies depending on the fissile material and the incident neutron energy, making accurate prediction a complex computational undertaking.
