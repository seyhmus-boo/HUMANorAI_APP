Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, irrespective of the spatial separation.  This non-classical correlation implies that the constituent particles' fates are intertwined, exhibiting correlated behaviours even at macroscopic distances.  Crucially, measuring the property of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the other, regardless of separation.

The implications extend far beyond fundamental physics.  In computer science, entanglement forms the basis for quantum computing, promising exponential speedups in computation through quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers.  Furthermore, quantum cryptography utilizes entanglement for secure communication channels, exploiting the inherent unpredictability of quantum measurements to detect eavesdropping.  Interdisciplinary connections also emerge in materials science, where manipulating entanglement could lead to novel materials with tailored properties, impacting areas like superconductivity and quantum sensing technologies.  Finally, foundational questions in philosophy regarding locality and realism are directly challenged by the existence of entanglement, prompting ongoing debate across scientific disciplines.
