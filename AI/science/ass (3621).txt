DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding, stemming from Chargaff's rules on base pairing and the elucidation of the double helix structure by Watson and Crick in 1953, provided the foundational framework for comprehending this intricate process.  The semi-conservative model, proposed by Watson and Crick and subsequently experimentally verified by Meselson and Stahl, established that each daughter DNA molecule retains one parental strand.  This process involves a complex interplay of enzymes, including DNA helicases, which unwind the double helix; DNA polymerases, which synthesize new strands in a 5' to 3' direction; and primases, which synthesize RNA primers.  Leading and lagging strand synthesis, characterized by continuous and discontinuous replication respectively, accommodate the antiparallel nature of the DNA strands.  Telomeres, repetitive sequences at chromosome ends, present a unique challenge to replication, often addressed by telomerase activity.  Errors in replication are minimized by proofreading mechanisms intrinsic to DNA polymerases and subsequent repair pathways.  Ongoing research continues to unravel the intricacies of replication, focusing on the regulation of replication timing, the mechanisms of error correction, and the roles of replication in genome stability and disease.
