Stellar-mass black hole formation is a consequence of the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.  Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel in the stellar core, the core's internal pressure can no longer counteract the inward pull of gravity.  This initiates a catastrophic collapse, resulting in the formation of a singularity at the center.  The subsequent accretion of surrounding stellar material, propelled by strong gravitational forces, forms an accretion disk characterized by significant heating and high-energy radiation emission, often observed as a luminous active galactic nucleus (AGN) in the case of supermassive black holes.  The specific conditions leading to black hole formation, including the star's initial mass, metallicity, and rotation rate, significantly influence the final black hole mass and spin.  Neutron star mergers are another significant pathway for black hole creation, albeit less common than stellar collapse.  These mergers, involving two neutron stars spiraling inward due to gravitational radiation, ultimately result in a black hole if the combined mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.  Further research is crucial to refine our understanding of the diverse processes contributing to black hole formation across a wide range of masses and environments.
