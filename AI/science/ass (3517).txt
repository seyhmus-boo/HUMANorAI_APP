Quantum entanglement describes a peculiar correlation between two or more quantum systems.  Unlike classical correlations, entanglement transcends spatial separation.  Imagine two coins, flipped simultaneously but hidden in separate boxes.  Knowing one is heads implies the other is tails (classical correlation).  Entanglement, however, is like having two magical coins:  before observation, neither possesses a definite heads-or-tails state.  Only upon measuring one coin – say, finding it heads – does the other *instantaneously* assume the opposite state, regardless of the distance separating them.  This instantaneous correlation defies classical physics, where information transmission is limited by the speed of light.

The entangled systems are described by a single, unified quantum state, not as independent entities with individual states.  This is analogous to two dancers perfectly synchronised in a complex routine:  describing one dancer's movement independently is insufficient; their intertwined choreography defines their combined state.  The act of measurement "collapses" this unified wavefunction, forcing each system into a definite state, while maintaining the correlation.  The mechanism underpinning this instantaneous correlation remains a subject of ongoing debate and investigation, with implications for quantum computing and communication.
