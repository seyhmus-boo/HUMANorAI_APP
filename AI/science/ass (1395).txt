Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, presents significant experimental challenges despite its theoretical elegance. This presentation will explore the key hurdles encountered in the creation, manipulation, and verification of entangled states, particularly focusing on the fragility of entanglement to environmental noise.  We will discuss the impact of decoherence, stemming from interactions with the surrounding environment, which rapidly destroys entanglement and limits the scalability of quantum technologies.  Specific experimental challenges include achieving high fidelity entanglement generation, maintaining long coherence times, and implementing efficient and robust entanglement verification protocols.  The presentation will highlight recent advances in overcoming these challenges, such as the use of advanced materials with reduced decoherence rates, sophisticated quantum error correction techniques, and improved measurement strategies.  Finally, we will discuss the ongoing quest for scalable and robust entanglement generation and manipulation, crucial for realizing the full potential of quantum computation, communication, and sensing.  The limitations and future directions in this vibrant field will be addressed.
