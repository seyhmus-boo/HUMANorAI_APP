Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional structural and electronic properties, have garnered significant attention for diverse applications.  Their unique cylindrical structure, comprising spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices, results in exceptionally high tensile strength, Young's modulus, and thermal conductivity.  Recent advancements focus on controlling CNT synthesis to achieve precise chirality and diameter distributions, crucial for tailoring their electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior.  This precise control enables the fabrication of high-performance transistors, sensors, and transparent conductive films.  Furthermore, significant progress has been made in developing scalable and cost-effective production methods, including chemical vapor deposition and floating catalyst techniques.  Research on functionalization strategies, such as covalent and non-covalent modification, enhances CNT dispersibility and allows for integration into composite materials, improving mechanical reinforcement and electrical conductivity.  Ongoing research explores the utilization of CNTs in advanced energy storage devices, biomedical applications, and next-generation electronics, promising breakthroughs in diverse technological fields.  However, challenges remain in addressing toxicological concerns and improving long-term stability for widespread practical implementation.
