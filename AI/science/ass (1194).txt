DNA replication, the process by which a cell creates an identical copy of its DNA, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding, predating Watson and Crick's 1953 model, stemmed from experiments demonstrating semi-conservative replication â€“ each new DNA molecule consists of one parental and one newly synthesized strand.  Meselson and Stahl's elegant density gradient centrifugation experiment definitively proved this model in 1958.

The process itself is complex and highly regulated.  Initiation involves unwinding the double helix at specific origins of replication by helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-strand binding proteins prevent re-annealing, while topoisomerases relieve torsional stress.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate DNA synthesis, working continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, generating Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I then removes primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the gaps between Okazaki fragments, ensuring genomic integrity.  Proofreading mechanisms, primarily inherent to DNA polymerases, minimize errors during replication, though occasional mutations remain. The fidelity and speed of this process are remarkable, ensuring accurate transmission of genetic information across generations.
