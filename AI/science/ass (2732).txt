Black hole formation remains a vibrant area of astrophysical research, with recent advancements refining our understanding of this fundamental process.  This presentation will summarise the primary pathways to black hole formation: stellar collapse and galactic mergers.  Regarding stellar collapse, we will discuss the ongoing refinement of stellar evolution models, particularly concerning the role of rotation and magnetic fields in determining the final fate of massive stars.  Recent high-resolution simulations are shedding light on the complex interplay of these factors, impacting the predicted black hole mass distribution and spin.

Furthermore, we will examine the growing body of evidence supporting the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) via direct collapse of gas clouds in the early universe, bypassing the traditional stellar-mass black hole growth pathway.  Recent observations of high-redshift quasars challenge existing models, necessitating consideration of novel mechanisms like enhanced accretion and rapid mergers in dense environments.  We will also briefly touch upon the detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes, providing crucial empirical constraints on their masses and spins, enriching our understanding of their evolutionary history. Finally, the presentation will highlight outstanding questions and future research directions, emphasizing the crucial interplay between theoretical modeling, observational astronomy, and gravitational wave detection in unraveling the mysteries of black hole formation.
