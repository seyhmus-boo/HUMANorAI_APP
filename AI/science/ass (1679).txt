DNA replication, the precise duplication of the genome, is fundamental to life.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of the core mechanisms of DNA replication, focusing on the interplay between key enzymes such as DNA polymerases, helicases, and primases.  We will highlight the intricate choreography of leading and lagging strand synthesis, including the challenges posed by replication forks encountering obstacles like DNA lesions or repetitive sequences.

Recent advancements have significantly refined our understanding of this process.  Advances in single-molecule techniques, such as nanopore sequencing and high-speed atomic force microscopy, now allow real-time visualization of replication dynamics at unprecedented resolution.  These studies are revealing novel details about the spatiotemporal organization of replication factories and the regulation of replication origin firing.  Furthermore, research into the roles of accessory proteins and post-translational modifications in replication fidelity and control is providing crucial insights into the prevention of replication errors and genome instability.  We will discuss these emerging findings, particularly their implications for understanding the etiology of genetic diseases and cancer, and their potential for therapeutic intervention.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the ongoing exploration of novel replication mechanisms in diverse organisms, expanding our understanding of the evolutionary plasticity of this essential process.
