Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, have spurred extensive research due to their potential applications in diverse fields.  Their remarkable tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, coupled with high flexibility and low density, makes them attractive for advanced composite materials.  Recent advancements focus on precisely controlling CNT synthesis, achieving high purity and monodispersity via techniques like chemical vapor deposition with improved catalyst design.  Electrical properties, including tunable conductivity ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, are being exploited in next-generation electronics, with progress made in fabricating high-performance transistors and transparent conductive films.  Furthermore, recent studies explore CNTs' thermal conductivity for thermal management applications, demonstrating their potential in heat dissipation for electronics and energy storage devices.  Challenges remain in scaling up production cost-effectively and addressing issues like aggregation and dispersion for practical applications.  However, ongoing research addressing these limitations promises to unlock the full potential of CNTs in a wide range of technological domains.
