Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, remains a significant challenge at the interface of general relativity and quantum mechanics.  Classical gravitational collapse predicts the formation of a singularity, a region of infinite density, violating fundamental principles of quantum mechanics.  This necessitates a quantum-gravitational description of the process.  Several approaches attempt to address this, including loop quantum gravity which proposes a discrete spacetime structure preventing singularity formation and suggesting a "bounce" instead of collapse.  String theory offers another perspective, where black holes are described as extended objects with finite entropy, potentially resolving the information paradox.  Semiclassical approaches, incorporating quantum fields in a curved spacetime background, explore Hawking radiation and its implications for black hole evaporation and information loss.  However, a complete, consistent quantum theory of black hole formation requires a unified theory of quantum gravity, capable of addressing the profound interplay between spacetime geometry and quantum fluctuations near the Planck scale.  Ongoing research in these areas aims to elucidate the fundamental processes governing black hole formation and unveil the quantum nature of spacetime itself.
