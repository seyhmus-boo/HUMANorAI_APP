Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally explained through quantum mechanics, specifically the Schrödinger equation.  This equation describes the behavior of electrons within a molecule, whose solutions yield molecular orbitals (MOs).  The formation of chemical bonds arises from the constructive interference of atomic orbitals, leading to lower-energy bonding MOs that are spatially localized between nuclei.  Conversely, destructive interference results in higher-energy antibonding MOs.

The electron configuration within these MOs determines the bond order and thus the bond strength and length.  Molecular geometries are dictated by the Pauli exclusion principle and Hund's rule, which govern electron occupancy in MOs, alongside minimizing electron-electron and electron-nuclear repulsions.  Advanced computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and Hartree-Fock calculations, provide approximate solutions to the Schrödinger equation for complex molecules, allowing for the prediction of molecular structures and properties like dipole moments and vibrational frequencies.  These methods underpin our understanding of reaction mechanisms and reactivity, bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.
