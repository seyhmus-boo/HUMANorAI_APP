The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting such extreme gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a fascinating area of astrophysics with roots in 18th-century Newtonian physics.  Early conceptualisations, however, lacked the rigorous framework provided by Einstein's General Relativity in the early 20th century.  General Relativity predicted the existence of black holes as a consequence of gravitational collapse, a process where a sufficiently massive star, at the end of its life cycle, exhausts its nuclear fuel and implodes under its own gravity.

Crucially, the mass of the progenitor star is paramount. Stars less massive than approximately three solar masses will ultimately become white dwarfs or neutron stars. However, those exceeding this limit, often termed "supermassive stars," undergo catastrophic collapse, their matter compressed into a singularity of infinite density.  The event horizon, a boundary beyond which escape is impossible, defines the black hole's extent.  While direct observation of black holes remains challenging, observational evidence such as gravitational lensing and the detection of gravitational waves strongly supports their existence and the validity of the gravitational collapse model.  Furthermore, supermassive black holes residing at galactic centres pose further intriguing questions regarding their formation mechanisms and the evolution of galaxies.
