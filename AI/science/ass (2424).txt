Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient tool for genome editing.  This technology, adapted from a bacterial defense mechanism, leverages guided RNA molecules to direct the Cas nuclease to specific DNA sequences, enabling targeted gene disruption, insertion, or replacement.  Recent advancements have significantly broadened CRISPR's applications and addressed initial limitations.  Base editing, for instance, allows for precise single-base modifications without causing double-strand breaks, minimizing off-target effects.  Prime editing, a further refinement, expands the range of possible edits by enabling all 12 types of point mutations and small insertions or deletions.  Beyond these improvements in precision, the development of novel Cas enzymes with altered specificity and activity profiles, such as CasX and Cas12, has expanded the targetable genomes and delivery methods.  Furthermore, research continues to explore the therapeutic potential of CRISPR, with ongoing clinical trials evaluating its efficacy in treating genetic disorders such as sickle cell disease and beta-thalassemia. This paper will review these recent developments in CRISPR technology, focusing on their impact on precision, efficacy, and accessibility, and discussing the ongoing challenges and ethical considerations associated with its widespread application.
