Quantum entanglement describes a peculiar correlation between two or more quantum systems, irrespective of the spatial separation between them.  Imagine two coins flipped simultaneously, but in a way that guarantees they always land on opposite sides â€“ heads and tails. This is analogous to entanglement, where the properties of the entangled particles are intrinsically linked.  However, unlike classical correlated systems, the outcome for each individual coin (particle) remains undetermined until measured.  The act of measuring one coin instantaneously determines the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them.

This "spooky action at a distance," as Einstein termed it, defies classical intuition.  It's not about information travelling faster than light; rather, the entangled particles exist in a superposition of states, a probabilistic blend of possibilities, until measurement forces them into a definite state.  Think of it as a single, holistic system encompassing both particles, where the information about their correlated properties is not localized to either but distributed across the entire entangled system. This interconnectedness, defying classical locality, is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics and forms the basis for emerging technologies in quantum computing and communication.
