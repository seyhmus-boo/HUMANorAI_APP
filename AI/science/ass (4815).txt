Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have spurred significant interest in their practical applications.  Their extraordinary tensile strength, exceeding that of steel at a fraction of the weight, coupled with high elasticity, makes them attractive for reinforcement in composite materials, enhancing structural integrity in aerospace and automotive industries.  Depending on chirality, CNTs can behave as metallic or semiconducting materials, offering potential for high-performance transistors and integrated circuits with superior electron mobility.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation in electronics, addressing thermal management challenges.  Furthermore, their large surface area makes them promising candidates for energy storage applications, including high-capacity supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries.  However, challenges remain in large-scale, cost-effective production and controlled functionalization to facilitate integration into diverse systems.  Ongoing research focuses on addressing these issues, paving the way for widespread utilization of CNTs in advanced technologies across multiple sectors.
