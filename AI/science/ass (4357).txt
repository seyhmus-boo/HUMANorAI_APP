Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, present significant challenges for experimental characterization.  Their high aspect ratio and propensity for aggregation hinder accurate determination of intrinsic properties.  Precise measurement of mechanical strength, for instance, is complicated by the difficulty in isolating individual nanotubes and preventing defects which drastically reduce tensile strength.  Similarly,  electrical conductivity measurements are affected by contact resistance between the CNT and electrodes, as well as variations in chirality and structural defects, leading to a wide range of reported values.  Thermal conductivity measurements are further complicated by phonon scattering at nanotube junctions and interfaces with the substrate.  Furthermore,  the precise control over CNT synthesis, particularly achieving high purity and uniformity in terms of diameter, length, and chirality, remains a major obstacle for reproducible experimental results.  These challenges underscore the need for continued development of advanced characterization techniques, such as in-situ microscopy and novel electrode designs, to fully unlock the potential of CNTs.
