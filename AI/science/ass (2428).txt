The formation of black holes, while classically understood through gravitational collapse, finds a deeper, more nuanced explanation within the framework of quantum mechanics.  The crucial element is the interplay between gravity's immense attractive force and the uncertainty principle.  Consider a collapsing stellar core exceeding the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.  Classical physics predicts a singularity, a point of infinite density.  However, quantum mechanically, the uncertainty principle prevents a complete collapse to a point.  Instead, we expect quantum gravitational effects to become dominant at the Planck scale,  where the uncertainty in position and momentum become comparable to the scale of spacetime itself.  

The nature of this quantum state remains a subject of intense research.  Hypotheses include the formation of a Planck-scale "firewall" or a fuzzier horizon defying the classical singularity.  Ultimately, a full quantum theory of gravity, such as loop quantum gravity or string theory, is necessary to accurately model the quantum mechanics of black hole formation and the nature of the singularity itself, potentially resolving the information paradox and other classical inconsistencies.
