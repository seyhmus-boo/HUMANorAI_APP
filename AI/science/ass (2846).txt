Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique sp² hybridized carbon structure.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel at a significantly lower density, is rooted in the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheet that forms the nanotube wall.  This mechanical robustness finds application in materials science, enhancing the tensile strength of composites.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate remarkable electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality – the arrangement of carbon atoms in the hexagonal lattice. This tunable conductivity is exploited in electronics, potentially enabling faster and more energy-efficient transistors.  Their high aspect ratio facilitates their use in sensors, where their large surface area allows for increased sensitivity to analyte adsorption.  Finally, their unique optical properties, including strong absorbance and fluorescence, are being investigated in biomedical imaging and photothermal therapy, illustrating the interdisciplinary reach of CNT research spanning materials science, electronics, chemistry, and biology.  The diverse functionalities of CNTs are thus driven by the fundamental properties of their atomic structure and its consequent macroscopic manifestations.
