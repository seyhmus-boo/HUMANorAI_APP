Nuclear fission is the process whereby a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  This process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the nucleus to become unstable and undergo fission.  The released neutrons can then induce further fission events in a chain reaction, provided a critical mass of fissile material is present.  This chain reaction is the basis for nuclear power generation.

The energy released during fission is a consequence of the mass defect, where the total mass of the fission products is slightly less than the mass of the original nucleus.  This mass difference is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  The high energy released makes fission a powerful source of energy for both peaceful and military applications.

Practically, controlled fission chain reactions are employed in nuclear power plants to generate electricity.  Uncontrolled chain reactions, as seen in nuclear weapons, release vast amounts of energy in a short time, resulting in a devastating explosion.  The radioactive byproducts of fission require careful management and storage due to their long-term radioactivity and potential environmental impact.
