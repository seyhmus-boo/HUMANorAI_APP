Catalysts profoundly influence the reaction pathways of organic chemistry, accelerating rates and altering selectivities by lowering activation energies.  A quantum mechanical perspective elucidates this influence through the examination of frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs). Catalysts, by interacting with reactants, modify the energies and shapes of these FMOs, facilitating bond formation and breakage.  This often involves the catalyst's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) interacting with the reactant's lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), or vice versa, leading to a more favorable orbital overlap and reduced activation energy.

Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations are crucial in computationally investigating catalyst-substrate interactions.  These methods provide insights into charge distribution, bond lengths, and activation barriers, enabling the prediction and rational design of novel catalysts.  Transition state theory, often employed in conjunction with DFT, identifies the energy maximum along the reaction coordinate, offering a quantitative understanding of the catalytic rate enhancement.  Furthermore, the electronic structure modifications induced by catalysts can dictate reaction stereoselectivity, a key area where quantum mechanics provides valuable interpretative power, enabling the understanding of enantioselective catalysis.
