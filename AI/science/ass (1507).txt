Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition.  Its theoretical roots lie in the 1935 Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, which challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics by highlighting the seemingly paradoxical correlations between entangled particles.  These particles, having interacted previously, exhibit correlated properties even when spatially separated.

Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property on the other, regardless of the distance separating them.  This does *not* allow for faster-than-light communication, a crucial clarification.  The correlation arises from the particles' shared quantum state, a superposition until measurement collapses it.  Experimental verification of Bell's inequalities, which tested the predictions of quantum mechanics against those of local realism, unequivocally demonstrated the existence of entanglement.  This counter-intuitive phenomenon is now a cornerstone of quantum information science, forming the basis for emerging technologies such as quantum computing and cryptography.
