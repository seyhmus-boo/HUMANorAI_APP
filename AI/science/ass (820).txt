Chemical bonding and molecular structure constitute a cornerstone of modern chemistry, explaining the diverse properties of matter through the interactions of atoms.  Early understanding, rooted in Dalton's atomic theory (early 19th century), lacked a mechanism for atomic cohesion.  The advent of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century revolutionized the field, providing the theoretical framework for describing bonding through electron orbitals.  Lewis's octet rule, while having limitations, provided a foundational model for covalent bonding based on electron sharing, alongside the contrasting ionic bonding paradigm explained by electrostatic attraction between ions.  

Subsequent developments incorporated concepts such as valence bond theory, which describes bonds as localized electron pairs arising from orbital overlap, and molecular orbital theory, offering a delocalized picture of bonding electrons across the entire molecule.  These theories, complemented by advancements in spectroscopic techniques like X-ray diffraction, allow for the prediction and elucidation of molecular geometries, impacting fields from materials science to drug design.  The relationship between bonding, structure, and macroscopic properties remains a central theme of ongoing chemical research.
