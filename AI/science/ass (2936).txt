Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for diverse technological applications.  However, realizing this potential is significantly hampered by experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains a major hurdle, with significant variations in diameter, chirality, and structural defects commonly observed.  This inherent heterogeneity complicates characterization and limits reproducibility across different studies.  Furthermore, isolating and purifying individual CNTs or specific types from the often-complex as-synthesized mixtures proves challenging, impacting the accuracy of property measurements.  Accurate determination of individual CNT properties, particularly mechanical strength and electrical conductivity, is further complicated by difficulties in achieving reliable sample manipulation and avoiding damage during testing.  Finally, the tendency of CNTs to agglomerate due to strong van der Waals forces presents significant obstacles to processing and integration into devices, limiting scalability and impacting performance.  Addressing these experimental limitations is crucial for advancing CNT-based technologies.
