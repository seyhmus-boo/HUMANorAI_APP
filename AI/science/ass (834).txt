Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties. This review examines the fundamental characteristics of CNTs, focusing on their structure-property relationships.  We analyze the impact of chirality and diameter on their electronic behavior, ranging from metallic to semiconducting, and discuss the implications for applications in nanoelectronics.  The remarkable mechanical strength and stiffness of CNTs, stemming from their spÂ²-hybridized carbon network, are explored, along with their potential for reinforcing composite materials.  Furthermore, the high thermal conductivity of CNTs, attributed to their unique phonon transport mechanisms, is investigated, highlighting their applications in thermal management systems. This review also addresses challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and functionalization, emphasizing the importance of controlled growth parameters and surface modification techniques for achieving desired properties and enabling their integration into diverse technological platforms.  Finally, we outline future research directions and potential breakthroughs in harnessing the full potential of CNTs across a range of applications.
