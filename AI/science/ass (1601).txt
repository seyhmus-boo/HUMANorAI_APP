Black hole formation constitutes a pivotal area in astrophysics, primarily stemming from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses under its own gravity.  For stars exceeding a critical mass (approximately three times the mass of our Sun), this collapse is unstoppable, leading to the formation of a singularity – a point of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

Recent developments refine our understanding of this process.  Numerical simulations, leveraging increased computational power,  provide higher-resolution models of core-collapse supernovae, revealing intricate details of the collapse dynamics and the ensuing jet formation, crucial for the black hole's eventual spin.  Observations through gravitational wave astronomy, following the detection of merging black holes, offer direct evidence of black hole binary systems, and constrain their formation mechanisms – potentially involving isolated binary star evolution or dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments.  Furthermore, advancements in understanding the equation of state of extremely dense matter improve the accuracy of theoretical models, resolving ambiguities in the final collapse phase and black hole properties. These combined approaches continuously refine our comprehension of black hole genesis and their cosmological implications.
