Catalysts in organic chemistry significantly lower activation energies of reactions, accelerating reaction rates without being consumed themselves.  From a quantum mechanical perspective, this effect arises from the alteration of the reaction's potential energy surface (PES). Catalysts achieve this by interacting with reactants, forming transient intermediates with lower-energy transition states compared to the uncatalyzed pathway.  This interaction typically involves orbital overlap between the catalyst and reactant molecules, resulting in a redistribution of electron density.

Specifically, catalysts can stabilize the transition state through several mechanisms:  They may provide alternative reaction pathways with lower activation barriers by offering electron-rich or electron-deficient sites for bond formation or breaking.  Furthermore, catalysts can facilitate charge separation or polarization in the transition state, thus lowering its energy. The lowering of the activation energy is directly reflected in the rate constant, k,  as dictated by the Arrhenius equation, with a lower Ea leading to a significantly larger k.  Thus, the catalytic effect is a direct consequence of manipulating the quantum mechanical properties of the reactants and the transition state.
