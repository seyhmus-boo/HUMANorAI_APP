This review summarizes the fundamental principles of chemical bonding and molecular structure, encompassing both theoretical frameworks and practical applications.  The discussion begins with a concise overview of the various types of chemical bonds, including ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding, emphasizing the role of electronegativity and electron configuration in determining bond type and polarity.  Key theoretical models, such as Valence Bond Theory (VBT) and Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT), are critically compared, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations in predicting molecular geometries and properties.  The impact of molecular structure on physical and chemical properties, including boiling point, reactivity, and spectroscopy, is examined.  Furthermore, the review touches upon advanced concepts such as resonance, hybridization, and intermolecular forces, demonstrating their significance in understanding the behaviour of molecules. Finally, applications of these principles in diverse fields such as materials science, drug design, and catalysis are briefly addressed.  The review concludes by emphasizing the continued importance of research in chemical bonding and molecular structure for advancing our understanding of chemical systems.
