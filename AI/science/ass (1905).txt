Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Its historical roots lie in the theoretical work of physicists like Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, culminating in the experimental observation of uranium fission by Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938. This groundbreaking discovery, subsequently interpreted by Meitner and Otto Frisch, revealed the immense energy release inherent in the process, stemming from the mass defect explained by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.

Fission is primarily induced by neutron bombardment, with isotopes like Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239 exhibiting high fissile potential.  The process generates not only lighter nuclei but also further neutrons, facilitating chain reactions crucial for nuclear reactors and weapons.  Different fission pathways exist, leading to a spectrum of fission products, many of which are radioactive, posing significant challenges in terms of waste management.  Control over the chain reaction is paramount; in reactors, this is achieved through neutron moderators and control rods, while in weapons, uncontrolled exponential growth is exploited.  Understanding the intricacies of fission pathways and neutron interactions remains essential for advancing reactor technology and nuclear safety.
