Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on catalysts in organic chemistry.  Imagine a mountain pass:  a reaction, without a catalyst, requires traversing the highest peak, demanding significant energy.  This energy barrier, known as the activation energy, determines the reaction rate.  A catalyst, however, is like building a tunnel through that mountain.  It provides an alternative pathway with a lower activation energy, significantly accelerating the reaction without being consumed itself.

In essence, catalysts work by forming transient intermediates with the reactants, stabilizing the transition state and thus lowering the energy required for the reaction to proceed.  Think of a matchmaker facilitating a connection between two individuals who might otherwise never meet. The matchmaker (catalyst) is not part of the eventual couple (products), but crucial to their formation.

Different catalysts possess varying degrees of selectivity, akin to a skilled surgeon using specific instruments for a precise operation.  A highly selective catalyst will favour the formation of a specific product, much like a skilled craftsman shaping a material to exact specifications.  Understanding catalyst function is therefore paramount in synthetic organic chemistry for achieving desired reaction outcomes efficiently and selectively.
