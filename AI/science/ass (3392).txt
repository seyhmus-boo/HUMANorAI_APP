DNA replication, the semiconservative process by which a double-stranded DNA molecule produces two identical copies of itself, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding of DNA structure, pioneered by Watson and Crick in 1953, immediately suggested a mechanism for replication, albeit a speculative one.  Their model, based on complementary base pairing, posited that each strand could serve as a template for the synthesis of a new, complementary strand.  This hypothesis was subsequently validated experimentally by Meselson and Stahl's elegant 1958 experiment utilizing density gradient centrifugation, definitively demonstrating the semiconservative nature of replication.  The process itself involves a complex interplay of enzymes, including DNA helicase, which unwinds the double helix; DNA polymerase, responsible for adding nucleotides to the growing strand; and DNA ligase, which joins Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.  The precise coordination of these enzymes, along with various accessory proteins, ensures high fidelity replication, minimizing errors and maintaining the integrity of the genetic code across generations.  Further research continues to elucidate the intricacies of this crucial biological process, including its regulation and the mechanisms for error correction.
