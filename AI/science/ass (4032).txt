Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a unique class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure.  These cylindrical structures, categorized as single-walled (SWCNTs) or multi-walled (MWCNTs), exhibit remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile moduli exceeding that of steel, and exceptional flexibility.  Their electrical conductivity ranges from metallic to semiconducting, depending on chirality and diameter, offering potential for diverse electronic applications.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper, making them attractive for thermal management systems.  Significant research has focused on understanding and manipulating these properties.  Methods for controlled synthesis, including chemical vapor deposition and arc discharge, have been refined to produce CNTs with specific structural parameters.  However, challenges remain in achieving large-scale, cost-effective production and resolving issues related to dispersion and functionalization for practical applications.  Ongoing research is exploring their potential in fields spanning electronics, composites, energy storage, and biomedicine.
