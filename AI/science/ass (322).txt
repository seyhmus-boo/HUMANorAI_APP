Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that hold immense potential for diverse technological applications.  This presentation will explore the key characteristics of CNTs, including their extraordinary tensile strength, high Young's modulus, and remarkable electrical conductivity, which can vary depending on chirality and diameter.  We will discuss their unique thermal properties, characterized by high thermal conductivity along the nanotube axis and lower conductivity perpendicular to it.  The presentation will also delve into the challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and functionalization, crucial for controlling their properties and facilitating integration into devices.

Practical applications arising from these exceptional properties will be highlighted.  Examples include their use as reinforcement materials in composites for enhanced strength and lightweighting in aerospace and automotive industries, their application in high-performance electronics such as transistors and interconnects, and their potential in energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors.  Further, the unique thermal properties of CNTs are being explored for thermal management applications, including heat sinks and advanced cooling systems.  Finally, the presentation will briefly outline emerging research areas and future prospects of CNT-based technologies.
