Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized structure.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility and low density, makes them attractive for advanced composite materials.  Depending on chirality, CNTs can behave as metallic or semiconducting materials, offering potential for applications in high-performance electronics, including transistors and interconnects.  High thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, beneficial for thermal management in electronics and energy applications.  Furthermore, their large surface area contributes to their efficacy as adsorbents and catalysts.  Practical applications currently under development include strengthening lightweight structural components in aerospace and automotive industries,  improving battery performance through enhanced charge/discharge rates, and developing next-generation sensors and actuators.  However, challenges remain in scalable, cost-effective production and controlled dispersion to fully realize the potential of CNTs across diverse fields.
