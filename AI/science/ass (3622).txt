Black hole formation represents a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, bridging theoretical predictions with observational confirmations.  This presentation will trace the historical evolution of our understanding of black hole formation, beginning with the theoretical groundwork laid by Schwarzschild and Oppenheimer-Snyder in the early 20th century, which predicted the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  We will then explore the observational evidence supporting this theory, focusing on the detection of stellar-mass black holes through X-ray binaries and gravitational wave observations from binary black hole mergers by LIGO/Virgo.

The presentation will further discuss the different pathways to black hole formation, contrasting the collapse of massive stars with the potential formation of intermediate-mass and supermassive black holes.  The challenges involved in modeling the complex processes of stellar evolution and subsequent collapse, including the role of rotation and magnetic fields, will be highlighted.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon ongoing research concerning the formation of supermassive black holes in the early universe, emphasizing the need for further observational and theoretical advancements to fully elucidate the diverse mechanisms responsible for the creation of these enigmatic cosmic objects.  The ongoing synergy between theoretical modelling and observational astronomy will be emphasized throughout.
