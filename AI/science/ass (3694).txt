Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a crucial process with both significant energy generation potential and inherent safety challenges.  This presentation will provide an overview of the fundamental principles governing fission processes, focusing on the role of neutron interactions and the resulting chain reaction.  We will examine the key characteristics of fissile isotopes, such as uranium-235 and plutonium-239, highlighting their differing fission yields and neutron emission probabilities.  The presentation will then discuss the criticality condition and its relevance to reactor design and control, exploring the concepts of multiplication factor and delayed neutrons.  Furthermore, we will briefly touch upon the various types of nuclear reactors, emphasizing the differences in their designs and operational characteristics, including light water reactors (LWRs) and fast breeder reactors (FBRs). Finally, the presentation will conclude with a discussion of the challenges and opportunities associated with nuclear fission, particularly concerning waste management and the potential for advanced reactor technologies to address these issues.  The aim is to provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of this vital area of nuclear science and engineering.
