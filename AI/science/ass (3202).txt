Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of atomic orbitals, resulting in a decrease in the total energy of the system.  This stabilization is explained by the overlap of atomic orbitals, leading to the formation of molecular orbitals that encompass multiple nuclei.  The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that only two electrons, with opposing spins, can occupy a single molecular orbital.

The specific type of bonding—ionic, covalent, or metallic—depends on the relative electronegativities of the constituent atoms and the resultant electron distribution within the molecular orbitals.  Covalent bonds, for example, arise from significant orbital overlap and the sharing of electron density between atoms, while ionic bonds result from significant electron transfer, creating charged species.  Molecular geometry is dictated by the spatial arrangement of molecular orbitals that minimizes electron-electron repulsion and maximizes orbital overlap, a principle often explored via valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory, which is itself a consequence of the underlying quantum mechanics.  Ultimately, the properties of a molecule, such as reactivity and stability, are directly determined by its specific molecular structure, as dictated by the quantum mechanical interactions of its constituent electrons and nuclei.
