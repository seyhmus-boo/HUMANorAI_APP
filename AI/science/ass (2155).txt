Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that they exhibit correlated behavior, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation transcends classical physics, violating Bell's inequalities which demonstrate the incompatibility of local realism with quantum mechanics.  Entanglement arises from the superposition principle, where a composite system exists in a superposition of entangled states, described by a tensor product of individual state vectors.  Measurement on one entangled particle instantaneously collapses the wave function, determining the state of the other particle, irrespective of distance, leading to seemingly instantaneous communication, although no information transfer faster than light is possible (no-signaling theorem).  The density matrix formalism effectively describes entangled states, revealing their non-separability and highlighting the entanglement's strength through measures such as concurrence or entanglement entropy.  Applications of entanglement span quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation, leveraging its unique non-classical correlations for enhanced computational power and secure communication. The fundamental nature of entanglement continues to be a subject of intense research and philosophical debate.
