Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon first predicted by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in 1935 as a paradox challenging the completeness of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  These entangled systems exhibit correlated behavior regardless of the spatial separation between them, violating classical locality.  The EPR paradox highlighted the seemingly instantaneous influence between entangled particles, leading to debates on the nature of reality and the interpretation of quantum mechanics.  Bell's theorem, formulated in the 1960s, provided a testable framework to distinguish between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories, experimentally confirming the violation of Bell inequalities and solidifying the reality of entanglement.  Subsequent experiments, using increasingly sophisticated techniques, have demonstrated entanglement across diverse physical systems, including photons, ions, and superconducting circuits.  Today, quantum entanglement forms the foundation of emerging quantum technologies, such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography, promising transformative advancements in information processing and communication security. Ongoing research focuses on scaling entanglement to larger systems and exploring its fundamental implications for quantum foundations.
