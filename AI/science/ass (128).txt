Catalysts, substances that accelerate chemical reactions without being consumed themselves, are indispensable in organic chemistry. Their historical significance dates back to the early 19th century with Berzelius's initial observations, although a mechanistic understanding only emerged later.  In organic synthesis, catalysts dramatically enhance reaction rates and selectivities, often enabling reactions otherwise prohibitively slow or yielding unwanted side products.  This is achieved through the formation of transient intermediates, lowering the activation energy of the reaction pathway.

Two broad classes dominate: homogeneous catalysts, which exist in the same phase as the reactants (e.g., transition metal complexes in solution), and heterogeneous catalysts, typically solid surfaces offering active sites (e.g., zeolites in alkylation).  Homogeneous catalysts often exhibit greater selectivity due to precise control over the reaction environment.  Conversely, heterogeneous catalysts are easier to separate from the reaction mixture, proving advantageous in industrial processes.  Modern research focuses on developing increasingly efficient and environmentally benign catalysts, incorporating principles of green chemistry, such as biocatalysis utilizing enzymes.  The continued development of novel catalysts remains crucial for advancing synthetic organic chemistry and sustainable chemical processes.
