The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting such extreme gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape, remains a central area of investigation in astrophysics.  Early theoretical groundwork, laid by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century, posited the existence of "dark stars," objects so massive their escape velocity exceeded the speed of light.  However, these concepts lacked the rigorous framework of general relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century.  Einstein's theory provided the necessary mathematical foundation to describe the gravitational collapse of massive stars, predicting the existence of black holes as a potential endpoint of stellar evolution.  The subsequent decades witnessed significant theoretical advancements, including the seminal work of Oppenheimer and Snyder on spherically symmetric collapse, and the identification of key properties like the event horizon and singularity.  Observational evidence, initially elusive, has increasingly solidified the existence of black holes, ranging from the dynamical influence on nearby stars in binary systems to the detection of gravitational waves generated by their mergers.  This paper will delve into the current understanding of black hole formation mechanisms, encompassing various stellar mass and supermassive black hole progenitors, exploring the complexities of the collapse process and addressing outstanding questions regarding the formation of the most extreme black holes observed in the universe.
