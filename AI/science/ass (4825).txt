Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, demanding a comprehensive understanding of stellar evolution and gravitational collapse. This paper investigates the diverse mechanisms leading to black hole genesis, focusing on the interplay between stellar mass, metallicity, and binary interactions.  We review the canonical scenario of core-collapse supernovae in massive stars, highlighting recent advancements in numerical simulations that address issues of progenitor star structure, explosion energy, and the formation of a black hole remnant.  Furthermore, we explore alternative pathways, including direct collapse scenarios in low-metallicity environments, and the dynamical formation of black holes through mergers in dense stellar clusters.  A key aspect of this study involves comparing theoretical predictions with observational constraints from gravitational wave detections and electromagnetic counterparts associated with black hole mergers.  By systematically analyzing these diverse processes and their observational signatures, we aim to refine our understanding of the black hole mass function, its evolution across cosmic time, and its implications for galaxy formation and evolution.  This review provides a synthesis of current theoretical and observational knowledge, identifying critical outstanding questions requiring further investigation.
