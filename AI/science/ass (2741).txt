Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of sp²-bonded carbon atoms discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991.  This discovery revolutionized materials science, revealing a class of materials with exceptional characteristics.

CNTs exhibit extraordinary mechanical strength, surpassing steel in tensile strength by a significant margin.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to remarkable flexibility and resilience.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, comparable to copper, with the added advantage of being capable of exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality – the arrangement of carbon atoms within the tube.  This tunable conductivity opens doors for applications in electronics and sensing.  Finally, their high thermal conductivity makes them promising for thermal management applications.  These unique properties stem from the strong covalent bonding within the graphitic structure and the unique quantum effects associated with their nanoscale dimensions.  The ongoing research into CNTs continues to reveal novel applications, demonstrating their potential to transform various industries.
