Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, presents a profound departure from classical intuition.  This phenomenon, where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of spatial separation, defies local realism.  While initially considered a paradoxical consequence of the theory, entanglement has since been experimentally verified and forms the bedrock of emerging quantum technologies.  This paper examines entanglement from a purely quantum mechanical perspective, focusing on its mathematical formalism and implications for quantum information science.  We will explore the fundamental concepts of entangled states, typically represented by superposition states within a composite Hilbert space, and delve into the crucial role of Bell states as canonical examples.  Furthermore, we will discuss the implications of entanglement for violations of Bell inequalities, demonstrating the inherent non-locality of quantum mechanics and highlighting the departure from classical correlations.  Finally, we will briefly address the challenges and opportunities presented by the manipulation and application of entangled states in quantum computation and communication protocols.
