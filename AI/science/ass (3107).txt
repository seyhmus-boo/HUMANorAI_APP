Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a cornerstone of energy production and scientific inquiry.  This paper provides a comprehensive review of the underlying mechanisms and complexities inherent in nuclear fission processes. We examine the fundamental physics governing the interaction between neutrons and fissile nuclei, focusing on the probability of fission, the energy release spectrum, and the distribution of fission fragments.  Particular attention is paid to the influence of neutron energy and the characteristics of the target nucleus on the fission cross-section and the resulting fission products. The diverse range of fission phenomena, including spontaneous fission and induced fission across different isotopes, will be explored, highlighting the variations in yields and neutron emission. Furthermore, this review will discuss the ongoing research aimed at improving our understanding of fission dynamics,  particularly concerning the development of advanced nuclear reactor designs and the management of nuclear waste.  Ultimately, this paper aims to provide a consolidated perspective on the current state of knowledge regarding nuclear fission processes, bridging the gap between fundamental physics and practical applications.
