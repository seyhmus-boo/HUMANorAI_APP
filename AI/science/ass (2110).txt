CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient method for genome editing. This review summarizes the advancements and limitations of CRISPR technology in diverse applications.  The ease of design and implementation, coupled with high target specificity (although off-target effects remain a concern), has made CRISPR a powerful tool for gene knockout, knock-in, and base editing.  Applications range from fundamental research investigating gene function to therapeutic strategies targeting genetic diseases, including cancer and inherited disorders.  Clinical trials employing CRISPR-based therapies are underway, showcasing the translational potential of this technology.  However, challenges persist, including delivery efficiency to target tissues, immune responses to Cas proteins, and ethical considerations surrounding germline editing.  Ongoing research focuses on improving target specificity, developing novel Cas enzymes with altered properties, and exploring alternative delivery methods to address these limitations.  Despite these challenges, CRISPR technology continues to advance rapidly, promising significant breakthroughs in various fields of biology and medicine.
