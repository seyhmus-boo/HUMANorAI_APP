Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, possess exceptional properties rendering them highly attractive for diverse applications.  Their structure, comprising seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets, dictates their remarkable mechanical strength, exhibiting tensile strength significantly exceeding that of steel.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality â€“ the way the graphene sheet is rolled.  This unique electronic behavior is crucial for their use in nanoelectronics.  Their high aspect ratio and large surface area contribute to superior thermal conductivity and adsorption capabilities.

These properties translate into a wide array of potential applications.  High-strength composites incorporating CNTs are being developed for aerospace and automotive industries.  Their electrical conductivity finds use in advanced electronics, including transistors and flexible displays.  Their high surface area is exploited in energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries, and in catalysis.  However, challenges remain regarding scalable, cost-effective production and dispersion of CNTs for widespread commercialization.
