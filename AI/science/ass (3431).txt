Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on chemical bonding and its influence on molecular structure.  Early understandings, dating back to Dalton's atomic theory, posited atoms as indivisible units. However, the limitations of this model became apparent with the discovery of molecules and the need to explain their stability.  The development of quantum mechanics revolutionized our understanding, leading to the elucidation of primary bonding types: ionic bonds, arising from electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions; covalent bonds, formed by the sharing of electron pairs; and metallic bonds, characteristic of metals and involving delocalized electrons.  These bonds dictate the geometry of molecules, a crucial aspect determined by factors such as electron-pair repulsion and hybridisation. Molecular structure, in turn, dictates a molecule's physical and chemical properties, including reactivity, polarity, and boiling point.  Understanding the interplay between bonding and structure is fundamental to predicting and explaining chemical behaviour, a concept we will explore further in subsequent lectures.
