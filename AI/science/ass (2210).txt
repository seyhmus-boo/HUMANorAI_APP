Nuclear fission, the splitting of atomic nuclei, remains a process of paramount importance, impacting fields far beyond the purely physical. This research paper explores the multifaceted nature of nuclear fission processes, highlighting its significant interdisciplinary links.  While rooted in nuclear physics, encompassing concepts such as quantum mechanics and strong nuclear forces, the practical applications and consequences of fission extend profoundly into other disciplines.  Chemical engineering plays a crucial role in the design and operation of nuclear reactors, addressing challenges related to fuel processing, waste management, and the prevention of criticality accidents.  Furthermore, the societal implications of nuclear fission are substantial, necessitating contributions from social scientists, economists, and political scientists to grapple with issues of energy security, proliferation risk, and the long-term management of radioactive waste.  This study aims to synthesize these interdisciplinary perspectives, examining not only the fundamental physics of fission but also its broader societal, economic, and environmental consequences.  By exploring these interconnections, we seek to provide a holistic understanding of the complexities surrounding this powerful and controversial technology.
