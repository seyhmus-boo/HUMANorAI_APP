Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  These cylindrical structures, composed solely of sp²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  Their extraordinary tensile strength, exceeding that of steel at a fraction of the weight, makes them ideal for reinforcing composite materials in aerospace and automotive applications.

Electrically, CNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials, depending on their chirality – the arrangement of their carbon atoms. This tunable conductivity is crucial for developing advanced electronics, including transistors and flexible displays.  Furthermore, their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, making them suitable for thermal management systems.

However, challenges remain.  Controlling the precise chirality during synthesis and achieving large-scale, cost-effective production are ongoing areas of research. Despite these hurdles, the unique combination of properties exhibited by CNTs promises revolutionary advancements across diverse fields, from energy storage in supercapacitors to biomedical applications like targeted drug delivery.
