Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, has been a subject of scientific inquiry for centuries.  Early understanding, dating back to Jan Ingenhousz's 1779 experiments, revealed the dependence on light and the production of oxygen.  However, the precise mechanisms remained elusive until the 20th century.

Modern understanding distinguishes two main photosynthetic pathways: C3 and C4.  C3, prevalent in most plants, involves the initial fixation of CO2 by RuBisCO, forming a three-carbon compound (3-PGA). This process occurs within the chloroplast's stroma, alongside the light-dependent reactions, which utilize photosystems I and II to generate ATP and NADPH.  These molecules then power the Calvin cycle, reducing 3-PGA to glucose.

C4 photosynthesis, an adaptation to arid conditions, pre-fixes CO2 in mesophyll cells using PEP carboxylase, minimizing photorespiration. This four-carbon compound is then transported to bundle sheath cells, where the decarboxylation releases CO2 for RuBisCO fixation.  Both pathways share the fundamental principles of light absorption, electron transport, and carbon fixation, but differ strategically in their carbon assimilation strategies to optimize energy conversion under varying environmental conditions.
