DNA replication, a fundamental process for cellular proliferation and heredity, ensures the faithful duplication of the genome prior to cell division.  This intricate process initiates at specific origins of replication, where the double helix unwinds, facilitated by helicases and single-strand binding proteins.  This unwinding generates replication forks, progressing bidirectionally.  Leading strand synthesis occurs continuously via DNA polymerase, utilizing a primer synthesized by primase.  Lagging strand synthesis, proceeding in a discontinuous manner, involves the creation of Okazaki fragments, each requiring a separate primer.  DNA ligase then joins these fragments, forming a continuous strand.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases, minimizing errors during nucleotide incorporation.  Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, present a challenge due to the inability of DNA polymerase to replicate the terminal 3' end.  Telomerase, a specialized enzyme, extends telomeres in certain cells, mitigating this problem.  The overall process is tightly regulated, ensuring precise replication and genomic stability.
