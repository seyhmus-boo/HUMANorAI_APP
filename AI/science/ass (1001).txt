This review summarizes fundamental concepts in chemical bonding and molecular structure, emphasizing their predictive power in understanding macroscopic properties.  We examine the primary bonding models—ionic, covalent, and metallic—highlighting the role of electronegativity differences and valence electron configurations in determining bond type and polarity.  The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory is discussed as a crucial tool for predicting molecular geometry,  alongside the more sophisticated Valence Bond (VB) and Molecular Orbital (MO) theories, which provide a more detailed description of bonding interactions and electron distribution.  Hybridisation concepts are explored in relation to molecular geometry and reactivity.  The impact of intermolecular forces, including hydrogen bonding, dipole-dipole interactions, and London dispersion forces, on physical properties such as boiling point and solubility is also reviewed.  While simple models provide useful approximations, the review underscores the limitations of these models and emphasizes the need for advanced computational techniques for accurate predictions, particularly in complex systems.  Future research directions include the development of more robust theoretical frameworks for predicting the properties of novel materials and molecules.
