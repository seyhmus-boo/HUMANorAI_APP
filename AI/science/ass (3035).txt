DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating the genome, is fundamental to life.  Early experiments, notably the Meselson-Stahl experiment using isotopic labeling, definitively demonstrated its semiconservative nature, refuting conservative and dispersive models.  This landmark study, conducted in 1958, established that each newly synthesized DNA molecule consists of one parental strand and one newly synthesized daughter strand.

The process itself is initiated at specific origins of replication, where DNA helicase unwinds the double helix, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the unwound strands, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a starting point for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for adding nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments, which are later joined by DNA ligase.  Telomerase addresses the replication problem at chromosome ends.  Proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerase minimize errors, maintaining genomic integrity.  The intricate coordination of these enzymes and proteins ensures accurate and efficient duplication of the genetic material, crucial for cell division and inheritance.
