Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy.  Imagine a carefully balanced stack of dominoes:  the heavy nucleus is akin to this precarious structure, representing a high-energy state.  A neutron, analogous to a slight nudge or disturbance, triggers the collapse.  This “nudge” overcomes the strong nuclear force holding the nucleus together, causing it to fission.

The splitting releases not only smaller nuclei – the “fallen dominoes” – but also additional neutrons, akin to the cascading effect of the dominoes themselves. These newly released neutrons can then initiate further fission events in nearby nuclei, creating a chain reaction – a cascading wave of falling dominoes.  This chain reaction, if uncontrolled, leads to an exponential release of energy, as seen in nuclear explosions.  However, in controlled fission reactors, the chain reaction is carefully moderated to sustain a steady energy output, analogous to controlling the rate at which the dominoes fall.  The released energy is primarily kinetic energy of the fission fragments, converted into heat that drives turbines for electricity generation.
