Black hole formation is a consequence of extreme gravitational collapse.  When a sufficiently massive star (generally exceeding 20 solar masses) exhausts its nuclear fuel, the outward pressure from fusion ceases.  Overcoming electron degeneracy pressure and, subsequently, neutron degeneracy pressure, the star's core implodes under its own gravity.  If the core's mass surpasses the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), no known force can prevent the collapse, resulting in a singularity – a point of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon.  This event horizon defines the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

While black holes themselves are not directly applicable for terrestrial use, their study yields profound insights into fundamental physics.  Understanding black hole accretion disks informs models of high-energy astrophysical phenomena like quasars and active galactic nuclei.  Furthermore, gravitational wave astronomy, enabled by the detection of spacetime ripples caused by black hole mergers, provides a novel method for probing the universe's evolution and testing Einstein's theory of General Relativity under extreme conditions. The theoretical framework surrounding black holes also advances our understanding of spacetime itself and quantum gravity.
