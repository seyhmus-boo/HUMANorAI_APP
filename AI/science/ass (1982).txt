Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties underpinning their diverse applications across multiple disciplines.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, stemming from the strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds, makes them ideal for reinforcement in composite materials, a key area of materials science and engineering.  Their high aspect ratio and unique electronic structure, tunable between metallic and semiconducting depending on chirality, are exploited in nanotechnology for applications ranging from field-effect transistors (electronics) to biosensors (bioengineering).

The exceptional thermal conductivity of CNTs, exceeding that of diamond in certain orientations, is of significant interest in thermal management for microelectronics and energy applications.  Moreover, their large surface area offers potential in catalysis, environmental remediation (e.g., water purification), and energy storage (e.g., supercapacitors).  Interdisciplinary collaborations are essential to fully exploit these properties, integrating expertise in chemistry, physics, materials science, and engineering to overcome challenges in synthesis, processing, and large-scale integration for practical applications.
