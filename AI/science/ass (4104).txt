Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, is a process releasing substantial energy governed by the strong and weak nuclear forces.  This exothermic reaction, primarily induced by neutron bombardment of fissile isotopes like Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, proceeds through a chain reaction as emitted neutrons trigger further fissions.  The resulting energy release, characterized by the mass defect according to Einstein's E=mcÂ², is harnessed in nuclear power plants for electricity generation.  Controlled fission reactions within reactors utilize moderators and control rods to regulate the chain reaction rate, ensuring safe and efficient energy production.  However, uncontrolled fission forms the basis of nuclear weapons, highlighting the dual-use nature of this process.  Beyond energy production, fission finds application in medical radioisotope production for diagnostics and therapy, neutron activation analysis for elemental composition determination, and scientific research concerning nuclear physics and material science.  Despite safety concerns and waste management challenges, nuclear fission remains a significant source of energy and a crucial tool in various scientific and technological fields.
