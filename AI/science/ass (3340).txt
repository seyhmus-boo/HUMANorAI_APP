Catalysts have been instrumental in the advancement of organic chemistry, enabling reactions that would otherwise be impractically slow or require extreme conditions.  Historically, their use dates back to ancient civilizations, although the underlying principles remained elusive until the 19th and 20th centuries.  Early observations of catalytic activity, such as the use of sulfuric acid in esterification, were largely empirical.  The development of physical chemistry provided the theoretical framework to understand catalysis, particularly the lowering of activation energy achieved by the catalyst-substrate interaction.

In organic chemistry, catalysts broadly function by either forming intermediate complexes with reactants, altering the reaction mechanism, or providing alternative reaction pathways with lower activation barriers.  This often involves the creation of transient bonds between the catalyst and reactants, facilitating bond breaking and formation.  Homogeneous catalysts, dissolved in the reaction medium, offer intimate interaction with reactants while heterogeneous catalysts, present in a separate phase, provide surface-mediated catalysis.  The design and synthesis of increasingly sophisticated catalysts, including organometallic complexes and enzymes, are areas of ongoing research, driving progress in diverse applications from pharmaceuticals to materials science.
