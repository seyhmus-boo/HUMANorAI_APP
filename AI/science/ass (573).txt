Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the intricate mechanisms of photosynthesis.  Essentially, plants act as solar-powered factories, converting light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose.  This process unfolds in two key stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle.

Imagine the light-dependent reactions as a power plant.  Sunlight, the primary energy source, excites electrons in chlorophyll, much like a power plant's fuel ignites a reaction. This energy is used to split water molecules (photolysis), generating oxygen as a byproduct – think of it as exhaust.  The energized electrons then power the creation of ATP and NADPH, acting as energy-carrying "batteries" for the next stage.

The Calvin cycle, on the other hand, is akin to an assembly line.  Using the ATP and NADPH “batteries” generated earlier, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is “fixed” – incorporated into organic molecules – through a series of enzymatic reactions.  These reactions ultimately construct glucose, the factory's final product, a stable energy-rich molecule for the plant's growth and maintenance.  Thus, light energy is effectively transformed into chemical energy, sustaining life on Earth.
