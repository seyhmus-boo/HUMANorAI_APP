Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices.  These properties are significantly influenced by both the diameter and chirality of the nanotube.  Their exceptionally high aspect ratio results in remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile strength exceeding that of steel by several orders of magnitude, and a high Young's modulus signifying exceptional stiffness.  Furthermore, CNTs possess outstanding electrical conductivity, exhibiting behaviour ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on their chirality.  Metallic nanotubes display high electrical conductivity comparable to copper, while semiconducting nanotubes demonstrate band gaps tunable through diameter control, offering potential for nanoelectronic applications.  Beyond these, CNTs demonstrate exceptional thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper, leading to their exploration in thermal management applications.  Finally, their large surface area contributes to significant adsorption properties, making them valuable in areas such as gas storage and catalysis.  The remarkable combination of these properties has driven extensive research into diverse applications, ranging from composites and electronics to energy storage and biomedical devices.
