Nuclear fission is the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the process.  Imagine a carefully balanced stack of dominoes:  the heavy nucleus is akin to this precarious structure, held together by strong nuclear forces, analogous to the delicate balance between the dominoes.  When a neutron, a subatomic particle, strikes the nucleus (like a carefully placed push on a single domino), this balance is disrupted. The nucleus becomes unstable and undergoes fission, fracturing into smaller nuclei (like the dominoes cascading).  This fracturing releases not only smaller nuclei, but also a considerable amount of kinetic energy,  represented by the rapid movement of the toppling dominoes. Furthermore, the fission process typically yields additional neutrons (like the toppling dominoes initiating a chain reaction), which can then trigger further fission events in nearby nuclei, leading to a chain reaction â€“ a self-sustaining cascade of nuclear fissions, analogous to the entire domino stack collapsing. The magnitude of energy released is substantial, far exceeding that of chemical reactions, making fission a powerful energy source but demanding careful control to prevent uncontrolled chain reactions.
