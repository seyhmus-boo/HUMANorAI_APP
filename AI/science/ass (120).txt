Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is a process underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry.  Its theoretical underpinnings were laid in the 1930s following the discovery of the neutron by James Chadwick.  Enrico Fermi's experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons, while initially misinterpreted as creating transuranic elements, inadvertently initiated fission.  Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch subsequently elucidated the process, correctly identifying the release of enormous energy as a consequence of the mass defect described by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  

Fission is initiated when a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, absorbs a neutron.  This destabilizes the nucleus, leading to its fission into two daughter nuclei, accompanied by the release of further neutrons and a significant amount of energy.  These released neutrons can, in turn, induce fission in other fissile nuclei, creating a chain reaction.  Control of this chain reaction is crucial in nuclear reactors, achieved through neutron moderators and control rods that absorb neutrons, regulating the fission rate and preventing runaway reactions.  The uncontrolled chain reaction forms the basis of nuclear weapons.
