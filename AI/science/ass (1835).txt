Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of sp²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit a unique combination of properties that underpin their diverse applications.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from strong covalent bonds within the graphitic lattice, surpasses that of steel at a significantly lower density.  This, coupled with high tensile modulus and flexibility, makes them ideal for reinforcement in composite materials, improving structural integrity and reducing weight.

Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, comparable to copper, owing to their delocalized π-electrons.  This, along with their high aspect ratio, allows for applications in electronics, including transparent conductive films, field-effect transistors, and interconnects.  Their high thermal conductivity contributes to their use in thermal management applications.

However, the practical implementation of CNTs faces challenges.  Producing large quantities of high-quality, consistently structured CNTs remains costly and complex.  Furthermore, dispersion and functionalization of CNTs are crucial for optimal integration into various matrices, influencing their overall performance in applications.  Despite these hurdles, the exceptional properties of CNTs offer significant potential for advancements across multiple scientific and engineering fields.
