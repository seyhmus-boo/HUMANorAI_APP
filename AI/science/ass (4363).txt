Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, represents a pivotal scientific discovery with profound implications for energy production and global affairs. This presentation will provide a concise overview of fission processes, tracing their historical development from the theoretical predictions of nuclear physics in the early 20th century to their practical applications.  We will explore the seminal work of scientists like Lise Meitner, Otto Hahn, and Fritz Strassmann, whose experimental observations of uranium fission in 1938 revolutionized our understanding of nuclear structure and energy release. The presentation will then delve into the underlying physics of fission, focusing on the crucial role of neutron interactions and the concept of criticality.  Different fissionable isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, and their respective fission yields will be discussed, highlighting the variations in energy release and the production of radioactive byproducts.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the diverse applications of fission, encompassing nuclear power generation and nuclear weaponry, acknowledging both the immense potential benefits and the significant challenges related to nuclear waste management and proliferation.
