Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional properties, continue to be a subject of intense research.  Their unique combination of high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity (depending on chirality), and high thermal conductivity makes them attractive for diverse applications. Recent developments have focused on improving control over CNT synthesis, enabling the production of highly pure, single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) with specific chiralities â€“ a critical step towards realizing their full potential.  Advances in functionalization techniques allow for tailored surface modifications, enhancing their dispersibility in various matrices and facilitating integration into composite materials.

Significant progress has also been made in understanding the long-term stability and toxicity of CNTs, addressing concerns about their potential environmental and health impacts.  Research into novel applications, such as next-generation energy storage devices (e.g., high-capacity batteries and supercapacitors), advanced sensors, and high-performance composites, remains prolific.  While challenges related to scalability and cost-effective production persist, the recent advancements in CNT synthesis, functionalization, and characterization are paving the way for their widespread adoption across numerous technological domains.  Further exploration into their biocompatibility and the development of robust manufacturing processes are key areas for future research.
