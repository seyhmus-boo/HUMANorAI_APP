Plasma physics, the study of ionized gases, emerged from late 19th-century investigations into gas discharges.  Early researchers like Crookes and Faraday observed anomalous behaviours in these discharges, laying groundwork for understanding the collective behaviour of charged particles.  The crucial step was the recognition of plasma as a distinct state of matter, distinct from solids, liquids, and gases,  characterized by collective effects arising from long-range Coulomb interactions.  This understanding developed significantly in the mid-20th century, driven by the advent of controlled nuclear fusion research, which necessitates intricate understanding of plasma confinement and heating.

Key phenomena studied encompass waves (e.g., Langmuir waves, Alfv√©n waves), instabilities (e.g., Rayleigh-Taylor, drift-wave instabilities), and various transport processes dictated by plasma microturbulence.  These phenomena are governed by a complex interplay of electromagnetic fields and particle dynamics, described by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and kinetic theory.  Modern research explores diverse applications including fusion energy, space physics (e.g., solar wind, magnetospheres), and materials processing.  Despite considerable progress, several crucial aspects, such as turbulent transport and magnetic reconnection, remain active areas of investigation.
