CRISPR-Cas systems, revolutionizing genetic engineering, have transitioned from a bacterial defense mechanism to a precise gene editing tool in a remarkably short time.  This presentation will trace the historical evolution of CRISPR technology, beginning with its discovery as a clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats system in bacterial genomes in the early 1990s.  Initial characterizations highlighted its role in adaptive immunity against invading bacteriophages.  A pivotal breakthrough came with the elucidation of the mechanism by which CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, particularly Cas9, target and cleave specific DNA sequences guided by CRISPR RNA (crRNA).  This mechanistic understanding, coupled with the development of simplified guide RNA (gRNA) systems, enabled the adaptation of CRISPR-Cas9 for targeted genome editing in eukaryotic cells.  The presentation will then briefly explore the diverse applications of CRISPR technology, including gene knockouts, knockins, base editing, and prime editing, highlighting both the immense therapeutic potential in treating genetic diseases and the ethical considerations surrounding its use in gene therapy and beyond.  Finally, we will touch upon current challenges and future directions in CRISPR research, focusing on off-target effects and the development of next-generation CRISPR systems.
