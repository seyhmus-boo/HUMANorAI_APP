Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of the spatial separation.  This correlation surpasses classical physics; measuring the property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the corresponding property of the other, even across vast distances.  Imagine flipping two coins that are magically linked: if one lands heads, the other *must* land tails, irrespective of the distance between them. This is analogous to entanglement, but instead of heads/tails, we're dealing with quantum properties like spin or polarization.

Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance," highlighting the apparent violation of locality â€“ the principle that an object can only be influenced by its immediate surroundings.  However, while the correlation is instantaneous, it doesn't allow for faster-than-light communication.  The outcome of the measurement on one particle is random; we cannot control which result we obtain, precluding its use for superluminal signaling.  Instead, entanglement provides a powerful resource for quantum technologies like quantum computing and cryptography, leveraging this non-classical correlation for enhanced computational power and secure communication protocols. The precise nature of entanglement, particularly its implications for realism and locality, remains a subject of ongoing investigation and debate.
