Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of sp²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.  These properties underpin their diverse potential applications.  Their exceptionally high aspect ratio, often exceeding 1000:1, leads to remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile strength surpassing that of steel and Young's modulus rivaling that of diamond.  This exceptional strength is coupled with remarkable flexibility and elasticity, allowing them to withstand significant deformation.  Furthermore, CNTs display outstanding electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality – the arrangement of the hexagonal carbon lattice.  This electronic versatility has implications for electronics and sensor technologies.  Their thermal conductivity is also significantly high, exceeding that of copper, making them attractive for thermal management applications. Finally, their large surface area provides opportunities in catalysis and gas storage.  The precise control and manipulation of these properties, however, remain significant challenges for realizing their full potential across various fields.
