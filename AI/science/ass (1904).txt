Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized structure.  Their extraordinary tensile strength, exceeding that of steel at a significantly lower density, makes them attractive for reinforcing composites.  Depending on chirality, CNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials, offering potential for advanced electronics, including high-frequency transistors and flexible displays.  Their high aspect ratio and surface area contribute to their excellent thermal conductivity, promising applications in thermal management systems and heat sinks.  Furthermore, their biocompatibility,  although still under investigation,  suggests potential for biomedical applications such as drug delivery and biosensors.  However, challenges remain in scaling up production of high-quality, defect-free CNTs and in developing effective dispersion techniques to fully harness their potential.  Ongoing research focuses on improving synthesis methods, characterizing structure-property relationships, and exploring novel applications in energy storage, water purification, and environmental remediation.
