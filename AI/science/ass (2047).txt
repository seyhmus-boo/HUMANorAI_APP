Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have spurred extensive research into their diverse applications.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, surpassing those of steel, stem from the strong covalent bonds within their hexagonal lattice.  Electrical conductivity varies significantly depending on chirality and diameter; single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) can behave as metallic or semiconducting materials, offering potential for nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT growth and achieving uniform dispersion in composite materials.  This review summarizes the key properties of CNTs, highlighting the influence of structural parameters on their macroscopic behavior.  We discuss the potential applications of CNTs in areas such as advanced composites, energy storage, and biomedical devices, while acknowledging the ongoing research focused on overcoming limitations associated with their processing and scalability for widespread implementation.  Future work should concentrate on developing scalable and cost-effective methods for producing high-quality, well-defined CNTs to fully exploit their unique capabilities.
