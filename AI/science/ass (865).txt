This presentation provides a concise overview of DNA replication, a fundamental process underpinning life's continuity.  We will explore the intricate mechanisms involved, including the roles of key enzymes such as DNA polymerases, helicases, and primases, and the significance of processes like primer synthesis, leading and lagging strand synthesis, and proofreading.  The presentation will elucidate the remarkable fidelity and speed of this crucial process, highlighting its inherent error correction mechanisms that minimize mutations.  

Beyond the biological fundamentals, we will delve into the practical applications stemming from our understanding of DNA replication. These applications include advancements in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, crucial for diagnostics, forensics, and genetic research. Furthermore, we will discuss the relevance of replication mechanisms to cancer biology, where uncontrolled replication contributes significantly to tumour growth, and highlight how this knowledge is informing the development of novel anticancer therapies targeting key replication enzymes.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the burgeoning field of synthetic biology, where manipulating replication machinery is paving the way for innovative applications in biotechnology and biomanufacturing.
