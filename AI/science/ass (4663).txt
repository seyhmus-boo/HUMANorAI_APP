Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a cornerstone of nuclear energy production and a subject of ongoing scientific investigation. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms, influencing factors, and potential applications beyond energy generation.  We begin by examining the fundamental physics governing fission, including the role of nuclear forces, neutron interactions, and the energy release associated with mass defect.  A detailed analysis of different fissionable isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, and their respective fission yields is then presented, emphasizing the variation in fission fragment distributions and the resultant neutron emission. Furthermore, the paper explores the criticality conditions necessary for sustaining a chain reaction, examining factors like neutron multiplication factor, reactor geometry, and moderator materials.  Finally, we discuss contemporary research directions, including advanced reactor designs aimed at enhancing safety and efficiency, and the potential role of fission in addressing future energy demands and the challenges associated with nuclear waste management. This review aims to provide a current understanding of nuclear fission processes for a broad scientific audience.
