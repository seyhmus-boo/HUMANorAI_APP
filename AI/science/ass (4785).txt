Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional material properties that have spurred extensive research across numerous disciplines. This presentation will provide an overview of the key properties of CNTs, focusing on their unique structure-property relationships.  We will examine the influence of chirality and diameter on their electronic behaviour, ranging from metallic to semiconducting characteristics, highlighting the potential for applications in nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, the mechanical properties of CNTs, including their exceptional tensile strength and Young's modulus, will be discussed, along with their implications for advanced composite materials and structural applications. The thermal conductivity of CNTs, significantly higher than that of many other materials, and its dependence on structural parameters will also be addressed.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and functionalization, crucial for their effective integration into practical devices and technologies. The broad range of remarkable properties makes CNTs a promising material for a diverse array of future applications, spanning from energy storage and biomedical devices to aerospace engineering and environmental remediation.
