Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties that have spurred significant research interest across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines.  This presentation will review the key properties underpinning CNT applications, focusing on their exceptional mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, and unique thermal characteristics.  We will discuss the dependence of these properties on nanotube diameter, chirality, and structural defects.  The exceptional tensile strength and Young's modulus of CNTs, surpassing those of steel, make them ideal candidates for reinforcement in composite materials. Their electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior depending on chirality, opens possibilities for advanced electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit remarkably high thermal conductivity, making them suitable for thermal management applications.  The presentation will also briefly address challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and processing, and highlight ongoing research efforts focused on overcoming these limitations to realize the full potential of CNTs in practical applications, including energy storage, biomedical devices, and advanced manufacturing.  Finally, future research directions will be outlined, emphasizing the potential for tailored CNT properties through controlled synthesis and functionalization.
