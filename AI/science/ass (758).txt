Catalysts are indispensable in modern organic chemistry, dramatically accelerating reaction rates and enabling transformations otherwise inaccessible under conventional conditions.  Their impact spans synthesis, allowing for greater selectivity and efficiency, and impacting areas like pharmaceuticals and materials science.  Traditionally, homogeneous catalysts, dissolved in the reaction medium, dominated. However, recent developments strongly favor heterogeneous catalysts, due to their ease of separation and reusability, reducing waste and cost.

Significant advancements include the rise of single-site heterogeneous catalysts, mimicking the precision of homogeneous systems while retaining the advantages of heterogeneous phases.  Furthermore, the field has witnessed an explosion in the application of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as highly tunable and porous catalytic supports.  Research focuses on developing robust, recyclable catalysts with enhanced activity and selectivity, often leveraging computational methods for catalyst design and optimization.  The integration of photocatalysis and electrocatalysis further expands the scope of catalytic transformations, opening avenues for sustainable and environmentally benign organic synthesis.
