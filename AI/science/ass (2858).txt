This presentation explores the unique properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through a quantum mechanical lens.  We will delve into the electronic structure of CNTs, focusing on the crucial role of π-electron delocalization within the sp² hybridized carbon network.  The chirality of the CNT, determined by its (n,m) indices, dictates its band structure, leading to a diverse range of electronic behaviour, from metallic to semiconducting.  We will examine how the quantum confinement effect, arising from the nanotube's nanoscale diameter, significantly influences the energy band gap and density of states.  Furthermore, we will discuss the impact of quantum mechanical principles on other key properties, including exceptional mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, and unique optical characteristics.  Specific examples will illustrate how density functional theory (DFT) calculations are employed to predict and understand these properties, highlighting the vital role of quantum mechanics in designing and utilizing CNTs for advanced applications in fields ranging from electronics and energy storage to composite materials and biomedical sensing.  The presentation will conclude with an outlook on future research directions in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.
