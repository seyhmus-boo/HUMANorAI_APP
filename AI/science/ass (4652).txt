DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning heredity and cellular proliferation, is conventionally understood through a classical biochemical lens.  However, recent advances in understanding quantum phenomena in biological systems suggest that quantum mechanical effects may play a subtle yet potentially significant role in this seemingly well-characterized process.  This paper explores the emerging field of quantum biology as applied to DNA replication, focusing on the potential contributions of quantum phenomena to specific stages of the process.  We will examine the theoretical possibilities of quantum entanglement influencing base pairing fidelity, tunneling effects facilitating enzyme-substrate interactions, and the role of coherent vibrational energy transfer in the efficiency and accuracy of replication.  While experimental evidence remains limited,  computational modeling and theoretical investigations are increasingly pointing towards the possibility of quantum mechanical enhancements to the speed and accuracy of DNA replication.  This review synthesizes current research in this interdisciplinary area, highlighting both the significant challenges and the exciting potential for a more complete understanding of DNA replication by incorporating quantum mechanical principles.  Specifically, we will discuss the limitations of classical models in fully explaining certain aspects of replication fidelity and explore how a quantum perspective can offer a more nuanced interpretation.
