Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with unique cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile moduli exceeding that of steel, is attributed to the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheets composing their walls.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality and diameter, enabling applications in electronics and sensing.  Their high aspect ratio and large surface area contribute to significant advancements in energy storage, with recent research focusing on enhancing the performance of lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors through CNT-based electrodes.  Recent developments also include the synthesis of highly-aligned CNT arrays via techniques like chemical vapor deposition, facilitating the fabrication of macroscopic CNT-based components.  Furthermore, ongoing research explores the functionalization of CNTs through covalent or non-covalent modifications to improve their dispersibility in various matrices and tailor their properties for specific applications, such as biomedical imaging and drug delivery.  The unique combination of these properties continues to drive innovation across numerous scientific and technological fields.
