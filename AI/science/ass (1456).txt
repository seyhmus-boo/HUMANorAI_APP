CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in genome editing.  This presentation will provide an overview of CRISPR's mechanism and its applications, focusing on recent advancements that expand its capabilities and address limitations.  We will explore the development of novel Cas enzymes with altered specificities, enabling targeting of previously inaccessible genomic sequences and minimizing off-target effects.  Significant progress has been made in base editing, which allows for precise single nucleotide changes without double-stranded DNA breaks, reducing the risk of deleterious genomic rearrangements.  Furthermore, the burgeoning field of prime editing, offering even greater precision and versatility, will be discussed.  The presentation will also touch upon the expanding applications of CRISPR beyond gene correction, including its use in gene regulation, epigenetic modification, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies for various diseases. Finally, we will briefly address the ethical considerations surrounding CRISPR technology and the importance of responsible innovation in this rapidly evolving field.
