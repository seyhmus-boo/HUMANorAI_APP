Plasma physics, the study of ionized gases, emerged from late 19th-century investigations into gas discharges.  Early researchers, like Sir William Crookes, observed anomalous behaviour in cathode ray tubes, hinting at a distinct state of matter beyond gas.  The formal designation "plasma," coined by Irving Langmuir in the 1920s, highlighted the collective behaviour of these ionized particles, emphasizing their quasi-neutrality and susceptibility to electromagnetic fields.

Key phenomena within plasma physics include Debye shielding, where the collective action of charged particles screens out electric fields; plasma oscillations, arising from the restoring force of displaced charges; and various instabilities, such as the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, which governs the interaction of fluids with different densities.  These phenomena manifest in a variety of scales, from laboratory experiments – like fusion reactors – to astrophysical contexts, encompassing solar flares, nebulae, and the interstellar medium.  The field continues to evolve, driven by both fundamental scientific inquiries and technological applications ranging from semiconductor manufacturing to advanced propulsion systems.
