Black hole formation is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, primarily arising from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core loses outward pressure, initiating a catastrophic inward collapse.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), no known force can counteract gravity, resulting in the formation of a singularity – a black hole.  This process is relatively well-understood for stellar-mass black holes.

Recent developments focus on supermassive black holes (SMBHs), millions to billions of solar masses residing at galactic centers.  The formation mechanism of SMBHs remains debated, with leading hypotheses including the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe and the merger of numerous stellar-mass black holes.  Gravitational wave observations, like those from LIGO and Virgo, provide crucial data on black hole mergers, revealing information about their masses and spins, shedding light on the hierarchical growth pathway of SMBHs.  Furthermore, advanced simulations incorporating feedback processes from active galactic nuclei (AGN) are improving our understanding of the interplay between SMBH growth and galactic evolution. These ongoing efforts promise to further refine our understanding of black hole formation across all mass scales.
