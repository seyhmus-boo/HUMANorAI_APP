Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the interplay of the strong and Coulomb forces, both of which are inherently quantum mechanical in nature.  The strong nuclear force, a short-range attractive force mediated by gluons, binds protons and neutrons together, overcoming the repulsive electrostatic force between protons. However, in heavy nuclei with a large number of protons, the Coulomb repulsion becomes increasingly significant, destabilizing the nucleus.  Quantum tunneling plays a crucial role; the probability of a nucleus overcoming the potential barrier separating it from a fissioned state is non-zero, even if the nucleus initially lacks sufficient kinetic energy to surmount the barrier classically.  This tunneling probability is determined by the height and width of the potential barrier, which are themselves dependent on the nuclear shape and the distribution of nucleons, described by quantum wave functions.  The fission process itself can be modeled using various quantum mechanical approaches, such as the liquid drop model, which incorporates surface tension and Coulomb forces, and more sophisticated shell models which account for the quantized energy levels of individual nucleons.  The subsequent decay of the fission fragments further involves quantum mechanical processes, including beta decay and gamma-ray emission, governed by the weak and electromagnetic interactions respectively.
