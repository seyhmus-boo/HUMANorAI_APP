Photosynthesis, the cornerstone of life on Earth, remains a fertile ground for investigation, particularly from a quantum mechanical perspective.  This presentation will explore the remarkable efficiency of light harvesting and energy transfer within photosynthetic complexes, focusing on the role of quantum coherence. We will delve into the evidence supporting the involvement of quantum phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, in enhancing the efficiency of excitation energy transfer between light-harvesting antennae and reaction centers.  The presentation will discuss specific examples, including the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex and the light-harvesting complexes of purple bacteria, highlighting experimental techniques like two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy used to probe these quantum effects.  Furthermore, we will address ongoing debates regarding the functional significance of quantum coherence in natural photosynthesis and consider the potential for bio-inspired technologies leveraging these principles in the development of artificial light-harvesting systems. Finally, we will briefly discuss open questions and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.
