Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and ionizing radiation (neutrons, gamma rays, beta particles).  This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the total mass of the products is less than the original nucleus, the difference being converted into energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  The process is initiated by neutron bombardment, which induces instability and ultimately, the fission event.  A crucial aspect is the chain reaction:  each fission event releases further neutrons, capable of initiating subsequent fissions, leading to a self-sustaining reaction if the critical mass of fissile material is achieved.

Practical applications of nuclear fission are predominantly found in nuclear power generation.  Controlled chain reactions within nuclear reactors produce heat, used to generate steam and drive turbines for electricity production.  Furthermore, nuclear fission has military applications, notably in nuclear weapons, where uncontrolled chain reactions result in a massive, instantaneous energy release.  While offering substantial energy production capabilities, nuclear fission poses significant challenges related to radioactive waste management and the potential for accidents, demanding robust safety protocols and long-term solutions for waste disposal.
