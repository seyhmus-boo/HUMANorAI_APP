Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, proceeds via two fundamentally distinct stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The light-dependent reactions, occurring in the thylakoid membranes, involve photosystems I and II.  These photosystems, comprising chlorophyll and accessory pigments, absorb photons, exciting electrons to higher energy levels.  Electron transport chains, coupled with proton pumping, generate a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, driving ATP synthesis via chemiosmosis.  Simultaneously, water is split (photolysis), providing electrons to replace those lost by photosystem II and releasing oxygen as a byproduct.  NADP+ is reduced to NADPH, serving as a reducing agent in the subsequent Calvin cycle.  The light-independent reactions, taking place in the stroma, utilize ATP and NADPH to fix atmospheric CO2 into organic molecules, primarily glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  Regulation of photosynthesis is intricately linked to environmental factors such as light intensity, CO2 concentration, and temperature, influencing the activity of key enzymes and the expression of photosynthetic genes.  Further research focuses on enhancing photosynthetic efficiency to improve crop yields and address climate change.
