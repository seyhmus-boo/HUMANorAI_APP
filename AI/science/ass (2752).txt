Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, with ongoing research refining our understanding of the diverse pathways leading to these enigmatic objects.  The classical model posits stellar-mass black holes forming from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit, a process now supported by gravitational wave observations from merging binary black holes. These detections provide invaluable data on black hole masses and spins, corroborating theoretical models and suggesting a higher prevalence of black holes than previously anticipated.  Recent advancements in numerical relativity have significantly improved simulations of the collapse process, accurately modelling the intricacies of stellar structure and the ensuing formation of an event horizon. Furthermore, the discovery and study of intermediate-mass black holes, bridging the gap between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes, challenges simplistic evolutionary narratives and necessitates exploration of alternative formation mechanisms, such as runaway stellar collisions in dense clusters.  The ongoing quest to understand supermassive black hole formation, particularly at early cosmic epochs, remains a significant area of investigation, with theories ranging from direct collapse of massive gas clouds to the merger of numerous smaller black holes.  These recent developments, fueled by improved observational techniques and advanced computational methods, promise a deeper understanding of black hole demographics and their profound impact on galaxy evolution.
