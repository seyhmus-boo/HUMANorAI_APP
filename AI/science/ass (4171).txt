DNA replication, the process of duplicating a cell's genome, is fundamental to life and a critical target for therapeutic intervention.  Recent advancements have significantly refined our understanding of this intricate process.  High-resolution structural biology techniques, including cryo-electron microscopy, have provided unprecedented detail of replisome architecture and dynamics, revealing the interplay between various replication proteins and their conformational changes during DNA unwinding, primer synthesis, and polymerase action.  Furthermore, single-molecule studies are elucidating the complexities of replication fork progression, including the mechanisms of fork stalling and restart in response to various types of DNA damage.  The role of accessory proteins in maintaining replication fidelity and coordinating leading and lagging strand synthesis is also under intense scrutiny.  These studies, coupled with advances in genome editing technologies, enable more precise investigations into the consequences of replication errors and their contributions to genomic instability and disease.  Emerging research focuses on the intricate connections between DNA replication and other cellular processes, such as transcription and repair, to gain a holistic perspective on genome maintenance and its dysregulation in cancer and aging.
