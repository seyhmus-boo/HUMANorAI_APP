Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked regardless of spatial separation, presents profound implications for quantum computing and communication.  However, realizing its full potential remains significantly hampered by experimental challenges.  Maintaining entanglement over extended periods is a major hurdle, as decoherence – the interaction of entangled particles with their environment – rapidly destroys the delicate quantum correlations.  The scalability of entanglement generation also presents difficulties.  Current methods, such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, are often inefficient, producing low entanglement rates and requiring significant resource investment.  Furthermore, accurate characterization and verification of entangled states are non-trivial, demanding sophisticated quantum tomography techniques that themselves are prone to error and limited by experimental imperfections.  The fragility of entangled states necessitates highly controlled environments, including cryogenic temperatures and ultra-high vacuum conditions, adding to the technological complexity and cost.  Overcoming these obstacles requires significant advancements in materials science, experimental control, and quantum error correction, ultimately paving the way for practical applications of this uniquely quantum phenomenon.
