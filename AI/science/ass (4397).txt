Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential across diverse technological applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges in characterizing and manipulating these unique nanomaterials. This presentation will address key experimental difficulties encountered in the study of CNT properties.  Precise control over CNT chirality and diameter distribution during synthesis remains a major hurdle, hindering reproducible characterization and impacting property variations.  Furthermore, the inherent tendency of CNTs to aggregate presents challenges for dispersion and accurate measurement of individual nanotube properties, particularly in mechanical testing and electrical transport studies.  Advanced characterization techniques, such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy, are crucial but often struggle to provide complete and reliable data due to sample preparation difficulties and interpretation ambiguities.  Finally, the development of scalable and cost-effective purification and functionalization methods to tailor CNT properties for specific applications continues to be a critical experimental limitation.  This presentation will discuss these challenges and highlight ongoing research aimed at overcoming these obstacles for the widespread adoption of CNTs in advanced technologies.
