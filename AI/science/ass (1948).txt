Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms, have captivated researchers across numerous disciplines since their discovery.  Their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, arising from their unique atomic arrangement and high aspect ratio, have spurred intense investigation into their potential applications. This research paper explores the multifaceted properties of CNTs, emphasizing the crucial interdisciplinary nature of their study. We will examine the interplay between physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering in understanding and harnessing the remarkable characteristics of CNTs.  The exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, exceeding those of steel, are crucial for advancements in materials science, particularly in the development of high-strength composites.  Furthermore, their electrical conductivity, which can be tuned from metallic to semiconducting depending on their chirality, makes them vital components in electronics and sensor technologies.  Their high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of many conventional materials, is attractive for thermal management applications.  By examining the synthesis, characterization, and application of CNTs across these varied fields, we aim to highlight the collaborative efforts required to fully unlock the potential of this remarkable material and its contribution to diverse technological advancements.
