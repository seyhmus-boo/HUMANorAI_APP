Catalysts have played a pivotal role in the development of organic chemistry, accelerating reaction rates and enabling the synthesis of countless molecules otherwise inaccessible through conventional methods.  Early examples, albeit often unknowingly employed, include the use of acidic or basic substances to facilitate reactions long before a comprehensive understanding of catalysis emerged.  The 19th century witnessed the gradual elucidation of catalytic phenomena, with researchers like Berzelius recognizing the unique ability of certain substances to influence reaction speed without being consumed themselves.  This led to the conceptualization of catalysis as a distinct chemical phenomenon.  The 20th century saw an explosion in the application of catalysts, particularly in industrial processes, driven by the discovery and development of heterogeneous catalysts like zeolites and homogeneous catalysts based on transition metal complexes.  These advancements profoundly impacted the production of pharmaceuticals, polymers, and fine chemicals. Modern organic chemistry relies heavily on catalysts, not only to increase efficiency but also to achieve greater selectivity, favouring the formation of desired products while minimizing unwanted byproducts.  This selective catalysis is crucial for sustainable and environmentally friendly chemical synthesis, a key focus of contemporary research.
