Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a topic rich in theoretical understanding but fraught with experimental challenges.  While gravitational collapse is the predicted mechanism, directly observing this process is currently impossible given the extreme spacetime curvatures and energy densities involved.  This presentation will examine the key experimental hurdles in verifying theoretical models of black hole formation, focusing on three major areas. First, the limitations of electromagnetic observations in piercing the event horizon and resolving the crucial pre-collapse stages will be discussed. Secondly, the challenges of detecting gravitational waves from stellar-mass black hole formation, including signal-to-noise ratios and the need for advanced detector technology, will be explored. Finally, the potential of multi-messenger astronomy, combining gravitational wave and electromagnetic data, will be assessed, acknowledging the inherent difficulties in correlating events across vastly different wavelengths and timescales.  Overcoming these experimental limitations requires significant advancements in detector sensitivity, data analysis techniques, and theoretical modeling, paving the way for a deeper understanding of black hole formation and the evolution of the universe.
