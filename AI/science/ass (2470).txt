Photosynthesis, the cornerstone of global carbon cycling and biomass production, remains a complex process with significant mechanistic unknowns.  While significant progress has been made in understanding its individual stages – light harvesting, electron transport, and carbon fixation – elucidating the intricate interplay between these components under diverse environmental conditions presents formidable experimental challenges. This presentation will focus on key limitations in current methodologies used to study photosynthesis.  We will discuss the challenges associated with resolving the spatiotemporal dynamics of energy transfer within photosynthetic complexes, highlighting the limitations of current spectroscopic techniques and the need for improved resolution.  Furthermore, we will address the difficulty in decoupling the effects of various environmental stressors (e.g., drought, high light, nutrient deficiency) on individual photosynthetic processes, arguing for a more integrated systems-biology approach.  Finally, the difficulties in translating laboratory-based findings to natural environments, particularly in the context of diverse plant species and varying environmental conditions, will be emphasized.  Overcoming these experimental hurdles requires the development of novel approaches integrating advanced imaging techniques, sophisticated modelling strategies, and improved field-based methodologies for accurately assessing photosynthetic performance in situ.
