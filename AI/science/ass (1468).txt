Plasma physics phenomena, while often treated classically, exhibit significant quantum mechanical effects, particularly at high densities or low temperatures.  Quantum effects fundamentally alter particle interactions and collective behaviour, leading to deviations from classical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) descriptions.  A crucial aspect is quantum degeneracy, where Pauli exclusion principle dictates particle distributions, notably in dense plasmas like those found in white dwarf stars or inertial confinement fusion experiments.  This leads to Fermi pressure, resisting gravitational collapse and influencing plasma stability.  Quantum effects also manifest in the modification of collisional processes.  Quantum mechanical scattering cross-sections replace classical ones, altering transport coefficients such as resistivity and thermal conductivity.  Furthermore, the discrete energy levels of atoms and ions in a plasma influence radiative processes, particularly line broadening and spectral features, offering diagnostic tools for plasma parameters.  Strong coupling effects, where the Coulomb potential energy exceeds the kinetic energy, necessitate a quantum statistical mechanical treatment, revealing correlations and collective excitations not captured by classical models.  Investigating these quantum aspects is crucial for understanding extreme plasma environments and developing advanced plasma technologies.
