Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure.  Their high aspect ratio and strong covalent bonding result in exceptional tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel and comparable to diamond.  This exceptional mechanical strength is complemented by remarkable electrical conductivity, with single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) demonstrating metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality.  This tunable electronic property, along with high thermal conductivity, makes them attractive for applications in electronics and thermal management.  Furthermore, CNTs possess a large surface area, facilitating adsorption and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT synthesis, achieving consistent quality, and overcoming difficulties in processing and dispersion due to strong van der Waals interactions between individual nanotubes.  Future research focusing on scalable and controlled synthesis, along with effective functionalization strategies, will be crucial for realizing the full potential of CNTs across various technological domains.
