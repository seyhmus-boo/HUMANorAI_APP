Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding a synergistic approach integrating diverse fields. This presentation will explore the multifaceted pathways leading to black hole genesis, emphasizing the crucial interdisciplinary links involved.  We will examine the stellar-mass black hole formation paradigm, highlighting the interplay between stellar evolution models (nuclear astrophysics) and sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations (computational astrophysics) to predict remnant properties following supernova explosions.  The formation of supermassive black holes remains a significant puzzle; we will discuss the contributions of both direct collapse scenarios in primordial gas clouds (cosmology) and the crucial role of mergers and accretion (galactic dynamics) in their growth.  Furthermore, the importance of gravitational wave astronomy (general relativity) in confirming theoretical predictions and revealing the dynamics of binary black hole mergers will be emphasized.  By showcasing the interconnectedness of these disciplines, the presentation aims to underscore the necessity of interdisciplinary collaborations to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of black hole formation across cosmic scales.  Future research directions and potential avenues for cross-disciplinary synergy will also be highlighted.
