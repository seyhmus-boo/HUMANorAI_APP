Black hole formation, a pivotal process in astrophysics, hinges on the interplay of gravity and stellar evolution.  Analogously, imagine a trampoline representing spacetime. Placing a bowling ball (a massive star) creates a significant dip; this represents the star's gravitational field.  As the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its internal pressure decreases, unable to counteract gravity's relentless inward pull.  This is akin to removing supports from beneath the trampoline; the bowling ball sinks deeper.  For sufficiently massive stars (greater than roughly 20 solar masses), this collapse is unremitting.  

The star's core implodes, its density increasing to an unimaginable degree, exceeding even that of atomic nuclei.  This phase is analogous to compressing the bowling ball into an infinitely small point â€“ a singularity.  The immense gravitational pull at this singularity prevents even light from escaping, creating the event horizon, a boundary beyond which no information can be retrieved.  Less massive stars (8-20 solar masses) may instead form neutron stars, a stage where the collapse is halted by neutron degeneracy pressure, representing a less extreme dip in the trampoline. The final fate of a star, therefore, is determined by its initial mass, a critical parameter governing the final state of gravitational collapse.
