Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, sharing the same fate regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation surpasses classical physics, exhibiting stronger-than-classical correlations between observable properties, even at macroscopic distances.  The conceptual groundwork was laid by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in their 1935 paradox, which highlighted the seemingly paradoxical non-locality inherent in quantum entanglement.  They argued this violated locality and realism, proposing hidden variables as a solution.

However, John Bell's theorem (1964) mathematically demonstrated that no local realistic theory could reproduce all predictions of quantum mechanics, thereby setting the stage for experimental verification.  Numerous experiments, beginning in the late 20th century and continuing to this day, have consistently violated Bell inequalities, validating the existence of entanglement and its non-local nature.  These experiments, utilising entangled photons or ions, have conclusively shown that quantum correlations exist, prompting ongoing research into potential applications, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation. Despite its experimental confirmation, the fundamental interpretation of entanglement remains a subject of ongoing debate and theoretical investigation.
