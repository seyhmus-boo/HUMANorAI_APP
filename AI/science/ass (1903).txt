Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally explained by quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of atomic orbitals, governed by the Schrödinger equation.  When atoms approach, their atomic orbitals overlap, leading to a decrease in the overall energy of the system. This stabilization is a consequence of the constructive interference of wavefunctions, creating bonding molecular orbitals that are lower in energy than the constituent atomic orbitals.  Electrons occupy these bonding orbitals, resulting in the attractive force that constitutes a chemical bond.

The spatial arrangement of atoms within a molecule—its structure—is directly determined by the spatial distribution of these bonding electrons.  Repulsion between electron pairs, both bonding and non-bonding (lone pairs),  influences the bond angles and overall geometry.  Molecular orbital theory, a sophisticated application of quantum mechanics, predicts the shape and properties of molecules by considering the linear combination of atomic orbitals to form bonding, antibonding, and non-bonding molecular orbitals.  The occupancy of these orbitals dictates the molecule's electronic configuration and consequently its structure and reactivity.  Hybridisation of atomic orbitals is often invoked to rationalise observed molecular geometries.
