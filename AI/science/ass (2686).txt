Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon initially predicted by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in their 1935 paradox, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation persists even when the systems are spatially separated, defying classical notions of locality.  The EPR paper aimed to demonstrate the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, arguing that hidden variables must exist to explain such seemingly instantaneous interactions.  However, Bell's theorem (1964) provided a rigorous framework to experimentally test the predictions of quantum mechanics against local hidden variable theories.

Subsequent experiments, notably those conducted by Alain Aspect in the 1980s, overwhelmingly confirmed quantum mechanical predictions, violating Bell inequalities and demonstrating the reality of entanglement. This signifies that the entangled systems' properties are not pre-determined but rather become correlated upon measurement.  Entanglement's implications are profound, extending beyond fundamental physics. It forms the basis for emerging quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum cryptography, where entangled qubits are exploited for enhanced computational power and secure communication.  Despite its experimental verification, the fundamental nature of entanglement and its precise interpretation remain subjects of ongoing research and debate.
