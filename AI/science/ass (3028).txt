Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, positioning them as a cornerstone material across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines. This presentation explores the key properties of CNTs, highlighting their interdisciplinary applications.  Their extraordinary tensile strength and elasticity, exceeding that of steel, are crucial in materials science for developing high-performance composites and advanced nanomaterials.  Simultaneously, their unique electronic structure, allowing for metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on chirality, underpins their use in electronics, from next-generation transistors to flexible displays.  Furthermore, the high thermal conductivity of CNTs finds application in thermal management systems, addressing critical issues in microelectronics and energy storage.  We will examine the interdisciplinary connections between these properties, demonstrating how their combined strengths are leveraged in fields ranging from biomedical engineering (drug delivery, biosensors) and environmental science (water purification, remediation) to energy (batteries, fuel cells).  The presentation will conclude by discussing current challenges and future directions in CNT research, emphasizing the synergistic potential of interdisciplinary collaborations to fully realize the transformative potential of this remarkable material.
