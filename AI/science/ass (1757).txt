Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized structure.  Their high aspect ratio yields extraordinary mechanical strength, with tensile strengths exceeding that of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality and diameter, exhibiting high electron mobility.  Their thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, surpassing that of many metals.  These properties are significantly influenced by factors such as tube diameter, length, chirality, and degree of functionalization.

The exceptional properties of CNTs translate to a wide array of practical applications.  Their high strength-to-weight ratio makes them attractive for reinforcing composite materials in aerospace and automotive industries.  Their electrical conductivity facilitates their use in electronics, including transistors, sensors, and conductive inks.  High thermal conductivity enables applications in thermal management systems and heat dissipation technologies.  Furthermore, their large surface area finds application in energy storage devices (e.g., supercapacitors) and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in scalable and cost-effective production and processing methods, as well as addressing potential toxicity concerns, to fully realize their widespread technological impact.
