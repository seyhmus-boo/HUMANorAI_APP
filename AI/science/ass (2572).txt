Black hole formation remains a captivating frontier in astrophysics, bridging stellar evolution with the most extreme environments in the Universe.  This presentation will summarize our current understanding of this process, focusing on recent advancements in observational and theoretical astrophysics.  While the collapse of sufficiently massive stars is the established pathway for stellar-mass black holes, recent gravitational wave detections from LIGO/Virgo have refined our knowledge of the merger rate and progenitor characteristics, revealing a surprisingly diverse population.  We will discuss ongoing efforts to model these events accurately, including improved treatments of stellar evolution, supernova physics, and the subsequent black hole recoil.  Furthermore, the formation of supermassive black holes, residing at the centers of galaxies, remains a significant puzzle.  We will explore competing theories, such as direct collapse from primordial gas clouds and the hierarchical merging of smaller black holes, considering recent observations from high-redshift quasars and improved simulations that incorporate feedback processes.  Finally, we will highlight promising future research directions, including multi-messenger astronomy combining gravitational wave and electromagnetic observations, and the potential for advanced numerical simulations to shed further light on these fundamental astrophysical processes.
