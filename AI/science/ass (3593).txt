DNA replication is a semiconservative process crucial for cellular proliferation and inheritance.  It involves the precise duplication of the double-stranded DNA helix, ensuring each daughter cell receives an identical copy of the genome.  Initiation occurs at specific origins of replication, where the DNA unwinds, forming a replication fork.  Helicases catalyze this unwinding, while single-stranded binding proteins prevent re-annealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate synthesis of leading and lagging strands.  The lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments, which are later joined by DNA ligase.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase I and III.  Telomerase addresses the end replication problem in eukaryotes.  Errors in replication can lead to mutations, contributing to diseases like cancer.  

Practical applications of our understanding of DNA replication are extensive.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology exploits the principles of DNA replication to amplify specific DNA sequences, crucial for diagnostics, forensics, and genetic engineering.  Antiviral drugs target viral DNA polymerases, inhibiting viral replication.  Furthermore, research into DNA replication mechanisms informs our understanding of cancer development and aids in the development of novel cancer therapies targeting replication processes.  The field continues to evolve, with ongoing investigation into the intricate regulation and potential therapeutic manipulation of this fundamental biological process.
