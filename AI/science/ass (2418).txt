Black hole formation represents a critical endpoint in stellar evolution, primarily driven by gravitational collapse.  Massive stars, exceeding approximately 20 solar masses, exhaust their nuclear fuel, culminating in the cessation of fusion reactions.  The subsequent loss of outward radiation pressure against the immense inward gravitational force initiates a catastrophic implosion.  This process, characterized by rapidly increasing density and temperature, overcomes electron degeneracy pressure, leading to the formation of a singularity at the core.  Depending on the star's initial mass and angular momentum, this collapse may result in either a stellar-mass black hole, typically ranging from a few to tens of solar masses, or a hypernova event potentially leading to the formation of a more massive black hole or a neutron star.  Supermassive black holes, residing at the centers of galaxies, are believed to form through a combination of mechanisms, including the accretion of surrounding matter and the merging of smaller black holes.  These processes, while complex and not fully understood, underscore the fundamental role of gravity in shaping the large-scale structure of the universe and the ultimate fate of stars. Ongoing research utilizing gravitational wave detection and advanced numerical simulations continues to refine our understanding of black hole formation across the mass spectrum.
