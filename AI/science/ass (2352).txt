Nuclear fission is the process whereby a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the process. This energy release stems from the mass defect—a slight difference in mass between the original nucleus and the resulting fission fragments—which is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².  The fission reaction is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the nucleus to become unstable and undergo fission.  This process also releases further neutrons, leading to a chain reaction if sufficient fissile material is present.  The controlled chain reaction is the basis of nuclear power generation, where the heat generated from fission is used to produce steam, driving turbines and generating electricity.  Uncontrolled chain reactions, as in nuclear weapons, result in a rapid and devastating release of energy.  The byproducts of fission are highly radioactive fission products, requiring careful management and long-term storage due to their extended decay periods.  Furthermore, the neutrons released during fission can be used for research and medical applications, including neutron activation analysis and radiotherapy.
