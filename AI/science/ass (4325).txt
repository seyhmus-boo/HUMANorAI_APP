Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, providing a powerful and precise tool for genome editing.  Historically, genome modification relied on laborious and often imprecise methods such as zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs). These techniques, while groundbreaking in their time, suffered from limitations in design complexity, cost, and off-target effects. The discovery of CRISPR-Cas systems, initially identified as a bacterial adaptive immune mechanism against bacteriophages, offered a transformative alternative.  This prokaryotic system, characterized by CRISPR arrays and Cas nucleases, leverages guide RNA (gRNA) for targeted DNA recognition and cleavage, enabling highly specific gene editing.  Since its adaptation for eukaryotic genome manipulation in the early 2010s, CRISPR-Cas has rapidly become the dominant gene editing technology across diverse research fields.  This paper will explore the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas systems, focusing specifically on the most commonly used Cas9 enzyme, and critically evaluate its applications, limitations, and ethical considerations in the context of genetic engineering.  We will also discuss emerging advancements aiming to improve specificity, expand targeting capabilities, and broaden the therapeutic potential of this transformative technology.
