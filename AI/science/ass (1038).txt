Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating phenomenon of quantum entanglement.  From a quantum mechanical perspective, entanglement arises when two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of spatial separation.  This interconnectedness is described by a joint wavefunction that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each system.  Crucially, measuring a property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the corresponding property of the other, even across vast distances.

This seemingly paradoxical behaviour violates classical intuition, where locality dictates that an action in one location cannot instantaneously affect a distant location.  Einstein famously referred to this as "spooky action at a distance." However, entanglement is a well-established prediction and experimental observation of quantum mechanics. The correlation observed between entangled particles exceeds any classical correlation possible, exceeding even Bell's inequalities, demonstrating the non-locality inherent in quantum mechanics. This non-classical correlation forms the basis for numerous applications in quantum information science, including quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
