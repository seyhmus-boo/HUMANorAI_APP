CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient method for genome editing. This presentation will provide a concise overview of CRISPR's mechanism of action, highlighting its advantages over previous gene editing technologies.  We will explore the versatility of CRISPR, encompassing its application in both gene knockouts and knockins, as well as base editing and prime editing, allowing for a wider array of genetic modifications.  The practical applications of CRISPR technology are vast and rapidly expanding.  This presentation will focus on key areas, including advancements in disease modeling and therapy, notably in gene therapy for inherited disorders like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anemia.  Furthermore, we will discuss its impact on agricultural biotechnology, such as enhancing crop yields and disease resistance.  The ethical considerations surrounding CRISPR technology, including off-target effects and potential misuse, will also be briefly addressed.  Finally, we will examine emerging trends and future directions for CRISPR-based research and its translational potential towards improving human and environmental health.
