Good morning. Today's lecture concerns plasma physics phenomena, a field burgeoning from the late 19th-century study of gaseous discharges.  Early observations, such as Crookes’ dark space and Faraday’s experiments with electric arcs, laid the groundwork for understanding ionized gases – plasmas.  Crucially, Langmuir's work in the 1920s coined the term "plasma" and established its unique properties: collective behaviour governed by long-range Coulomb interactions.

Plasma phenomena are incredibly diverse.  We observe them in everyday occurrences like lightning, fluorescent lights, and even the aurora borealis.  However, the field extends far beyond terrestrial examples.  Stellar interiors, the solar wind, and interstellar media are all predominantly plasma.  The study of plasma physics encompasses a wide range of fascinating phenomena, including plasma waves, instabilities, magnetic confinement, and fusion reactions.  Understanding these phenomena is crucial to advancements in areas such as controlled thermonuclear fusion, space exploration, and materials science.
