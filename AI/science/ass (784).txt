Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, have garnered significant attention for diverse technological applications.  This presentation will explore the fundamental quantum mechanical underpinnings of these remarkable properties. We will examine the electronic structure of CNTs, focusing on the role of Ï€-electron delocalization and the resulting band structure, which dictates their metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on chirality.  The influence of quantum confinement effects on the electronic and optical properties will be discussed, highlighting the size- and chirality-dependent band gaps and energy levels.  Furthermore, we will investigate the vibrational modes of CNTs, emphasizing the role of phonon dispersion relations in their exceptional thermal conductivity.  A brief overview of theoretical approaches, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and tight-binding calculations, used to model and predict these properties will be presented.  Finally, we will touch upon ongoing challenges in the theoretical understanding of CNTs, including accurate modeling of defects and interactions with their environment, crucial for optimizing their performance in real-world applications.  The aim is to provide a concise yet comprehensive quantum mechanical perspective on the intriguing and versatile properties of these nanoscale materials.
