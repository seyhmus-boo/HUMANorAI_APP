Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, possess a unique combination of properties rendering them attractive for diverse applications.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from strong sp² hybridized carbon bonds, results in high tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel.  Remarkably high electrical conductivity, comparable to copper, arises from their delocalized π-electron system, further enhanced in single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs).  Depending on chirality, CNTs can exhibit either metallic or semiconducting behaviour, enabling their use in electronics.  Furthermore, their high aspect ratio and large surface area contribute to superior thermal conductivity and adsorption capabilities.

These remarkable properties translate into a wide array of practical applications.  In materials science, CNTs are employed as reinforcing agents in composites, enhancing strength and stiffness.  Their electrical conductivity facilitates their use in transparent conducting films, electrodes for energy storage devices (e.g., batteries and supercapacitors), and field-effect transistors.  The high surface area finds application in catalysis and filtration.  However, challenges remain, including cost-effective large-scale production, controlling chirality for specific applications, and addressing potential toxicity concerns.  Despite these hurdles, ongoing research continues to unlock the full potential of CNTs across numerous technological domains.
