DNA replication, a fundamental process in all life, remains a subject of intense investigation despite decades of research.  This presentation will address significant experimental challenges inherent in studying this intricate molecular machinery.  High-fidelity replication requires precise coordination of numerous proteins, operating at remarkable speed and accuracy.  Traditional biochemical approaches, while providing crucial insights, struggle to capture the dynamic interplay of these factors *in vivo*.  Visualizing replication forks at the single-molecule level remains a significant hurdle, requiring sophisticated microscopy techniques and innovative sample preparation methods to overcome limitations imposed by spatial and temporal resolution.  Furthermore, studying replication in diverse organisms, particularly those with complex genomes or unusual replication strategies, presents unique methodological difficulties.  We will explore current advancements in single-molecule techniques, such as super-resolution microscopy and nanopore sequencing, highlighting their potential to address longstanding challenges.  Finally, the presentation will discuss emerging computational approaches for modelling and interpreting increasingly large datasets generated by these methods, ultimately aiming to build a more complete and accurate understanding of DNA replication's dynamic complexity.
