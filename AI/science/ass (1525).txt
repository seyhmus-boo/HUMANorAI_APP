Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, exhibit a unique combination of mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their distinctive cylindrical nanostructure.  Their exceptional tensile strength, exceeding that of steel at a significantly lower density, makes them promising candidates for high-strength composite materials.  The electrical properties of CNTs are highly dependent on their chirality – the arrangement of carbon atoms within the hexagonal lattice – with armchair nanotubes displaying metallic conductivity and zigzag or chiral nanotubes exhibiting semiconducting behavior. This tunable conductivity underpins their potential in electronics and sensor applications.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptionally high thermal conductivity, far surpassing that of copper, facilitating efficient heat dissipation in electronic devices and other applications.  These remarkable characteristics, however, are often accompanied by challenges related to dispersion and functionalization, which necessitate the development of advanced techniques for processing and manipulating CNTs to fully exploit their potential in diverse technological fields.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these limitations and further refining our understanding of the structure-property relationships in CNTs.
