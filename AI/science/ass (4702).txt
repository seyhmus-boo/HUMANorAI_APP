Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, is theoretically understood through the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses under its own gravity. If the core mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), even neutron degeneracy pressure cannot withstand the immense gravitational pull, leading to the formation of a singularity and an event horizon, defining a black hole.  This process is further complicated by factors like stellar rotation and magnetic fields, influencing the resulting black hole properties.

Experimentally verifying these processes presents considerable challenges. Direct observation of the collapse itself is impossible due to the opacity of the collapsing stellar core and the event horizon's inherent light-trapping nature.  Instead, we rely on indirect evidence, such as gravitational wave detection from merging black holes (providing information about their masses and spins) and observations of the accretion disks surrounding supermassive black holes, which indirectly reveal their presence through X-ray emissions.  Furthermore, accurately modelling the complex physics governing stellar collapse requires computationally intensive simulations, whose results remain dependent on uncertain input parameters like the equation of state for dense matter.  Hence, robust experimental validation of black hole formation models remains a significant frontier in astrophysical research.
