Understanding chemical bonding and molecular structure presents significant experimental challenges, particularly at the level of individual molecules.  Direct observation of bond lengths and angles necessitates techniques with sub-angstrom resolution, such as X-ray crystallography or electron diffraction.  However, these methods often require crystalline samples, limiting their applicability to amorphous or gaseous phases.  Furthermore, crystal packing forces can subtly influence bond parameters, necessitating careful interpretation of data and potentially the use of computational methods for correction.  Spectroscopic techniques, including NMR and IR spectroscopy, provide indirect evidence of bonding and structure, but spectral interpretation can be complex, particularly for large or asymmetric molecules.  The assignment of spectral peaks to specific bonds or functional groups often requires sophisticated computational modelling to support experimental data.  Moreover, the dynamic nature of many molecules presents a challenge;  techniques need to resolve both static structure and conformational changes over time, often requiring the combination of multiple experimental and theoretical approaches.  The accurate determination of molecular structure therefore demands a multifaceted strategy, integrating diverse experimental data and sophisticated computational analysis to overcome these inherent limitations.
