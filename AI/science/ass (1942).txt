Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, constitutes a pivotal process in nuclear energy generation and weaponry.  This lecture will explore the fundamental mechanics driving fission, focusing on the role of neutron bombardment in initiating the process.  We will examine the critical mass concept, highlighting the necessary quantity of fissile material required to sustain a chain reaction.  Furthermore, the lecture will delve into the energy release mechanism, explaining the mass-energy equivalence encapsulated in Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ², and how this translates to the immense energy yield observed in fission reactions.  Finally,  a comparative analysis of different fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, will be presented, emphasizing their relative fissile properties and implications for reactor design and nuclear weapon development.  The inherent dangers associated with uncontrolled chain reactions and the generation of radioactive byproducts will also be addressed.
