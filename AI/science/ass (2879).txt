Black hole formation represents a critical endpoint in stellar evolution, dictated by the interplay between stellar mass and internal pressure.  This abstract explores the theoretical pathways leading to black hole genesis.  For stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses, the exhaustion of nuclear fuel results in core collapse.  The immense gravitational pressure overcomes degeneracy pressure, initiating a catastrophic inward collapse.  If the remnant core mass surpasses the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, even neutron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to halt the contraction.  This runaway collapse proceeds until a singularity forms, surrounded by an event horizon defining the black hole.  Less massive stars (8-20 solar masses) may undergo Type II supernovae, potentially leaving behind neutron stars; however, if sufficient mass remains after the explosion, or if accretion from a binary companion occurs, the resulting object may exceed the threshold for black hole formation.  Furthermore, supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, likely originate through mechanisms involving seed black holes and subsequent accretion of surrounding matter, although the precise formation pathways remain an area of active research.
