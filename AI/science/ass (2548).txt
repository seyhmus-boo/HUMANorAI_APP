Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.  These properties render them attractive for diverse applications.  Their high aspect ratio leads to exceptionally high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel by orders of magnitude.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality (the angle of the hexagonal lattice's roll-up).  This tunable conductivity is crucial for nanoelectronic applications.

Thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high along the tube axis, promising advancements in thermal management.  Their large surface area-to-volume ratio contributes to significant adsorption capabilities, useful in catalysis and gas storage.  However, challenges remain in controlling their precise chirality and achieving large-scale, cost-effective production of uniform CNTs.  Despite these challenges, ongoing research continues to unlock the potential of CNTs across a broad spectrum of fields, from composites and energy storage to sensors and biomedical devices.
