Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with unique cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties driving interdisciplinary research across materials science, engineering, and biomedical fields.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds,  makes them ideal for reinforcing composites, leading to advancements in lightweight, high-strength materials for aerospace and automotive applications.  Their remarkable electrical conductivity, tunable between metallic and semiconducting behavior depending on chirality, fuels development in nanoelectronics, including transistors and sensors.  Furthermore, their high surface area facilitates applications in energy storage (e.g., supercapacitors and batteries), catalysis, and environmental remediation through adsorption.

The biocompatibility of CNTs, albeit context-dependent and requiring surface functionalization for optimal results, opens avenues in drug delivery and biosensing.  Interdisciplinary collaborations are crucial to overcome challenges such as efficient CNT synthesis, dispersion, and toxicity concerns, integrating expertise in chemistry (functionalization), physics (electronic properties), biology (biocompatibility), and engineering (device fabrication).  Ongoing research focuses on harnessing CNTs' multi-faceted properties to create innovative solutions across diverse sectors, requiring continued interdisciplinary synergy.
