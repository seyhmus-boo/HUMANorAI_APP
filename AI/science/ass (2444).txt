Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the interplay of the strong nuclear force, a short-range attractive force between nucleons, and the Coulomb repulsion between protons.  Quantum tunneling plays a crucial role; the probability of a nucleus overcoming the potential barrier separating it from a fissioned state is non-zero, even if the kinetic energy is insufficient classically.  This tunneling probability is calculated using quantum mechanical methods, often employing approximations like the WKB approximation.  The wave function describing the nuclear system encompasses a superposition of bound and unbound states, the latter representing fission fragments.  The shape and evolution of this wave function, influenced by the nuclear potential energy landscape and nucleon-nucleon interactions, dictate the fission dynamics, including fragment mass distributions and kinetic energies.  Furthermore, the emission of neutrons, a characteristic of fission, is a consequence of the quantum mechanical nature of the strong force and the energy distribution amongst the fragments, leading to neutron emission from excited states.  Understanding these processes necessitates sophisticated quantum many-body techniques, often relying on numerical simulations and theoretical models to account for the complexity of the nuclear interaction.
