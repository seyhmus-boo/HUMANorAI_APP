Good morning. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding approximately three times the Sun's mass.  Following core collapse supernovae, if sufficient mass remains after the explosion,  unstoppable inward gravitational pull ensues, overcoming all other forces, resulting in a singularity.

Recent advancements in gravitational wave astronomy, via detectors such as LIGO and Virgo, have revolutionised our understanding.  The detection of binary black hole mergers provides direct observational evidence of their existence and the dynamics of their formation, often involving interactions within dense stellar clusters.  Furthermore,  refined simulations using advanced numerical techniques are increasingly accurately modelling the complex hydrodynamics of supernovae and the subsequent black hole formation process, allowing for a better understanding of the mass range and spin distribution of resulting black holes.  These combined approaches, bridging theoretical modelling with observational data, are continually refining our picture of this fascinating astrophysical phenomenon.
