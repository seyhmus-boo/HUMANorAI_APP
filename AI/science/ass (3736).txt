DNA replication, the process by which genetic material is duplicated, is fundamental to life.  This presentation will provide an overview of the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying this crucial process, focusing on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic systems. We will begin by exploring the essential components: DNA polymerases, helicases, primases, and topoisomerases, and their coordinated actions in unwinding the parental DNA duplex, synthesizing the leading and lagging strands, and resolving replication-associated topological stress.  The challenges posed by the antiparallel nature of DNA strands, including Okazaki fragment processing, will be discussed.  Furthermore, we will examine the fidelity mechanisms ensuring accurate DNA replication, encompassing proofreading activity of polymerases and post-replicative repair pathways.  Differences in replication strategies between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, such as the presence of multiple origins of replication in eukaryotes and the involvement of specialized replication factors, will be highlighted.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the implications of replication errors in genome instability and disease, emphasizing the importance of understanding this fundamental biological process.
