Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical macromolecules composed entirely of carbon atoms, have garnered significant attention since their discovery in 1991 by Iijima.  This groundbreaking discovery, initially observed in the soot produced by arc-discharge evaporation of graphite, unveiled a novel material with exceptional properties promising revolutionary advancements across diverse scientific and technological fields.  Early research focused primarily on establishing the fundamental structure and morphology of CNTs, differentiating between single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).  Subsequent investigation revealed a unique combination of mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics that surpass those of many conventional materials.  This paper delves into the comprehensive exploration of these properties, examining their dependence on factors such as chirality, diameter, and structural defects.  We will analyze the exceptional tensile strength and elasticity of CNTs, their remarkable electrical conductivity ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, and their superior thermal conductivity.  Furthermore, we will discuss the challenges and ongoing research efforts focused on the controlled synthesis, functionalization, and large-scale production of CNTs necessary for realizing their full technological potential in diverse applications, including advanced composites, electronics, and energy storage.
