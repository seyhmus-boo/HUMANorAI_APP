Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating phenomenon of black hole formation.  Imagine a massive star, a celestial body many times larger than our sun, nearing the end of its life.  Its nuclear furnace, responsible for combating gravitational collapse, has exhausted its fuel.  This is analogous to a giant balloon slowly deflating; the internal pressure supporting its structure diminishes.

The star's immense gravity, previously counterbalanced by outward pressure, now takes over.  The core implodes catastrophically.  Think of it as a sudden, violent collapse of a building after its supporting pillars fail.  This implosion compresses the stellar material into an incredibly dense singularity, a point of infinite density.  The surrounding space is warped so severely that even light cannot escape its gravitational grip â€“ hence the term "black hole."  The process can culminate in a spectacular supernova, the explosive death throes of the star, scattering its outer layers into the cosmos while the core collapses into the black hole.  Different initial stellar masses dictate the black hole's final size, creating a spectrum of these enigmatic objects within our universe.
