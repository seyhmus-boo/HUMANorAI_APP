Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns the intricate mechanisms of photosynthesis.  Essentially, plants are solar-powered factories, converting light energy into chemical energy stored as sugars. This process unfolds in two main phases: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle.

Think of the light-dependent reactions as the power generation phase.  Chlorophyll, analogous to solar panels, captures light energy, exciting electrons to a higher energy level.  This energy is then used to split water molecules, releasing oxygen – a byproduct, like waste heat from a power plant.  The high-energy electrons are then shuttled through an electron transport chain, analogous to a hydroelectric dam's turbines, generating ATP and NADPH – the energy currency of the cell.

The light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, are the assembly line.  Here, the ATP and NADPH, our energy currency, power the fixation of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, analogous to raw materials entering a factory.  Through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, this carbon dioxide is converted into glucose, the final product – our finished goods – representing stored chemical energy.  This glucose then fuels the plant’s growth and metabolism.
