Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of sp²-hybridized carbon atoms, were first observed in 1991 by Iijima, marking a pivotal moment in nanotechnology.  Their unique structural properties, stemming from their seamless graphitic sheets rolled into cylinders, dictate exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  CNTs exhibit extraordinary tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, while possessing remarkable flexibility. Their electrical conductivity varies significantly depending on chirality – armchair nanotubes are metallic, while zigzag and chiral nanotubes display semiconducting behavior, offering potential for advanced electronics.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate exceptionally high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper.  These properties have fueled extensive research into their applications in diverse fields, including composites for enhanced strength and lightweight materials, high-performance transistors, energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors), and biomedical applications such as drug delivery.  However, challenges remain, particularly concerning scalable, cost-effective production and the effective dispersion and functionalization of CNTs for optimal performance in specific applications.  Ongoing research focuses on addressing these challenges to fully realize the potential of this remarkable material.
