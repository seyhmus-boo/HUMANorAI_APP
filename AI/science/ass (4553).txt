Nuclear fission, the splitting of an atomic nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei, represents a pivotal scientific discovery with profound implications for energy production and global security.  Its origins lie in the burgeoning field of nuclear physics in the early 20th century.  Following the discovery of the neutron in 1932 by James Chadwick, experimental investigations into neutron bombardment of various elements rapidly progressed.  Crucially, in 1938, Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, building on the work of Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, conclusively demonstrated the fission of uranium nuclei, a finding that shattered prevailing understanding of atomic structure.  Meitner and Frisch provided the theoretical explanation, recognizing the enormous energy release associated with this process, a consequence of Einstein's mass-energy equivalence. This landmark achievement immediately sparked intense scientific interest, fueled by both the potential for unprecedented energy generation and the ominous possibility of devastating weaponry.  This paper will delve into the fundamental mechanisms of nuclear fission, exploring the various processes involved, including spontaneous fission, induced fission by thermal and fast neutrons, and the intricacies of fission product yields and energy distributions.  Furthermore, it will examine the technological applications and broader societal impacts of this transformative nuclear phenomenon.
