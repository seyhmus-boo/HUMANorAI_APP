Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation transcends classical physics, exhibiting strong correlations that violate Bell's inequalities, thus definitively demonstrating the non-locality inherent in quantum systems.  The entangled particles exist in a superposition state, described by a joint wavefunction that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each particle.  Measurement of a property of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the others, even over vast distances.  This non-classical correlation is not explained by hidden variables, as proven by experimental violations of Bell inequalities.

The theoretical framework relies heavily on the principles of superposition and the tensor product of Hilbert spaces, allowing for a mathematical description of the entangled state's evolution.  While the instantaneous correlation doesn't violate causality (no information can be transmitted faster than light), it highlights the fundamental difference between quantum and classical descriptions of reality. Ongoing research focuses on harnessing entanglement for practical applications, including quantum computing and quantum cryptography, capitalizing on its inherent advantages over classical systems for information processing and secure communication.
