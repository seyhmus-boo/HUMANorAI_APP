Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 through transmission electron microscopy, are cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized structure.  Their morphology, characterized by a seamless graphene sheet rolled into a cylinder, dictates their remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  Mechanically, CNTs exhibit extraordinary tensile strength and elastic modulus, exceeding that of steel by orders of magnitude.  Electrically, they can behave as either metallic conductors or semiconductors, depending on their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's rolling), offering potential for diverse applications in electronics.  Thermally, they possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  

Beyond these fundamental properties, CNTs also display intriguing optical properties, including strong absorption in the near-infrared region.  However, challenges remain in the controlled synthesis and scalable production of high-quality, uniform CNTs with desired chirality and length.  Furthermore, the tendency for aggregation and the difficulty in dispersion in common solvents necessitates further research into functionalization techniques for broader applicability in advanced materials and technologies.
