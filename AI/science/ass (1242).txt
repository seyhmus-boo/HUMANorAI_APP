Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have driven extensive research and development.  Their remarkable tensile strength, exceeding that of steel at a significantly lower density, stems from the strong spÂ² hybridized carbon-carbon bonds forming their hexagonal lattice.  Electrically, CNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials, depending on their chirality and diameter, offering versatility for applications in electronics.  This inherent tunability is being exploited in recent advances, particularly in the development of high-performance transistors and flexible electronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper along their axial direction, making them promising candidates for thermal management applications.  Recent developments focus on improving CNT synthesis techniques for greater control over chirality and diameter distribution, enhancing their scalability and integration into existing technologies.  Research into functionalization strategies, enabling tailored surface chemistry for specific applications, is also progressing rapidly, paving the way for their wider use in diverse fields such as energy storage, biomedical engineering, and composite materials.
