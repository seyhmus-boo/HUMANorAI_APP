Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical physics, where systems are considered independent entities. In entangled states, the composite system's wave function cannot be factored into individual wave functions for each subsystem.  Instead, the state is described by a superposition encompassing all possible combinations of the individual subsystem states.  Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, regardless of spatial separation, a phenomenon seemingly violating locality as described by classical physics.

This instantaneous correlation is not exploitable for faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of the measurement on the individual particle remains probabilistic until observation.  Bell's theorem and subsequent experiments definitively demonstrate the violation of Bell inequalities, confirming the existence of entanglement and refuting local realism. The strength of entanglement is quantified through measures such as concurrence or entanglement entropy, reflecting the degree of correlation between the entangled systems. Understanding and manipulating entanglement are pivotal for advancements in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  Further research continues to explore the fundamental nature of this extraordinary phenomenon and its applications.
