Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized structure and nanoscale dimensions.  Their mechanical properties, including extraordinary tensile strength and Young's modulus exceeding that of steel, are of significant interest to materials science and engineering, enabling applications in high-strength composites and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS).  Their electrical properties are equally remarkable; single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality, a crucial aspect impacting their potential in nanoelectronics and sensor technologies.  Furthermore, their high surface area and aspect ratio are exploited in chemistry and environmental science, facilitating applications in catalysis, energy storage (e.g., supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries), and water purification.  The interdisciplinary nature of CNT research is highlighted by the interplay between physics (electronic structure, mechanical behaviour), chemistry (functionalization, synthesis), and engineering (device fabrication, applications).  Understanding the complex relationship between CNT structure and properties remains a central challenge driving ongoing research.
