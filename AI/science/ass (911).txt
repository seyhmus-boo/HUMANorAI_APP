Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the intricate mechanisms of photosynthesis, a process fundamental to life on Earth.  Early understanding, dating back to the 17th century with van Helmont's willow tree experiment, incorrectly attributed plant growth solely to water intake.  However, subsequent research, notably Priestley's demonstration of oxygen release by plants, and Ingenhousz's clarification of the light-dependency, laid the groundwork for a more complete picture.

The process itself is broadly divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle.  In the light-dependent reactions, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and other pigments within photosystems II and I, driving electron transport chains that generate ATP and NADPH.  Oxygen is a byproduct of water splitting during this phase.  The Calvin cycle then utilizes this ATP and NADPH to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into glucose, a crucial energy storage molecule.  This remarkable process, honed over billions of years, underpins the global carbon cycle and provides the basis of most food webs.  Further research continues to unravel the complexities within these fundamental stages.
