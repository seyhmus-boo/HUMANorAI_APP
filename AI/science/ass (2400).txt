Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon of quantum mechanics, presents immense potential for technological advancements in quantum computing and communication.  However, realizing this potential hinges on overcoming significant experimental challenges. This presentation will address key hurdles in generating, manipulating, and maintaining entangled states, specifically focusing on the fragility of entanglement against decoherence.  We will explore the impact of environmental noise, including thermal fluctuations and stray electromagnetic fields, on the fidelity and coherence time of entangled systems.  Furthermore, scalability remains a significant obstacle; creating and controlling large-scale entangled networks presents formidable technological demands.  The presentation will discuss various approaches to mitigating these challenges, including the use of advanced materials, improved isolation techniques, and novel quantum error correction codes.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the ongoing development of robust and scalable entanglement generation methods, such as those utilizing trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonic systems, highlighting the current state-of-the-art and future directions in this vibrant field.
