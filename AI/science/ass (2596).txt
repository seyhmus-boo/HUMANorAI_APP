Catalysts have fundamentally shaped the trajectory of organic chemistry, enabling reactions otherwise inaccessible under practical conditions.  Historically, their use predates a deep mechanistic understanding.  Early examples include the use of sulfuric acid in esterification, a process employed for centuries without a clear grasp of its catalytic role.  The advent of physical organic chemistry in the 20th century provided a theoretical framework, revealing that catalysts function by lowering the activation energy of a reaction.  This is achieved through the formation of transient intermediate complexes,  stabilizing the transition state and thereby accelerating the rate of reaction without being consumed themselves.

In organic chemistry, catalysts span a broad range, encompassing both homogeneous (e.g., transition metal complexes) and heterogeneous (e.g., zeolites) systems.  Homogeneous catalysts often exhibit higher selectivity due to precise control over the reaction environment, while heterogeneous catalysts offer advantages in terms of ease of separation and reusability. The design and synthesis of new catalysts remain a central theme in contemporary research, driven by the need for more efficient, selective, and sustainable processes in organic synthesis.
