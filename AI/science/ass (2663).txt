Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, remains a cornerstone of energy production and scientific research. This presentation provides a concise overview of the fundamental principles governing fission processes, focusing on the interplay between nuclear structure, neutron interactions, and energy release.  We will explore the key characteristics of fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, highlighting their unique nuclear properties that enable sustained chain reactions.  The presentation will delve into the mechanisms of neutron-induced fission, including prompt and delayed neutron emission, and their crucial roles in reactor control and criticality.  Furthermore, we will examine the energy spectrum of fission fragments and their subsequent radioactive decay, emphasizing the associated challenges in nuclear waste management.  A brief comparison of different fission reactor designs will be presented, touching upon thermal and fast reactors, alongside a discussion of their respective advantages and disadvantages.  Finally, we will briefly address current research directions in advanced fission technologies, including accelerator-driven systems and innovative fuel cycles aimed at enhancing efficiency and reducing proliferation risks.
