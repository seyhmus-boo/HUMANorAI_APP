This presentation explores the quantum mechanical underpinnings of nuclear fission processes, moving beyond the classical liquid-drop model.  We focus on the crucial role of quantum tunneling in overcoming the fission barrier, a process essential for initiating the chain reaction.  Specifically, we will examine the probability of tunneling as a function of nuclear deformation and the influence of shell effects on the potential energy landscape.  The presentation will delve into the impact of quantum fluctuations on the pre-fission dynamics, highlighting the limitations of purely classical descriptions. We will further discuss the role of specific quantum numbers and their conservation during the fission process, influencing the resulting fragment mass and energy distributions.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon advanced theoretical frameworks, including time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and its application in simulating the complex many-body dynamics of fission.  The aim is to provide a concise overview of how quantum mechanics is indispensable for a complete understanding of nuclear fission, ultimately contributing to improved reactor design and nuclear waste management strategies.
