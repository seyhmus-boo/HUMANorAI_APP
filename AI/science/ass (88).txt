Experimental verification of quantum entanglement, while demonstrably successful, presents significant challenges.  Precise control over individual quantum systems is paramount, demanding highly sophisticated experimental apparatus capable of isolating the entangled particles from environmental decoherence.  This necessitates extremely low temperatures, high vacuum conditions, and shielding from electromagnetic noise, all of which contribute to the complexity and cost of entanglement experiments.  Furthermore, the detection efficiency of quantum systems remains a significant hurdle.  Imperfect detectors lead to missed events, potentially misinterpreting genuine entanglement as a classical correlation.  Characterizing the degree of entanglement, often quantified by entanglement witnesses or fidelity measurements, requires careful calibration and rigorous statistical analysis to account for experimental imperfections and noise.  The fragility of quantum states also presents a considerable obstacle, demanding extremely short measurement times to minimize the impact of decoherence before entanglement can be verified.  Overcoming these experimental limitations continues to be a key focus of research, pushing the boundaries of technological advancement in fields such as cryogenics, precision measurement, and quantum control.
