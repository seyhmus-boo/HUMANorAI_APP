Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, can be conceptually understood through the analogy of a delicately balanced ball perched atop a hill.  This ball represents the unstable nucleus, such as Uranium-235.  A small nudge, analogous to the absorption of a neutron, disrupts the delicate equilibrium.  This initiates a cascade effect: the ball rolls down the hill, releasing potential energy in the process.  Similarly, the absorption of a neutron by a fissile nucleus causes it to become highly unstable, deforming and ultimately splitting into two smaller nuclei (fission fragments).  These fragments possess significantly less mass than the original nucleus, the “missing” mass having been converted into an enormous amount of kinetic energy, analogous to the ball's increased velocity at the bottom of the hill. This energy release manifests as heat and the emission of further neutrons, which, in a chain reaction, can trigger the fission of other unstable nuclei, perpetuating the process much like a series of balls rolling down the hill, initiating further cascades. Controlling this chain reaction is crucial in nuclear reactors, achieved through the careful management of neutron absorption and moderation to prevent an uncontrolled release of energy, analogous to carefully controlling the slope and surface friction of the hill.
