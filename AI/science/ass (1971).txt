Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, exhibit a unique combination of properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, with Young's modulus exceeding that of steel, is a direct consequence of this strong covalent bonding.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality (the angle of the hexagonal lattice relative to the nanotube axis).  This tunable conductivity, alongside their high aspect ratio, makes them attractive for applications in electronics.  Thermal conductivity in CNTs is also exceptionally high, surpassing that of many known materials, enabling efficient heat dissipation.  Finally, their large surface area, coupled with chemical inertness under ambient conditions, renders them suitable for applications in catalysis, sensing, and energy storage.  However, challenges remain in scalable production and the effective dispersion of CNTs in composite materials to fully realize their potential across diverse fields.
