DNA replication, the process by which a cell creates an identical copy of its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding emerged from Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty's 1944 demonstration that DNA, not protein, carried hereditary information, paving the way for subsequent investigations.  The elucidation of DNA's double-helical structure by Watson and Crick in 1953 provided the crucial framework, suggesting a semi-conservative mechanism â€“ each strand serving as a template for a new complementary strand.

Meselson and Stahl's elegant experiment in 1958 definitively confirmed this semi-conservative model, using density gradient centrifugation to track DNA replication in *E. coli*.  The process itself is initiated at specific origins of replication, unwound by helicases, and stabilized by single-stranded binding proteins.  DNA polymerases, crucial enzymes, synthesize new strands in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to the formation of leading and lagging strands, the latter synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  Primase generates RNA primers for polymerase initiation, while ligase joins the Okazaki fragments.  Telomerase addresses the replication problem at chromosome ends, preventing shortening.  High fidelity is ensured through proofreading mechanisms intrinsic to DNA polymerases and various repair pathways.  Understanding DNA replication remains crucial for advancements in fields such as genetic engineering and cancer research.
