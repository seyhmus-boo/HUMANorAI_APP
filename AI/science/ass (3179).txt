DNA replication, the process by which genetic material is duplicated, is fundamental to all life.  This intricate process ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next, underpinning cellular division, organismal development, and evolutionary continuity.  While the fundamental principles of semi-conservative replication are well-established, ongoing research continues to unravel the complexities of this process at both the molecular and cellular levels.  This paper reviews current understanding of eukaryotic DNA replication, focusing on key enzymatic players, including DNA polymerases, helicases, and topoisomerases, and their coordinated actions within the replisome complex.  We further examine the intricate mechanisms governing replication origin firing, licensing, and the challenges presented by challenging genomic features such as repetitive sequences and telomeres.  Specific attention is given to recent advancements in our understanding of replication fork stability and the cellular responses to replication stress, including mechanisms of damage tolerance and repair.  This review highlights both established knowledge and emerging areas of investigation, emphasizing the dynamic and multifaceted nature of DNA replication and its crucial role in maintaining genome integrity.
