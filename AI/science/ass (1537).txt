This presentation provides a concise overview of chemical bonding and molecular structure, highlighting recent advancements in our understanding and predictive capabilities.  We will begin by revisiting fundamental concepts, including valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory, emphasizing their strengths and limitations in describing diverse bonding scenarios.  Recent developments in density functional theory (DFT) calculations will be discussed, showcasing their increasing accuracy and applicability in predicting molecular geometries and properties of complex systems, including those intractable via traditional methods.  Furthermore, we will explore the burgeoning field of  machine learning in chemistry, detailing how sophisticated algorithms are being employed to predict bonding patterns and properties from large datasets, accelerating materials discovery and design.  Specific examples will include the application of these techniques to exotic bonding situations such as multiple bonds involving heavier elements and the prediction of novel stable molecules.  Finally, we will briefly address ongoing challenges and future directions in the field, particularly the need for improved computational methods to accurately model dynamic processes and complex intermolecular interactions.
