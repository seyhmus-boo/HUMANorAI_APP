Black hole formation remains a pivotal area of astrophysical research, bridging fundamental physics with observational astronomy.  This paper explores the diverse mechanisms leading to the creation of these enigmatic objects, focusing on stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  We review the current understanding of stellar collapse, emphasizing the role of progenitor star mass, metallicity, and rotation in determining the final fate â€“ either a neutron star or a black hole.  Furthermore, we examine the competing theories for supermassive black hole formation, including direct collapse scenarios in primordial gas clouds and the hierarchical merging of stellar-mass black holes within galactic nuclei.  The paper critically assesses the observational evidence supporting each pathway, including gravitational wave detections from merging black holes, high-redshift quasar observations, and the detection of active galactic nuclei across cosmic time.  We also address open questions and challenges in the field, such as accurately modeling the complex physics of stellar collapse and understanding the seeds of supermassive black holes.  Ultimately, a comprehensive understanding of black hole formation is crucial for advancing our knowledge of galactic evolution, cosmology, and the fundamental laws of gravity.
