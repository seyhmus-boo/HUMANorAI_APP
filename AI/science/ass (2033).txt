Good morning. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission, the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy. This energy liberation stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the daughter nuclei is less than the parent nucleus, the difference being converted to energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  The process is initiated by bombarding a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with a neutron. This neutron absorption causes the nucleus to become unstable, leading to its fission and the release of further neutrons, creating a chain reaction.

The controlled chain reaction is the basis for nuclear fission reactors. These reactors utilize moderators to slow down neutrons, enhancing fission probability, and control rods to absorb neutrons, regulating the reaction rate.  The heat generated during fission is used to produce steam, which drives turbines generating electricity, a crucial application providing a substantial portion of global power.  Uncontrolled chain reactions, conversely, are harnessed in nuclear weapons, although this application remains highly controversial due to its destructive potential.  Therefore, understanding the intricacies of nuclear fission is paramount for both energy production and global security.
