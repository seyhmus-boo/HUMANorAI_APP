CRISPR-Cas systems, revolutionizing genetic engineering, represent a paradigm shift from previous gene editing technologies.  This presentation will trace the evolution of CRISPR from its initial discovery as a bacterial adaptive immune system to its current application as a precise gene editing tool.  Initially identified in the late 1980s as unusual repetitive DNA sequences in *Escherichia coli*, the functional role of CRISPR remained enigmatic until the early 2000s. Subsequent research elucidated the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas systems, highlighting their ability to target and cleave specific DNA sequences guided by CRISPR RNA (crRNA).  This discovery spurred the rapid development of CRISPR-Cas9, a streamlined system readily adaptable for diverse applications.

The presentation will explore the advantages of CRISPR-Cas9, including its simplicity, efficiency, and relatively low cost compared to previous techniques like ZFNs and TALENs.  We will then discuss the broad implications of CRISPR technology, encompassing its applications in gene therapy for inherited diseases, development of disease models, agricultural biotechnology for crop improvement, and its potential in combating infectious diseases. Finally, we will critically address ethical concerns and challenges associated with CRISPR technology, including off-target effects, potential for germline editing, and the necessity for rigorous safety protocols.
