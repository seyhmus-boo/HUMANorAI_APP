Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, is a fundamental process underpinning nuclear energy generation and weaponry. This process typically involves the bombardment of fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with neutrons.  Neutron absorption initiates an unstable nuclear state, leading to the nucleus's subsequent fission. This fission event releases a significant amount of energy, primarily manifested as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  The energy release stems from the mass defect, a consequence of the strong nuclear force binding the nucleons.  The liberated neutrons can then induce further fission events in surrounding fissile material, creating a self-sustaining chain reaction.  The rate of this chain reaction is meticulously controlled in nuclear reactors through neutron moderation and absorption mechanisms, whereas in nuclear weapons, an uncontrolled chain reaction results in a rapid, explosive release of energy.  The efficacy and characteristics of fission processes are significantly influenced by factors including neutron energy, isotopic composition, and reactor design parameters.
