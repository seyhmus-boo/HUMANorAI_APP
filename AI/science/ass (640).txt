Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a topic of considerable theoretical and experimental debate.  While general relativity elegantly predicts the existence and evolution of black holes, directly observing their formation process presents formidable challenges.  The extreme gravitational fields involved render traditional electromagnetic observation methods largely ineffective, particularly during the crucial collapse phase of a stellar remnant or the merger of compact objects.  Indirect evidence, such as gravitational wave detections from binary black hole mergers by LIGO and Virgo, has provided invaluable insights into the final stages of black hole formation, but these observations lack the spatial and temporal resolution to directly trace the collapse mechanism.  Furthermore, the extreme conditions associated with black hole formation necessitate sophisticated theoretical modelling, often incorporating complex numerical simulations that are computationally expensive and potentially sensitive to initial conditions.  This paper will explore the key experimental limitations in understanding black hole formation, focusing on the challenges inherent in observing the pre-collapse phase, resolving the event horizon's formation, and differentiating between competing theoretical models through observational data.  We will examine the limitations of current instrumentation and propose potential avenues for future research, including advanced gravitational wave detectors and the development of novel observational techniques.
