DNA replication, the precise duplication of the genome, is fundamental to life.  This presentation will offer a concise overview of the core mechanisms of eukaryotic DNA replication, focusing on recent advancements in our understanding of this intricate process. We will discuss the complexities of origin firing and the regulation of replication timing, highlighting the roles of chromatin structure and epigenetic modifications in controlling these processes.  Recent breakthroughs utilizing advanced imaging techniques, such as single-molecule analysis and live-cell microscopy, have provided unprecedented insights into the dynamics of replication forks and their response to various forms of replication stress.  Furthermore, the presentation will explore the burgeoning field of replication-associated mutagenesis, emphasizing the emerging understanding of how replication errors contribute to genome instability and disease. Finally, we will briefly touch upon the exciting progress in developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting specific vulnerabilities within the replication machinery for cancer treatment.  This presentation aims to provide a contemporary perspective on DNA replication, showcasing the exciting interplay between fundamental biological mechanisms and their implications for human health.
