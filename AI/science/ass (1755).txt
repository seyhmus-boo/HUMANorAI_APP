Good morning. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, a fundamental process central to life's continuity.  Early understanding of heredity, predating Watson and Crick's 1953 double helix model, hinted at a self-replicating mechanism.  However, the precise mechanism remained elusive until the Meselson-Stahl experiment in 1958 definitively demonstrated semi-conservative replication.  This landmark study proved that each new DNA molecule consists of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.

The process itself begins with unwinding of the double helix by enzymes like helicase, creating a replication fork.  Single-strand binding proteins prevent re-annealing.  Primase then lays down RNA primers, providing starting points for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for adding nucleotides to the growing strand in a 5' to 3' direction.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes primers and fills gaps, and finally, DNA ligase seals the fragments, completing the replication process.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms intrinsic to DNA polymerase.  This remarkably precise and efficient process ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.
