This review summarizes the quantum mechanical perspective on chemical bonding and molecular structure.  Traditional valence bond (VB) theory, while offering a conceptually simple picture of localized bonds, falls short in accurately describing electron delocalization and excited states.  Molecular orbital (MO) theory, founded on the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approximation, provides a more comprehensive framework.  The Schr√∂dinger equation, albeit intractable for all but the simplest systems, underpins MO theory, enabling the calculation of molecular orbitals and their associated energies.  The resulting energy diagrams illustrate bonding and antibonding interactions, dictating molecular stability and geometry.  Density functional theory (DFT) offers a computationally less demanding alternative, approximating the many-body problem through the electron density.  Despite simplifications inherent in both MO and DFT approaches, they provide robust predictions of molecular properties including bond lengths, bond energies, and spectroscopic data.  Furthermore, these theories illuminate the influence of electron correlation and relativistic effects on molecular structure, particularly crucial for heavier elements.  While limitations persist, quantum mechanical approaches offer a significantly enhanced understanding of chemical bonding compared to purely classical models.
