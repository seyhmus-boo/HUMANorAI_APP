Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  These systems, regardless of spatial separation, exhibit a unified quantum state, such that measuring the properties of one instantaneously influences the measurable properties of the others, even exceeding the limitations imposed by the speed of light.  This correlation is not due to classical hidden variables, as proven by Bell's theorem and subsequent experimental violations of Bell inequalities.  Entanglement arises from the superposition principle, where quantum systems can exist in a linear combination of eigenstates, and the tensor product structure of composite quantum systems.  The entangled state is described by a wavefunction that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each subsystem, signifying their inextricable correlation.  This phenomenon has profound implications for quantum information science, enabling quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  Further research focuses on understanding the limits of entanglement creation, manipulation, and its role in complex quantum many-body systems.
