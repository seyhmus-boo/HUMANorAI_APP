Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, is a process underpinned by the strong and weak nuclear forces, resulting in the release of substantial energy.  This energy liberation stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the fission products is less than the original nucleus, the difference converted to energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.  The process is initiated by neutron bombardment, typically employing thermal or fast neutrons depending on the fissile material.  Chain reactions are possible due to the emission of additional neutrons during fission, allowing for self-sustaining reactions in critical masses.  Fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, are crucial for sustained fission, exhibiting high neutron cross-sections.  Fission product yields are statistically distributed, producing a range of radioactive isotopes with varying half-lives, posing significant challenges regarding nuclear waste management.  Different fission mechanisms exist, including symmetric and asymmetric fission, influenced by nuclear shell structure and deformation.  Further research focuses on improving reactor efficiency, minimizing waste production, and exploring the potential of advanced reactor designs for enhanced safety and sustainability.
