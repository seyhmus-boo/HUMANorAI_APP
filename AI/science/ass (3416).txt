Photosynthesis, the cornerstone of most life on Earth, has captivated scientists for centuries.  Early understanding, dating back to the 17th century with van Helmont's willow tree experiment and Priestley's discovery of oxygen production, laid the groundwork for later breakthroughs.  This presentation will explore the mechanistic details of photosynthetic processes, focusing on both the light-dependent and light-independent reactions.  We will review the crucial role of photosystems I and II in capturing light energy and driving electron transport, highlighting the generation of ATP and NADPH.  The subsequent Calvin-Benson cycle, responsible for carbon fixation and carbohydrate synthesis, will be discussed, emphasizing the catalytic action of Rubisco and the complexities of carbon concentrating mechanisms in C4 and CAM plants.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly touch upon the evolution of photosynthesis, tracing its development from anoxygenic pathways to the oxygenic system prevalent in plants and algae. By integrating historical context with contemporary understanding, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of photosynthetic mechanisms and their remarkable impact on our planet.
