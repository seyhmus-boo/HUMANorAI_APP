The study of chemical bonding and molecular structure, while fundamental to chemistry, presents significant experimental challenges.  Determining precise bond lengths and angles relies heavily on techniques like X-ray diffraction and neutron scattering, both of which require high-quality single crystals, a limitation often insurmountable for complex or unstable molecules.  Spectroscopic methods, such as NMR and IR spectroscopy, provide valuable indirect information, but interpreting spectra can be complex and ambiguous, particularly for large or asymmetric molecules.  Furthermore,  studying molecules in their natural environment (e.g., biological systems) adds further complexity, requiring specialized techniques like in-situ and in-vivo spectroscopy, which often suffer from lower resolution and signal-to-noise ratios.  Computational methods offer a valuable complement, but their accuracy is dependent on the quality of theoretical models and computational power, and they may not accurately capture dynamic processes or subtle interactions.  Ultimately, a complete understanding often necessitates a multi-faceted approach, integrating diverse experimental techniques with theoretical calculations to overcome the inherent limitations of individual methods. The challenge lies not only in obtaining data, but also in its rigorous interpretation and integration to provide a coherent picture of molecular structure and bonding.
