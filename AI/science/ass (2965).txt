Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have garnered significant scientific and technological interest.  Their remarkable tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, coupled with high flexibility and low density, makes them promising candidates for advanced composite materials.  Electrical properties are highly dependent on chirality and diameter, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, offering potential for applications in nanoelectronics and sensors.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptionally high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of diamond in some cases, making them ideal for thermal management applications.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT synthesis for precise chirality and diameter distribution, as well as overcoming challenges associated with their dispersion and integration into macroscopic systems.  This review summarizes the key properties of CNTs, highlighting their potential for diverse applications while acknowledging current limitations and outlining future research directions towards realizing their full potential.  Further research focusing on scalable, cost-effective synthesis and improved processing techniques is crucial for widespread technological adoption.
