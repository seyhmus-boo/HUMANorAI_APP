This presentation addresses experimental challenges encountered in the precise determination of chemical bonding and molecular structure.  While theoretical models provide valuable insights, experimental verification remains crucial.  We will explore the limitations of various techniques, focusing on the difficulties inherent in obtaining high-resolution structural data for complex molecules and dynamic systems.  Diffraction methods, such as X-ray and neutron diffraction, while powerful, are often hampered by sample crystallinity requirements and radiation damage.  Spectroscopic techniques, including NMR and IR spectroscopy, offer complementary information but can struggle with spectral overlap and ambiguity in peak assignments, particularly for large or disordered systems.  Furthermore, the study of transient species and reaction intermediates presents significant challenges due to their short lifetimes and low concentrations, requiring advanced time-resolved techniques with high sensitivity.  This presentation will discuss strategies to overcome these experimental obstacles, highlighting advancements in instrumentation and data analysis methods such as machine learning, paving the way for a more comprehensive and accurate understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure across diverse chemical systems.  We will conclude by outlining promising future directions in experimental methodology.
