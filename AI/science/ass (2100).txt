Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, presents profound implications for quantum computing and communication.  However, realizing its full potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges. This presentation will explore these challenges, focusing on three key areas:  (1) State preparation and maintenance:  Generating and preserving entangled states, particularly for larger systems, is extremely demanding.  Decoherence, caused by interactions with the environment, rapidly destroys entanglement, requiring sophisticated techniques such as quantum error correction and cryogenic cooling. (2) State verification:  Unambiguously confirming entanglement in complex systems is non-trivial.  Bell inequality violations provide a crucial test, but their experimental implementation often faces limitations due to detection inefficiencies and loopholes.  The development of robust and scalable verification protocols remains a crucial area of research. (3) Scalability:  Extending entanglement experiments beyond a handful of qubits presents a major hurdle.  Scaling up the required hardware and control systems while maintaining coherence is a significant technological challenge. This presentation will review recent advances in addressing these challenges and discuss future directions for experimental research aimed at overcoming them and realizing the potential of entangled quantum systems.
