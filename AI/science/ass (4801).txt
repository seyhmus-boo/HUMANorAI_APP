Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), despite their remarkable theoretical properties, present significant experimental challenges hindering their widespread application.  Precise control over nanotube chirality, diameter, and length remains a considerable hurdle.  Current synthesis methods, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD), often yield a heterogeneous mixture of CNTs with varying structural parameters, complicating characterization and impacting performance.  Furthermore, the inherent tendency of CNTs to agglomerate due to strong van der Waals forces necessitates the development of effective dispersion techniques, often involving harsh chemical treatments that may compromise structural integrity or introduce impurities.  Accurate measurement of mechanical properties, such as tensile strength and Young's modulus, is also challenging, requiring specialized techniques capable of manipulating individual nanotubes without inducing damage.  Similarly, precise electrical characterization demands careful control of contact resistance and the elimination of parasitic effects from substrate materials.  These experimental difficulties necessitate ongoing research into refined synthesis methodologies, advanced characterization techniques, and effective functionalization strategies to fully unlock the potential of CNTs in diverse technological applications.
