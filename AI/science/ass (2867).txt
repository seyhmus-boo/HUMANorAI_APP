Black hole formation remains a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, representing a critical juncture in the lifecycle of massive stars and a fundamental test of Einstein's theory of General Relativity.  This paper investigates the diverse pathways leading to black hole genesis, focusing on the interplay between stellar evolution and the complex processes governing gravitational collapse. We review the current understanding of core-collapse supernovae as the dominant mechanism for the formation of stellar-mass black holes, examining the influence of progenitor star mass, metallicity, and rotation on the final fate of the collapsing core.  Furthermore, we address the less well-understood formation mechanisms for supermassive black holes (SMBHs), exploring competing theories involving direct collapse, mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and the role of galactic dynamics in their growth.  By synthesizing recent observational data from gravitational wave astronomy, electromagnetic surveys, and numerical simulations, we aim to refine our understanding of the conditions necessary for black hole formation across the mass spectrum and elucidate the connection between these enigmatic objects and their galactic environments.  This review highlights existing challenges and proposes avenues for future research to advance our comprehension of this crucial astrophysical phenomenon.
