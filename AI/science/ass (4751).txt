Determining the precise nature of chemical bonding and molecular structure presents significant experimental challenges.  While theoretical models offer valuable insights, experimental validation remains crucial.  Diffraction techniques, such as X-ray and neutron diffraction, provide crucial information on atomic positions within crystals, but are limited to ordered solids and may struggle with disordered systems or complex molecules.  Spectroscopic methods, including infrared (IR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopies, offer complementary data on vibrational modes and nuclear environments respectively, but interpreting complex spectra can be computationally intensive and ambiguous.  Furthermore, the resolution of these techniques is often insufficient to accurately determine the positions of light atoms, particularly hydrogen, in complex molecules.  Electron diffraction, while offering higher resolution, is less readily applicable to larger molecules.  Analyzing dynamic processes, such as bond breaking and formation, necessitates advanced time-resolved techniques, such as ultrafast spectroscopy, which are often technologically demanding and require sophisticated data analysis.  Overcoming these limitations necessitates the development and application of increasingly sophisticated instrumentation and computational methods for data analysis, emphasizing the ongoing evolution of this field.
