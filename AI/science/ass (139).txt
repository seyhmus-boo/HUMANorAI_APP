Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, operates via two interconnected mechanisms: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The light-dependent reactions are analogous to a water pump powered by sunlight.  Photons, acting as the electricity, excite chlorophyll molecules within photosystems embedded in thylakoid membranes. This excitation, like the pump's motor, drives the splitting of water molecules (photolysis), releasing electrons. These electrons traverse an electron transport chain, analogous to a series of water wheels, generating a proton gradient. This gradient, representing stored potential energy, drives ATP synthase, a molecular turbine generating ATP, the energy currency of the cell.  Simultaneously, NADP+ is reduced to NADPH, a reducing agent akin to a charged battery.

The light-independent reactions, in contrast, resemble a factory assembly line.  The ATP and NADPH produced in the light-dependent reactions act as the energy and reducing power, respectively, fueling the fixation of carbon dioxide.  Through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, CO2 is incorporated into an existing five-carbon molecule, and subsequently converted into glucose, a sugar molecule representing the final product, analogous to the finished goods of the factory. This glucose stores the chemical energy initially captured from sunlight.
