The formation of black holes, singularities predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity, remains a central problem in astrophysics.  Early conceptualizations, though lacking observational evidence, emerged alongside the theory itself, with Karl Schwarzschild's 1916 solution providing the first theoretical description of a non-rotating black hole.  However, the true nature and prevalence of these objects remained elusive for decades.  The mid-20th century witnessed crucial advancements, including Oppenheimer and Snyder's 1939 work demonstrating the gravitational collapse of a sufficiently massive star into a singularity, thereby establishing a plausible formation mechanism.  Yet, concrete observational verification proved challenging, hampered by the inherent invisibility of black holes.

The latter half of the 20th century saw a paradigm shift. The identification of strong X-ray sources, coupled with improved observational techniques, provided compelling indirect evidence supporting the existence of black holes, initially through observations of stellar-mass black holes in binary systems.  Subsequent discoveries, including the detection of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, broadened the scope of research and revealed the critical role black holes play in galactic evolution. This paper will delve into the various mechanisms of black hole formation, focusing on both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes, exploring the theoretical underpinnings and analyzing the current observational evidence that supports these models.
