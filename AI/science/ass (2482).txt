Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a vibrant area of research.  This presentation will review the primary mechanisms leading to black hole genesis, focusing on stellar-mass black holes formed through the gravitational collapse of massive stars and supermassive black holes whose formation pathways remain a topic of significant debate.  We will examine the crucial role of stellar evolution, including the influence of metallicity and binary interactions, in shaping the final fate of stars and the subsequent emergence of stellar-mass black holes.  For supermassive black holes, competing models including direct collapse, seed black hole growth, and mergers will be discussed, highlighting the challenges in observationally constraining their formation.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly touch upon practical applications derived from this research.  The study of black hole formation informs our understanding of galaxy evolution, providing crucial constraints on cosmological models.  Moreover, advanced techniques employed in black hole research, such as gravitational wave detection and high-resolution imaging, translate to advancements in other fields, such as materials science and precision engineering.  The presentation concludes by outlining key open questions and future research directions in this dynamic field.
