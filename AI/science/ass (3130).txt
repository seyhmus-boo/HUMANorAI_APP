Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, presents a profound departure from classical intuition. This presentation offers a concise overview of entanglement from a purely quantum mechanical perspective, focusing on its mathematical description and fundamental implications. We will begin by introducing the concept of composite quantum systems and their associated Hilbert spaces, highlighting the crucial distinction between separable and entangled states.  The density matrix formalism will be employed to formally define entanglement and discuss criteria for its quantification, such as concurrence and entanglement entropy.  We will then explore the violation of Bell's inequalities as a definitive experimental demonstration of the non-classical nature of entangled states, surpassing the limitations of local realism.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly touch upon the crucial role of entanglement in quantum information processing, including applications in quantum teleportation and quantum cryptography. Finally, we will conclude by discussing some of the ongoing theoretical and experimental challenges in understanding and manipulating entangled states, particularly in the context of decoherence and scaling up to larger systems.
