Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, sharing the same fate regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This interconnectedness transcends classical physics; measuring a property of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the other, even across vast distances. This correlation violates Bell's inequalities, demonstrating the inherent non-locality of quantum mechanics.  The underlying mechanism is believed to involve the particles' shared quantum state, described by a superposition until measurement collapses the wavefunction.  This collapse, seemingly instantaneous across space, is a source of much debate and ongoing research.

Practical applications of entanglement remain largely theoretical but hold immense potential. Quantum computing leverages entanglement to perform computations impossible for classical computers, enabling faster and more efficient algorithms.  Quantum cryptography utilizes entanglement for secure communication channels, exploiting the principle that any attempt to intercept information will disrupt the entangled state, alerting the communicators to eavesdropping.  Furthermore, quantum teleportation, though not the transfer of matter, uses entanglement to transmit quantum states between particles, paving the way for advanced quantum networks and potentially novel sensing technologies.
