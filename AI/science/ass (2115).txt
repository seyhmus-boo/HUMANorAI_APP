Catalysts in organic chemistry profoundly accelerate reaction rates by lowering the activation energy, a phenomenon readily explained through a quantum mechanical lens.  The catalyst interacts with reactants, forming a transient catalyst-reactant complex.  This interaction alters the electronic structure of the reactants, achieved by orbital overlap and subsequent electron redistribution.  Specifically, catalyst orbitals interact with reactant frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), namely the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).  

This interaction can stabilize the transition state, the highest energy point along the reaction coordinate, by lowering its energy. This lowering occurs because the catalyst provides an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy.  This may involve facilitating bond breaking or formation through orbital interactions that redistribute electron density towards the forming or breaking bonds, thus reducing the energy barrier. Ultimately, the catalyst remains unchanged after the reaction, having facilitated the formation of products via manipulation of the reactant's quantum mechanical wavefunctions and associated energy levels.
