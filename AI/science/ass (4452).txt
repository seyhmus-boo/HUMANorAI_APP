DNA replication, the process by which a cell creates an identical copy of its DNA, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding, predating Watson and Crick's 1953 model, hinted at a semi-conservative mechanism, a concept solidified by Meselson and Stahl's 1958 experiment using isotopic labeling.  This experiment demonstrated that each new DNA molecule retains one parental strand and incorporates one newly synthesized strand.

The process begins with the unwinding of the double helix by enzymes like helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-strand binding proteins stabilize the separated strands, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing starting points for DNA polymerase III, the enzyme responsible for the bulk of DNA synthesis.  Polymerase III adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to the formation of the leading and lagging strands. The lagging strand, synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments, requires additional processing involving DNA polymerase I (removal of primers) and DNA ligase (joining of fragments).  Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, pose a replication challenge addressed by telomerase in some cells.  The high fidelity of replication, ensured by proofreading mechanisms intrinsic to DNA polymerase, is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity.
