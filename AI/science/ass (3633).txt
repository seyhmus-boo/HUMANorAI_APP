DNA replication, the process of duplicating a cell's genome, is a fundamental biological process crucial for cell division and heredity.  The semi-conservative mechanism, where each new DNA molecule retains one parental strand, is well-established.  Replication initiates at specific origins of replication, unwound by helicases and stabilized by single-strand binding proteins.  Leading and lagging strands are synthesized by DNA polymerases, with the lagging strand requiring the synthesis of Okazaki fragments and subsequent ligation.  Telomeres, repetitive sequences at chromosome ends, pose a unique challenge, addressed by telomerase in some cells.

Recent developments have refined our understanding of replication dynamics.  High-throughput sequencing and single-molecule techniques have elucidated the spatiotemporal organization of replication forks, revealing the complexity of replication timing and the impact of chromatin structure.  Studies on the replisome, the complex of proteins involved in replication, have identified new accessory factors and regulatory mechanisms influencing replication fidelity and speed.  Furthermore, research on the interplay between replication and DNA repair pathways is uncovering how cells handle replication stress and maintain genomic integrity.  These advances provide a more nuanced picture of this essential cellular process and its implications in disease.
