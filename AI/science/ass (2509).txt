Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, a fundamental process crucial for life's continuity.  Early understanding of heredity, predating the discovery of DNA's structure, hinted at a self-replicating mechanism.  However, the elucidation of the double helix by Watson and Crick in 1953 provided the crucial framework.  Their model immediately suggested a semiconservative mechanism, where each strand serves as a template for a new complementary strand.

This hypothesis was subsequently confirmed experimentally by Meselson and Stahl.  The process itself involves several key enzymes, including helicase, which unwinds the DNA double helix; DNA polymerase, which adds nucleotides to the growing strand; and primase, which synthesizes RNA primers necessary for polymerase initiation.  Replication proceeds bidirectionally from origins of replication, resulting in two identical DNA molecules, each composed of one parental and one newly synthesized strand.  Proofreading mechanisms minimize errors, ensuring high fidelity, crucial for maintaining genomic integrity across generations.  Failures in this precise process can lead to mutations with significant consequences.
