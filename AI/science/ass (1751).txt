Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional material properties underpinning their diverse applications.  Their exceptional tensile strength, exceeding that of steel by several orders of magnitude, is a direct consequence of the strong covalent bonds within their hexagonal lattice structure.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate remarkable electrical conductivity, behaving either as metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality (the arrangement of the hexagonal carbon rings). This tunable conductivity is crucial for their use in electronics.  Their high aspect ratio (length-to-diameter ratio) contributes to their superior mechanical properties and facilitates their incorporation into composite materials to enhance strength and stiffness.  Additionally, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, making them suitable for thermal management applications.  These unique properties have led to the exploration of CNTs in a variety of fields, including advanced composites for aerospace and automotive industries, high-performance electronics such as transistors and interconnects, energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors, and biomedical applications such as drug delivery and biosensors.  Ongoing research continues to explore the full potential of these versatile nanomaterials.
