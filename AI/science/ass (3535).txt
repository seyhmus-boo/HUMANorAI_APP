DNA replication, the process by which a cell creates an identical copy of its DNA, is fundamental to life.  It proceeds via a semi-conservative mechanism, meaning each new DNA molecule consists of one original (parental) strand and one newly synthesized strand.  This process is initiated at specific sites called origins of replication, where the double helix unwinds, creating replication forks.  DNA polymerase, the key enzyme, adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing strand, synthesizing the leading strand continuously and the lagging strand discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  Helicases unwind the DNA, while topoisomerases relieve torsional stress.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers to initiate DNA polymerase activity.  Finally, ligase joins the Okazaki fragments.  The fidelity of DNA replication is remarkably high due to the proofreading activity of DNA polymerase and other repair mechanisms.  Understanding DNA replication has numerous practical applications, including advancements in forensic science (DNA fingerprinting), medical diagnostics (detecting genetic mutations), and biotechnology (gene cloning and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology).  PCR, in particular, relies heavily on the principles of DNA replication to exponentially amplify specific DNA sequences, facilitating diverse applications from disease diagnosis to ancient DNA analysis.
