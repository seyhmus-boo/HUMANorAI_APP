Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have spurred extensive research into their potential applications.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel, make them ideal for reinforcing composites in aerospace and automotive industries.  Depending on their chirality, CNTs can behave as metallic or semiconducting materials, facilitating their use in advanced electronics, including high-frequency transistors and flexible circuitry.  Their high thermal conductivity enables efficient heat dissipation in microelectronics and thermal management systems.  Furthermore, CNTs possess a large surface area, making them attractive for energy storage applications such as supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries, as well as in catalysis and sensing due to their ability to adsorb various molecules.  However, challenges remain in scalable, cost-effective production and in overcoming issues related to dispersion and functionalization for optimal integration into practical devices.  Ongoing research focuses on addressing these challenges to fully realize the potential of CNTs across diverse technological domains.
