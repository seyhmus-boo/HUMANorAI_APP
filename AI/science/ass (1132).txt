DNA replication, the fundamental process underlying heredity and cellular proliferation, is conventionally understood through the lens of classical biochemistry.  However, recent advancements in quantum biology suggest that quantum mechanical phenomena may play a subtle yet significant role in this seemingly deterministic process. This paper explores the emerging field of quantum effects in DNA replication, moving beyond the classical description of base pairing and polymerase activity.  We argue that a complete understanding requires consideration of quantum phenomena, specifically focusing on the potential influence of quantum entanglement and tunneling effects on fidelity and speed.  While the direct experimental evidence for quantum involvement remains limited, theoretical models and indirect observations suggest potential mechanisms.  This review will examine these theoretical frameworks, exploring how quantum coherence could contribute to the accurate and rapid replication of the genome.  Furthermore, we will critically assess the limitations of current experimental techniques in detecting these subtle quantum effects and propose avenues for future research aimed at providing definitive evidence for quantum contributions to DNA replication's efficiency and accuracy.
