Chemical bonding and molecular structure represent a cornerstone of chemistry, explaining the forces holding atoms together and dictating macroscopic properties. Early attempts at understanding bonding, such as the valence bond theory emerging from the work of G.N. Lewis in the early 20th century, focused on electron sharing to achieve stable octets.  This simplistic model, however, proved insufficient to explain the complexities of molecular geometry and bonding in molecules like benzene.

Subsequent developments, notably molecular orbital theory (MOT), provided a more sophisticated quantum mechanical description. MOT considers the combination of atomic orbitals to form delocalized molecular orbitals, encompassing bonding, antibonding, and non-bonding interactions.  This framework successfully accounts for phenomena such as resonance and aromaticity, offering a more accurate representation of electron distribution and bond order.  Furthermore, valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory effectively predicts molecular geometry based on the repulsion between electron pairs in the valence shell.  

These theories, although distinct, are complementary.  VSEPR offers a readily applicable predictive tool, while MOT provides a deeper understanding of the underlying electronic structure.  The ongoing evolution of computational chemistry allows for increasingly accurate predictions and simulations of molecular structure and reactivity, building upon the foundational concepts established by these landmark theories.
