The remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their unique quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp² hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a cylindrical configuration result in a delocalized π-electron system extending along the nanotube axis. This extended π-system is crucial to understanding CNTs' electrical conductivity, which exhibits strong dependence on chirality (the helical arrangement of the carbon atoms).  Armchair nanotubes possess a metallic character due to their specific band structure, featuring a linear dispersion relation at the Fermi level resulting in high conductivity. In contrast, zigzag and chiral nanotubes can be either metallic or semiconducting, with the band gap exhibiting a dependence on the nanotube diameter and chiral angle. This electronic structure is dictated by the quantum confinement effect, where the one-dimensional nature of the CNT restricts electron movement, leading to energy quantization and the formation of distinct energy levels.  Furthermore, the strong covalent bonding between carbon atoms contributes to exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, a consequence of the robust σ-bonding framework and the delocalized π-electrons contributing to overall stability.  Consequently,  understanding the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons within the CNT lattice is paramount to explaining and predicting their diverse and technologically significant properties.
