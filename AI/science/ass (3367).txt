Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally explained by quantum mechanics, specifically through the interactions of electrons and nuclei.  The Born-Oppenheimer approximation allows for the separation of nuclear and electronic motion, simplifying the problem by treating nuclei as stationary points around which electrons move.  Molecular orbitals (MOs), formed by linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAOs), describe the probability density of electrons within the molecule.  The principles of orbital overlap and constructive/destructive interference govern bond formation.  Strong covalent bonds arise from significant overlap of atomic orbitals, leading to a decrease in total energy, while weaker interactions, like van der Waals forces, are explained by instantaneous dipole moments and induced polarizations.  Molecular geometry is dictated by the spatial arrangement of MOs, which is influenced by factors such as electron-electron repulsion, Pauli exclusion principle, and the minimization of potential energy.  Advanced computational methods, including density functional theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock techniques, are crucial for accurate prediction and analysis of molecular structures and properties that are intractable via simpler models,  allowing deeper investigation into complex bonding scenarios like hypervalency and aromaticity.  Understanding the quantum mechanical underpinnings of bonding is critical for interpreting chemical reactivity and predicting material properties.
