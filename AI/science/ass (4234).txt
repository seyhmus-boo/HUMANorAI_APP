Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit a unique combination of properties rendering them attractive for diverse technological applications.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from strong covalent C-C bonds and their inherent tubular structure, results in high tensile strength and Young's modulus exceeding that of steel.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality (the arrangement of hexagons in the lattice), allowing for their integration into electronic devices.  Their high aspect ratio, typically possessing lengths orders of magnitude greater than their diameter, contributes to their remarkable surface area, facilitating their use in energy storage and catalysis.  These properties, coupled with their thermal conductivity exceeding that of copper, are exploited in various fields.  Practical applications include reinforcement in composite materials for lightweight yet strong structures in aerospace and automotive industries,  high-performance transistors and sensors leveraging their unique electronic properties, and high-capacity energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and batteries, owing to their superior surface area and conductivity.  Ongoing research continues to explore further applications across fields like biomedical engineering and water purification.
