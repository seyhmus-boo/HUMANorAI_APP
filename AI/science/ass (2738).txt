Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient tool for genome editing across diverse organisms. This review examines the application of CRISPR technology in genetic engineering, focusing on its mechanisms, advancements, and broad implications.  While initially discovered as a prokaryotic adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas9, in particular, has been adapted for targeted gene modification in eukaryotic systems, leveraging its simplicity and programmability.  This technology enables gene knockouts, knockins, and base editing with unprecedented accuracy, surpassing previous methods in both efficacy and accessibility.  We explore the various Cas enzymes and their associated guide RNA designs, highlighting recent improvements in specificity and off-target reduction. Furthermore, this review discusses the ethical considerations and potential challenges associated with widespread CRISPR adoption, including the potential for unintended consequences and the need for robust regulatory frameworks.  Ultimately, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of CRISPR-mediated genetic engineering, its future prospects, and the critical discussions surrounding its responsible application across diverse fields, including medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology.
