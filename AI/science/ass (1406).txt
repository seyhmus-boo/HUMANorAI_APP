This presentation provides an overview of key plasma physics phenomena relevant to contemporary research and technological applications.  We begin by outlining fundamental plasma properties, including Debye shielding and plasma oscillations, establishing a foundation for understanding more complex behaviours.  The presentation then explores collective effects, focusing on waves and instabilities crucial in fusion energy research, space physics, and astrophysics. Specific examples include magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) waves, responsible for energy transport in the solar corona, and various microinstabilities limiting confinement in magnetic fusion devices.  Further discussion will cover nonlinear phenomena, such as magnetic reconnection, a process driving explosive energy release in solar flares and contributing to disruptions in tokamaks. Finally, we will briefly address current research directions, including the development of advanced diagnostics for plasma characterisation and the simulation of complex plasma behaviours using high-performance computing. The presentation aims to highlight the multifaceted nature of plasma physics and its vital role in addressing critical challenges in science and technology.
