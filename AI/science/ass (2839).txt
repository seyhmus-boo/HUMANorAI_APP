DNA replication, the process by which a cell creates an identical copy of its DNA, is fundamental to cellular proliferation and heredity.  Early understanding of this crucial process emerged from the seminal work of Watson and Crick (1953), who elucidated the double-helical structure of DNA, suggesting a semi-conservative replication mechanism.  This hypothesis, subsequently confirmed experimentally by Meselson and Stahl (1958), posited that each strand of the parental DNA serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.

The process begins with the unwinding of the double helix by enzymes like helicases, creating replication forks.  DNA polymerases, the key enzymes in replication, then add nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing strand, guided by base-pairing rules (A with T, G with C).  Leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously, whereas lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously in Okazaki fragments, requiring RNA primers and subsequent ligation.  The remarkable accuracy of DNA replication is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases and various repair pathways that address errors arising during replication.  This fidelity ensures the accurate transmission of genetic information from one generation to the next.
