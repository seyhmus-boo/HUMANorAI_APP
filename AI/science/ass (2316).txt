CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in genome editing. However, despite their widespread adoption, several experimental challenges remain significant hurdles to their broader application. This presentation will examine key limitations currently hindering CRISPR's full potential.  We will discuss the complexities of off-target effects, highlighting the ongoing development of improved guide RNA design strategies and computational tools for minimizing unintended modifications.  Further, the presentation will address challenges related to delivery systems, particularly for in vivo applications, examining the limitations of viral and non-viral vectors in achieving efficient and targeted gene editing in diverse cell types and tissues.  The inconsistent editing efficiencies across different cell lines and organisms will also be addressed, exploring the influence of factors such as chromatin structure and cellular repair pathways on CRISPR efficacy. Finally, we will briefly discuss ethical considerations stemming from the power and accessibility of this technology, emphasizing the need for responsible research practices and rigorous safety assessments.  The overall aim is to provide a critical overview of current experimental challenges and highlight avenues for future research aimed at optimizing CRISPR technology for therapeutic and research applications.
