Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are inextricably intertwined, regardless of spatial separation.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, exhibiting stronger than classical statistical dependencies.  Mathematically, entangled states are represented by composite wavefunctions that cannot be factored into separate wavefunctions for individual systems.  For instance, a maximally entangled Bell state of two qubits, denoted |Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2, illustrates this inseparability; measuring the state of one qubit instantaneously determines the state of the other, even if they are light-years apart.  This non-local correlation does not violate causality, as no information can be transmitted faster than light via entanglement.  Instead, it highlights the fundamental interconnectedness of quantum systems and the limitations of classical intuition in understanding their behavior.  The violation of Bell inequalities experimentally confirms the non-classical nature of entanglement, signifying a profound departure from the local realism paradigm underpinning classical physics.  Entanglement forms the basis for numerous quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
