Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The valence electrons of atoms, described by atomic orbitals, interact to form molecular orbitals (MOs) through the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approximation.  Constructive interference leads to bonding MOs, characterized by lower energy and increased electron density between nuclei, resulting in attractive forces. Destructive interference creates antibonding MOs, with higher energy and decreased electron density between nuclei, contributing to repulsion.

The arrangement of atoms within a molecule, its structure, is dictated by the interplay of these bonding and antibonding MOs.  Molecular geometry is optimized to minimize the total electronic energy, often predicted using computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT).  Hybridization of atomic orbitals, a crucial concept, explains the observed geometries of many molecules by allowing for the formation of equivalent hybrid orbitals with optimal directional properties.  Finally, the nature of the chemical bond (e.g., covalent, ionic, metallic) is qualitatively understood through the differing degrees of electron sharing or transfer between atoms, reflecting the relative energies and occupancy of the resulting MOs.
