Black hole formation represents a critical endpoint in stellar evolution, predicated upon exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.  This lecture will explore the two primary pathways: the collapse of massive stars and the accretion-induced collapse of white dwarfs.  In the first scenario, stars exceeding approximately eight solar masses exhaust their nuclear fuel, leading to core collapse.  The subsequent gravitational implosion overcomes neutron degeneracy pressure, resulting in a singularity and the formation of a black hole.  This process is characterized by a dramatic supernova explosion, although not all massive star collapses produce observable supernovae.  The second pathway involves white dwarfs in binary systems accreting mass from a companion star.  If the accumulated mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit,  the electron degeneracy pressure is overcome, triggering runaway collapse and black hole formation, often with weaker associated explosive events.  These contrasting mechanisms highlight the diverse astrophysical environments conducive to black hole formation, impacting galactic evolution and large-scale structure.  Further research focuses on the detailed modelling of these processes, encompassing general relativity and complex hydrodynamic simulations.
