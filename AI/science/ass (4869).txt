Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them promising candidates for a wide range of applications.  This presentation will explore the key properties that underpin their potential.  Their remarkable tensile strength, surpassing that of steel at a significantly lower density, is highlighted, along with their high Young's modulus, indicating exceptional stiffness.  The electrical conductivity of CNTs varies significantly depending on their chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, offering versatility in electronic device design.  Furthermore, their exceptionally high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation.

The unique combination of these properties translates into diverse practical applications. We will discuss their use in advanced composite materials, enhancing strength and durability in aerospace and automotive industries.  Their application in energy storage devices, such as high-capacity batteries and supercapacitors, will be reviewed, along with their potential for next-generation electronics, including field-effect transistors and transparent conducting films.  Finally, we will briefly address the challenges associated with CNT production, scalability, and functionalization, crucial for their widespread commercial adoption.  This presentation aims to provide an overview of the compelling properties and promising applications of CNTs, stimulating further research and development in this rapidly evolving field.
