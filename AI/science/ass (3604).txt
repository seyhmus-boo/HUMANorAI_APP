Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a subject of intense investigation despite decades of theoretical advancements.  While general relativity provides a robust framework for understanding black hole properties and evolution, directly observing the processes leading to their creation presents significant experimental challenges.  The extreme gravitational fields involved render traditional astronomical observation techniques insufficient.  The timescales of stellar collapse, often spanning mere seconds, demand high temporal resolution and sensitivity far exceeding current capabilities.  Furthermore, the obscuration of the formation process by dense circumstellar material necessitates observations across a wide range of electromagnetic wavelengths, including those heavily absorbed by intervening dust and gas.  This research focuses on exploring these experimental limitations. We analyze the current technological constraints limiting the direct observation of black hole formation from stellar collapse and the subsequent accretion disk development.  We then discuss promising future avenues, including the potential of gravitational wave astronomy, high-resolution X-ray and gamma-ray observations, and advanced computational modelling, to overcome these obstacles and ultimately provide a more complete empirical understanding of this fundamental astrophysical phenomenon.
