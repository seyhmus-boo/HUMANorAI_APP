Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, present significant experimental challenges.  Their unique cylindrical structure, exhibiting spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms, leads to high tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel.  However, precise measurement of these properties is hindered by difficulties in isolating individual, defect-free nanotubes and applying uniform stress during testing.  Similarly, the electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, is challenging to characterize accurately due to variations in nanotube structure within synthesized samples and the presence of impurities.  Precise control over chirality remains a significant synthetic hurdle, impacting the reproducibility of electrical measurements.  Furthermore, thermal conductivity measurements are complicated by the efficient heat dissipation along the nanotube axis, requiring advanced techniques to isolate and quantify this property accurately.  These experimental difficulties underscore the need for continued development of advanced characterization and synthesis methods to fully exploit the potential of CNTs.
