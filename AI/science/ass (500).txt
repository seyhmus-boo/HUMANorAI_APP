Good morning. Today's lecture concerns plasma physics phenomena, a field emerging from the late 19th-century study of ionized gases.  Early observations, such as cathode rays, hinted at the existence of a fourth state of matter distinct from solids, liquids, and gases.  However, it was Irving Langmuir who, in the 1920s, coined the term "plasma,"  describing the collective behavior of ionized particles.

Plasma physics encompasses a vast range of phenomena governed by the interplay of electromagnetic fields and charged particles.  Key characteristics include collective behavior, arising from long-range Coulomb interactions, and high electrical conductivity.  This leads to a diverse array of observable effects.  For instance, plasma waves, including Langmuir waves and ion-acoustic waves, propagate through the medium.  Furthermore,  instabilities, such as the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, can lead to turbulent behavior and complex structure formation.  These phenomena are crucial in understanding diverse astrophysical processes, controlled fusion research, and technological applications such as plasma processing.  We will explore specific examples in subsequent lectures.
