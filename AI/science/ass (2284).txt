Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles.  The strong nuclear force, responsible for binding nucleons (protons and neutrons), is a short-range, residual interaction arising from the underlying quantum chromodynamics.  Within the nucleus, nucleons occupy discrete quantum states dictated by the Pauli exclusion principle and the nuclear shell model.  The stability of a nucleus depends on a delicate balance between the strong force, which attracts nucleons, and the Coulomb repulsion between protons.  In heavy nuclei, the Coulomb repulsion becomes dominant, leading to a state of relatively high potential energy.

Fission occurs when a nucleus absorbs a neutron, promoting it to a higher energy state.  This added energy perturbs the delicate balance, overcoming the potential energy barrier that prevents spontaneous fission.  Quantum tunneling, a distinctly quantum phenomenon, allows the nucleus to penetrate this barrier even if its energy is insufficient to surmount it classically.  Once the barrier is penetrated, the nucleus rapidly deforms, ultimately undergoing scission into two or more fragments.  The released energy manifests as kinetic energy of the fragments and emission of neutrons, further sustaining a chain reaction under appropriate conditions.  The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics dictates the distribution of fission fragments and neutron yields.
