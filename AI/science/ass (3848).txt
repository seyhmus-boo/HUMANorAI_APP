Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for diverse technological applications.  However, realizing their full potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges. This presentation will focus on key limitations encountered during the synthesis, characterization, and processing of CNTs.  Specifically, we will address the challenges associated with controlling the chirality and diameter distribution during synthesis, leading to inconsistencies in material properties.  Furthermore, the precise characterization of CNT structure, including defects and impurities, remains a complex task, requiring advanced techniques such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, which often suffer from limitations in throughput and resolution.  The inherent tendency of CNTs to agglomerate presents significant obstacles to processing and integration into devices, necessitating sophisticated dispersion techniques and careful consideration of interfacial interactions.  Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss ongoing efforts to overcome these experimental hurdles and pave the way for the reliable and scalable fabrication of CNT-based devices.  This includes exploring novel synthesis methods, developing improved characterization techniques, and optimizing processing methodologies for improved control over CNT properties and integration.
