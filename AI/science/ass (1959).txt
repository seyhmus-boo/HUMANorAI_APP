Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, driving extensive research into their diverse applications. This presentation will review the fundamental properties of CNTs, including their high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity (ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality), and superior thermal conductivity.  We will discuss the impact of structural parameters like diameter, chirality, and defects on these properties.

Recent developments significantly advance CNT synthesis and characterization.  Advances in catalytic chemical vapor deposition techniques now allow for the controlled growth of high-purity, large-scale CNT arrays with precisely defined characteristics.  Furthermore, sophisticated characterization methods, such as advanced microscopy and spectroscopy, provide unprecedented insights into the atomic structure and electronic properties at the nanoscale, enabling refined control over CNT functionality.  We will highlight the progress in scalable production methods and their impact on cost-effectiveness, alongside recent breakthroughs in understanding the influence of doping and functionalization on CNT properties for enhanced application in fields such as composites, electronics, and energy storage. Finally, the presentation will briefly address remaining challenges and future research directions.
