Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized bonding.  Their exceptional tensile strength, surpassing that of steel by a significant margin, coupled with remarkable flexibility, makes them attractive for high-strength composite materials.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptionally high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of diamond in certain orientations, rendering them ideal for thermal management applications.  Their electrical properties are highly dependent on chirality and diameter, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, offering versatility in electronics. Recent developments have focused on controlled synthesis techniques, enabling precise manipulation of chirality and diameter distributions, leading to enhanced control over their electronic properties.  Furthermore, significant progress has been made in scalable production methods, reducing costs and paving the way for large-scale applications.  Research into functionalization strategies, aiming to improve CNT dispersibility in various matrices and introduce specific functionalities, is also rapidly advancing.  These advancements are driving the integration of CNTs into diverse fields, including advanced composites, energy storage devices, sensors, and biomedical applications.
