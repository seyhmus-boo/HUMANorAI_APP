Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition, describes a correlation between two or more quantum particles irrespective of the spatial separation between them.  This non-classical correlation manifests in the violation of Bell's inequalities, experimentally confirmed numerous times, thereby excluding local realism as a complete description of the quantum world.  The interdisciplinary significance of entanglement is profound.  In physics, it underpins quantum computing, enabling faster computation through entangled qubits and quantum teleportation.  Furthermore, it forms the basis of quantum cryptography, offering theoretically unbreakable encryption schemes.  Entanglement also bridges the gap between physics and information science, highlighting the fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics on information processing and communication.  Its implications extend to other fields:  in biology, entanglement's role in photosynthesis and avian magnetoreception is being actively explored, challenging classical explanations of these biological processes.  Ultimately, the exploration of entanglement compels a reassessment of our understanding of reality, spanning the boundaries of physics, computer science, and biology, prompting ongoing research at the forefront of scientific inquiry.
