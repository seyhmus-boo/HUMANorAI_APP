Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential across diverse technological applications. However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges related to their synthesis, characterization, and manipulation. This presentation will focus on these crucial experimental hurdles.  We will discuss the difficulties in achieving controlled synthesis of CNTs with desired chirality and structural perfection, highlighting the limitations of current techniques like CVD and arc discharge.  Furthermore, accurate characterization of CNT properties, including diameter, length, chirality, and defect density, remains a significant challenge, with techniques like Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy often providing limited or ambiguous data.  The inherent tendency of CNTs to agglomerate also poses a considerable processing challenge, hindering their dispersion in matrices for composite material applications and demanding sophisticated functionalization strategies.  Finally, we will briefly address the challenges associated with scalable and cost-effective production methods for high-quality CNTs, emphasizing the need for further research to overcome these experimental bottlenecks and unlock the full potential of these remarkable materials.
