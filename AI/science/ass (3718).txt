Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, are cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional material properties stemming from their unique sp² hybridized structure.  Their discovery revolutionized nanotechnology, opening avenues for diverse applications.  CNTs exist primarily as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) – a single graphene sheet rolled into a cylinder – and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) – concentrically nested SWNTs.

These properties are highly dependent on chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's roll), diameter, and length.  High tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, is a hallmark characteristic, coupled with remarkable flexibility and high aspect ratios.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving either as metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality.  Their thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, exceeding that of diamond in certain orientations.  Finally, their large surface area contributes to significant adsorption capabilities, promising applications in gas storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in controlling precise synthesis and scalable production for widespread technological implementation.  Ongoing research focuses on improving these aspects and further exploring the potential of CNTs in diverse fields.
