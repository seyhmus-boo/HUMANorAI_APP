DNA replication, a fundamental process in all life, presents significant experimental challenges despite decades of research.  This presentation will explore key hurdles in accurately studying this intricate mechanism, focusing on three primary areas. Firstly, the inherent complexity of the replisome, a multi-protein machine, makes isolating and characterizing individual components and their dynamic interactions incredibly difficult.  Traditional biochemical techniques often disrupt these delicate assemblies, leading to artifacts and incomplete understanding. Secondly, the high speed and processivity of DNA polymerases necessitates innovative approaches to capture transient intermediates and visualize replication in real-time.  Limitations in temporal resolution of current imaging techniques hinder a complete understanding of replication fork progression and stability. Finally, accurately studying replication in vivo presents challenges due to the crowded nature of the cellular environment and the involvement of numerous accessory factors whose roles are not fully elucidated.  This presentation will highlight recent advances in overcoming these challenges, including single-molecule techniques, advanced microscopy, and innovative in vitro reconstitution systems. By addressing these experimental limitations, we can further our understanding of DNA replication fidelity, regulation, and its role in genome stability and disease.
