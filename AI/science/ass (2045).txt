Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms, have captivated scientific interest since their discovery in 1991 by Iijima.  This presentation will explore the remarkable properties of these materials that underpin their potential for revolutionary applications.  We will discuss the two primary structural forms: single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNTs), highlighting the differences in their electronic and mechanical characteristics.

SWCNTs exhibit exceptional electronic properties, demonstrating metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality, offering possibilities for advanced electronics and optoelectronics.  MWCNTs, with their concentric cylindrical structure, boast remarkable mechanical strength and stiffness, surpassing that of steel, making them ideal candidates for reinforcing composites.  The presentation will further address the unique thermal conductivity of CNTs, significantly higher than copper, promising advancements in thermal management technologies.

Furthermore, the significant surface area of CNTs allows for functionalization and modification, expanding their application potential in areas such as energy storage, catalysis, and biomedical engineering.  Challenges remain, including scalable, cost-effective production and dispersion techniques, which will also be briefly discussed.  Finally, we will conclude with an overview of current research directions and future prospects for CNT-based technologies.
