The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime with such intense gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical work, stemming from John Michell's and Pierre-Simon Laplace's 18th-century musings on "dark stars,"  laid the groundwork for the concept.  However, the rigorous theoretical framework emerged only with Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the early 20th century, which predicted the existence of black holes as a consequence of gravitational collapse.  Karl Schwarzschild's solution to Einstein's field equations further solidified this prediction, defining the event horizon, the point of no return.  Observationally, the existence of black holes wasn't directly confirmed until much later.  The identification of Cygnus X-1 as a strong candidate in the 1970s, exhibiting properties consistent with a stellar-mass black hole, marked a significant milestone.  Currently, the accepted model posits that stellar-mass black holes form from the gravitational collapse of massive stars at the end of their lifecycle, while supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, likely originate through a combination of processes, potentially including the merging of smaller black holes and direct collapse of massive gas clouds.  The precise details of black hole formation across different mass scales remain an area of active research.
