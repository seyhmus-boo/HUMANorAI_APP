Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 through transmission electron microscopy, exhibit a unique combination of properties stemming from their exceptional structure.  These cylindrical structures, composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), the latter comprising concentrically nested SWNTs.  Their remarkable mechanical properties include exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, surpassing that of steel. This is attributed to the strong covalent bonds within the graphitic sheets and their highly ordered structure.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving either as metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality (the helical arrangement of the carbon atoms).  Their high aspect ratio and large surface area lead to significant applications in diverse fields. Thermal conductivity is also noteworthy, with CNTs exhibiting high values, rendering them suitable for thermal management applications. However, challenges remain in their large-scale, cost-effective production and in controlling their precise structural parameters for specific applications.
