Catalysts, substances that accelerate reaction rates without being consumed, are indispensable in organic chemistry.  Their historical significance dates back to the early 19th century, with Berzelius's initial recognition of "catalytic force."  However, a mechanistic understanding only emerged much later.  In organic synthesis, catalysts selectively enhance the rate of specific transformations by lowering the activation energy of the reaction.  This occurs through the formation of transient intermediates, often involving catalyst-substrate complexes, which alter the reaction pathway to one with a lower energy barrier.

Catalysts can be broadly classified as homogeneous (existing in the same phase as the reactants, e.g., transition metal complexes in solution) and heterogeneous (a different phase, e.g., solid-supported metal nanoparticles).  Homogeneous catalysts frequently exhibit high selectivity, owing to precise control over the reaction environment at a molecular level.  Conversely, heterogeneous catalysts offer advantages in terms of ease of separation and recyclability.  Advances in catalyst design, focusing on principles of structure-activity relationships, now allow for the development of highly efficient and selective catalysts, driving innovation in numerous fields, including pharmaceuticals and materials science.
