Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns chemical bonding and its influence on molecular structure, a cornerstone of chemistry.  Atoms achieve stability by forming chemical bonds, primarily through the sharing or transfer of electrons.  Covalent bonds, formed by electron sharing, lead to molecules with defined three-dimensional structures dictated by factors like bond angles and lengths. These structures profoundly impact a molecule's properties. For instance, the tetrahedral structure of methane (CH₄) contrasts sharply with the linear structure of carbon dioxide (CO₂), resulting in vastly different physical and chemical behaviours.  Ionic bonds, conversely, arise from electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions.  Understanding these bonding principles is crucial for predicting material properties.  For example, the strong covalent bonds in diamond contribute to its exceptional hardness, making it ideal for industrial applications, while the weaker intermolecular forces in water contribute to its unique solvent properties essential for biological systems.  In essence, the interplay of bonding and structure is paramount to understanding and manipulating the macroscopic properties of substances.
