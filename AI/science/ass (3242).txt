Good morning. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a pivotal process in astrophysics.  Black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses under its own immense gravity.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit – approximately three solar masses –  further collapse is inevitable, leading to a singularity, a point of infinite density.  This singularity is shrouded by an event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

While observing black holes directly is challenging, their gravitational influence on surrounding matter allows for detection via methods like gravitational lensing and observation of accretion disks.  Understanding black hole formation is crucial for advancing our comprehension of galactic evolution and large-scale structure.  Practically, the study of black holes informs the development of advanced gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, enhancing our ability to observe these cataclysmic events and potentially unlock further insights into the fundamental laws of physics, including quantum gravity.  Further research into black hole thermodynamics may also contribute to theoretical developments in information theory and potentially even energy production in the distant future.
