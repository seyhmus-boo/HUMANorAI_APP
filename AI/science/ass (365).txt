Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on catalysts in organic chemistry.  Imagine a mountain pass: reactants are climbers attempting to reach the product summit.  The activation energy represents the arduous climb over the mountain.  Catalysts, however, are like skilled guides, providing alternative, less strenuous routes. They don't alter the overall energy difference between reactants and products—the height of the mountain remains the same—but they drastically reduce the activation energy, making the climb significantly easier and faster.

This is achieved by forming temporary intermediates with the reactants, thereby creating lower-energy transition states. Think of it as the guide providing temporary handholds and footholds along a less steep path.  Catalysts are not consumed in the reaction; once the climbers (reactants) have reached the summit (products), the guide (catalyst) remains unchanged and is free to assist other climbers.  This crucial property allows for minute quantities of catalyst to effect substantial reaction rate enhancements, making them invaluable tools in organic synthesis.
