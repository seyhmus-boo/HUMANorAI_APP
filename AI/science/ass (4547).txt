Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them promising materials for diverse applications.  Their unique structure, consisting of seamlessly rolled graphene sheets, results in exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, surpassing those of steel.  Depending on chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's roll), CNTs can exhibit metallic or semiconducting behavior, offering potential for advanced electronics.  Their high aspect ratio and surface area contribute to excellent thermal conductivity, suitable for thermal management applications.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT synthesis to achieve desired chirality and purity, and in effectively dispersing them within composite materials to fully exploit their properties.  Significant progress has been made in scalable production methods, including chemical vapor deposition and arc discharge, but further research is needed to address challenges related to cost-effectiveness, scalability, and toxicological concerns for widespread industrial adoption.  Ongoing research focuses on enhancing functionalization strategies to improve compatibility and tailoring their properties for specific applications, paving the way for revolutionary advancements in materials science and engineering.
