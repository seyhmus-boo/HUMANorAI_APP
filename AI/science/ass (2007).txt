Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the experimental challenges inherent in elucidating chemical bonding and molecular structure.  While theoretical models provide valuable insights, experimental verification remains crucial. Determining bond lengths and angles, for instance, presents significant hurdles.  X-ray diffraction, a powerful technique, requires crystalline samples, limiting its applicability to amorphous materials.  Furthermore, data interpretation can be complex, particularly for large molecules with numerous atoms.  NMR spectroscopy, while providing valuable information on connectivity and environment, faces challenges with signal overlap and the need for isotopic enrichment in certain cases.  Electron diffraction, useful for gas-phase structures, struggles with accuracy at lower resolution.  Finally, even with advanced techniques, achieving sufficient resolution to unambiguously determine the precise 3D structure of complex molecules, especially those exhibiting conformational flexibility, often proves experimentally demanding and necessitates the convergence of multiple methods for robust conclusion.  These experimental limitations continually drive the development of novel techniques and sophisticated analytical approaches.
