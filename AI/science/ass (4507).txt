DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring the faithful transmission of genetic information, is characterized by a semi-conservative mechanism.  Initiation involves the unwinding of the parental double helix at specific origin sites by helicases, aided by single-strand binding proteins which prevent re-annealing.  This unwinding generates a replication fork, a Y-shaped structure where DNA synthesis occurs bidirectionally.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH terminus required by DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for the processive elongation of the leading and lagging strands.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase then seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, generating a continuous lagging strand.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity inherent to DNA polymerases and a complex network of repair mechanisms that address errors introduced during replication.  The overall process is tightly regulated, ensuring accurate and efficient duplication of the genome prior to cell division.
