DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring genetic inheritance, presents significant experimental challenges despite decades of research.  This presentation will focus on key hurdles encountered in studying this intricate process *in vivo* and *in vitro*.  High-fidelity replication demands precise coordination of numerous proteins, making it difficult to dissect individual contributions and identify rate-limiting steps.  Furthermore, the dynamic nature of replication forks, their susceptibility to stalling and collapse, and the involvement of complex repair mechanisms necessitate advanced time-resolved imaging and single-molecule techniques.  Studying eukaryotic replication is further complicated by the organization of DNA into chromatin, influencing accessibility and replication timing. We will discuss the limitations of current experimental approaches, including the difficulty in faithfully recapitulating the *in vivo* environment *in vitro*, and the challenges in observing transient intermediate states.  Finally, we will highlight emerging technologies, such as advanced microscopy and single-cell sequencing, which promise to overcome some of these limitations and provide a more comprehensive understanding of DNA replication fidelity and dynamics.
