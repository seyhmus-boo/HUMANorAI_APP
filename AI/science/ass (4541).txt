The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime with gravity so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical work by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, utilizing Einstein's general theory of relativity, predicted the existence of these objects as solutions to the field equations.  However, their actual existence remained highly speculative for decades.

The prevailing understanding posits that stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (≥25 solar masses).  When such a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, the inward gravitational force overwhelms the outward pressure, leading to a catastrophic implosion.  If the remaining core mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), even neutron degeneracy pressure cannot prevent further collapse, resulting in the formation of a singularity surrounded by an event horizon.

Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, present a greater enigma.  While their formation likely involves the collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe, the exact mechanisms, potentially including mergers of smaller black holes and direct collapse scenarios, remain areas of active research.  Observational evidence, including gravitational waves and the dynamics of orbiting stars, strongly supports the existence of both stellar and supermassive black holes, solidifying their place as fundamental components of the cosmos.
