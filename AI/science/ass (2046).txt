Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  This abstract summarizes the quantum mechanical description of these phenomena, focusing on the role of electronic wavefunctions. The formation of chemical bonds arises from the lowering of the total electronic energy upon interaction of atoms, which can be analyzed through the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approach to construct molecular orbitals.  Bonding orbitals, characterized by constructive interference of atomic orbitals, concentrate electron density between nuclei, leading to attractive forces. Conversely, antibonding orbitals, resulting from destructive interference, increase electronic energy and destabilize the molecule.  Molecular geometry is determined by the minimization of the total energy, including electron-electron, electron-nuclear, and nuclear-nuclear interactions, often computed using methods like Hartree-Fock or Density Functional Theory (DFT).  The concept of hybridization further explains the observed geometries of many molecules by accounting for the mixing of atomic orbitals to form optimally oriented hybrid orbitals for bonding.  Ultimately, the detailed shape and properties of molecules are precisely described by their electronic wavefunctions, providing a powerful framework for understanding and predicting chemical reactivity.  Future advances in computational quantum chemistry will continue to refine our understanding of these fundamental concepts.
