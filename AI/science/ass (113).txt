Catalysts underpin numerous advancements in organic chemistry, enabling efficient and selective transformations otherwise unattainable under conventional conditions. This presentation surveys the diverse landscape of catalytic methodologies employed in modern organic synthesis, highlighting recent breakthroughs and emerging trends.  We will explore the pivotal roles of various catalyst types, encompassing transition metal complexes (e.g., Pd, Ru, Ni), organocatalysts (e.g., proline, imidazolium salts), and biocatalysts (e.g., enzymes).  The discussion will encompass key catalytic cycles, emphasizing mechanistic understanding crucial for catalyst design and optimization.  Specific examples will illustrate the application of these catalysts in the synthesis of complex molecules, including pharmaceuticals and natural products, with a focus on strategies for achieving improved atom economy, reduced waste generation, and enhanced enantioselectivity. Finally, we will briefly address the ongoing challenges and future directions in catalyst development, such as the pursuit of sustainable and readily accessible catalytic systems, and the integration of AI-driven catalyst design approaches.  This presentation aims to provide an overview of the field for both specialists and those new to catalysis in organic chemistry.
