DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring genetic continuity, proceeds via a semiconservative mechanism, whereby each newly synthesized double helix retains one parental strand.  This process is initiated at specific origins of replication, unwound by helicases and stabilized by single-strand binding proteins.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH terminus for DNA polymerase III, the principal enzyme responsible for leading and lagging strand synthesis.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase then seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, creating a continuous lagging strand.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity inherent to DNA polymerases, as well as post-replicative mismatch repair mechanisms.  Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, present a unique challenge to replication, requiring the action of telomerase to prevent shortening and genomic instability.  Dysregulation of DNA replication is implicated in various diseases, highlighting the critical role of this process in maintaining genome integrity.
