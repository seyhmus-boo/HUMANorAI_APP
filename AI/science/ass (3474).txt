Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter fragments, is a complex process fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The phenomenon is initiated by overcoming the Coulomb barrier between nucleons, a process significantly influenced by tunneling probabilities described by quantum tunneling theory.  The collective nuclear motion, crucial for fission, is often modeled using the liquid drop model, although this classical approach necessitates quantum corrections to account for shell effects and deformation-dependent potential energies.  The precise pathways and fragment mass distributions are determined by the interplay of strong and weak nuclear forces, described by sophisticated many-body quantum Hamiltonians often requiring approximations such as the mean-field theory or shell model.  The emission of neutrons, a defining characteristic of fission, arises from the excited states of the nascent fragments, the decay probability of which is dictated by quantum mechanical decay rates.  Furthermore, the spontaneous fission phenomenon highlights the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanical decay, with the half-life dictated by the tunneling probability through the fission barrier.  Advancements in theoretical nuclear physics continue to improve our understanding of the intricate quantum mechanical mechanisms governing this fundamental process, with implications for nuclear energy and security.
