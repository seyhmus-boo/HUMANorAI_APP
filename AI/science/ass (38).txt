Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential for diverse technological applications.  However, realizing this potential is hindered by significant experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains a major obstacle, with current methods often yielding heterogeneous mixtures of chiralities, diameters, and lengths, complicating characterization and reproducibility.  Accurate determination of individual CNT properties is further complicated by strong van der Waals interactions leading to bundling, necessitating complex dispersion and individualization techniques.  Moreover,  reliable and efficient functionalization strategies for tailoring CNT surface chemistry remain an active area of research,  as achieving uniform functionalization without compromising intrinsic properties is difficult.  Advanced characterization techniques, such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy, are crucial but often insufficient to fully resolve structural complexities and defect densities.  Overcoming these experimental limitations through the development of improved synthesis methods, advanced separation techniques, and refined characterization protocols is paramount for the advancement of CNT-based technologies.
