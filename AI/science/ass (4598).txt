Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, possess a unique combination of properties driving extensive interdisciplinary research.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel at a significantly lower density, is exploited in materials science for composites and reinforcement applications.  Furthermore, their high electrical conductivity, tunable depending on chirality, finds applications in electronics, from transistors to transparent conductive films, bridging the gap between materials science and electrical engineering.  

Remarkably, CNTs exhibit exceptional thermal conductivity, making them ideal for thermal management systems in diverse fields like aerospace and microelectronics.  Their large surface area also holds significant promise in chemistry and environmental science, enabling applications in catalysis, gas storage, and water purification.  Biomedical engineering leverages their biocompatibility (depending on functionalization) for drug delivery systems and biosensors, illustrating the diverse potential of CNTs across disciplines.  However, challenges remain regarding scalable, cost-effective production and addressing potential toxicity concerns before widespread implementation can be fully realized.  Ongoing interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for overcoming these challenges and harnessing the full potential of this remarkable material.
