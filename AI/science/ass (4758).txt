DNA replication, the fundamental process by which genetic information is duplicated, is a cornerstone of molecular biology.  However, understanding its intricate mechanisms requires an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon insights from diverse fields beyond traditional biochemistry and genetics. This research paper explores the multifaceted nature of DNA replication, highlighting the crucial contributions of physics, mathematics, and computer science.  The fidelity of replication, crucial for genomic stability, is influenced by physical forces governing the interactions between DNA polymerase and its substrate, an area requiring sophisticated biophysical techniques and modelling.  Furthermore, the complex kinetics of replication fork progression, involving numerous protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions, necessitates mathematical modelling to unravel the underlying dynamics and predict the impact of perturbations.  The sheer volume of sequence data generated by next-generation sequencing has rendered bioinformatics and computational biology indispensable for analyzing replication timing, identifying origins of replication, and understanding the complex interplay between replication and other cellular processes.  This paper will integrate these interdisciplinary perspectives to provide a holistic understanding of DNA replication, highlighting both established knowledge and current research frontiers.
