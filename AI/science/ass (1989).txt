Catalysts are indispensable in organic chemistry, enabling reactions that would otherwise be kinetically inaccessible.  This presentation will explore the role of catalysts from a quantum mechanical perspective, focusing on how computational methods illuminate the mechanistic details governing their activity and selectivity.  We will examine how density functional theory (DFT) and wavefunction-based methods are employed to elucidate reaction pathways, identify transition states, and quantify activation barriers.  Specific examples will highlight the importance of catalyst-substrate interactions, including orbital interactions and charge transfer phenomena, in determining reaction outcomes.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss how computational studies can guide the rational design of novel catalysts with enhanced performance. By analyzing electronic structure and energetic profiles, we can predict catalytic activity and selectivity, providing valuable insights for experimental synthesis and optimization.  This interdisciplinary approach combining theory and experiment accelerates the discovery and development of efficient and sustainable catalytic processes in organic chemistry.
