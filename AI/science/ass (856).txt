Black hole formation remains a captivating area of astrophysics, bridging theoretical predictions with observational astronomy. This presentation will explore the diverse pathways leading to black hole creation, focusing on stellar-mass black holes resulting from core-collapse supernovae and supermassive black holes residing at galactic centers. We will examine the critical role of stellar mass and metallicity in determining the final fate of massive stars, highlighting the complexities of progenitor evolution and the limitations of current modelling techniques. The formation mechanisms of supermassive black holes, involving direct collapse or the merger of stellar-mass black holes, will also be discussed, acknowledging ongoing debates concerning their seeding and growth.  Finally, the presentation will touch upon practical applications arising from this research.  Understanding black hole formation enhances our ability to interpret gravitational wave signals, crucial for refining models of stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. Moreover, advancements in this field are informing the development of more accurate astrophysical simulations, improving our capacity to model galactic evolution and predict the future behavior of our own galaxy.  The knowledge gained impacts our comprehension of the universe's structure and evolution at its most extreme scales.
