Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems regardless of the spatial separation.  This correlation surpasses classical physics, exhibiting non-local correlations that violate Bell's inequalities.  Recent developments significantly advance our understanding and application of entanglement.  Advances in quantum computing leverage entangled qubits for enhanced computational power, surpassing classical algorithms in specific tasks.  Experimental breakthroughs demonstrate increasingly sophisticated control over entangled systems, with the creation of large-scale entangled states and the development of robust entanglement distribution protocols through various channels, including optical fibers and free space.  Furthermore,  research into the fundamental nature of entanglement continues, exploring its connection to quantum gravity and probing the boundaries of locality.  The burgeoning field of quantum metrology also utilizes entangled states to achieve unprecedented precision in measurement, promising advancements in areas like sensing and imaging. Despite ongoing theoretical and experimental challenges, quantum entanglement's potential across diverse scientific and technological domains solidifies its position as a cornerstone of modern physics.
