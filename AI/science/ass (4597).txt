Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  The process, first observed experimentally by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and theoretically explained by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, involves the bombardment of fissile isotopes, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, with neutrons.  This interaction induces instability, causing the nucleus to fission, releasing a significant amount of energy in accordance with Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  The fission process also yields further neutrons, creating the possibility of a chain reaction, a phenomenon crucial to the development of nuclear weapons and nuclear power reactors.  Different fission pathways exist, producing varying amounts of energy and a spectrum of radioactive fission products, posing challenges for nuclear waste management.  Subsequent research extensively explored the physics of fission, leading to the development of sophisticated models to predict fission yields and neutron emission probabilities, essential for reactor design and safety.  Continued investigation focuses on improving the efficiency and safety of nuclear fission technology while mitigating its environmental impact.
