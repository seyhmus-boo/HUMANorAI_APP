Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for diverse applications.  However, realizing this potential is significantly hampered by experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains a major hurdle, with current methods yielding heterogeneous mixtures of different chiralities, diameters, and lengths, impacting reproducibility and performance.  Characterizing these complex mixtures presents another significant challenge. While techniques like Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy provide valuable insights, accurately determining the precise structure and properties of individual nanotubes within a sample remains difficult.  Furthermore, efficient purification and dispersion of CNTs in various matrices are crucial yet problematic.  Agglomeration due to strong van der Waals forces hinders their effective use in composites and devices.  Finally, scaling up CNT production to meet industrial demands while maintaining consistent quality remains a significant obstacle.  Overcoming these experimental challenges through advancements in synthesis, characterization, and processing techniques is crucial for unlocking the full potential of carbon nanotubes.
