Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei, remains a pivotal energy source and a subject of ongoing research. This presentation will provide an overview of fundamental fission processes, emphasizing the interplay between neutron interactions, nuclear structure, and fission fragment yields.  We will explore the intricacies of different fissionable isotopes, particularly uranium and plutonium, and discuss the factors influencing their fission characteristics, including neutron energy and isotopic composition.

Recent advancements in the field will be highlighted, focusing on improved theoretical modeling capabilities that enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics involved.  Specific attention will be paid to the development of sophisticated Monte Carlo simulations and data-driven approaches, enabling more accurate predictions of fission cross-sections and prompt neutron emission.  Furthermore, the presentation will touch upon emerging research into innovative reactor designs, such as Generation IV reactors, which aim to improve safety, efficiency, and waste management through advanced fuel cycles and reactor concepts that utilize the unique properties of different fissionable isotopes.  The implications of these developments for future energy production and nuclear waste management will be briefly discussed.
