DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating a DNA molecule, remains a central tenet of molecular biology.  The process, initiated at origins of replication, involves unwinding of the double helix by helicases, stabilized by single-stranded binding proteins.  Leading and lagging strand synthesis, catalyzed by DNA polymerase, proceeds in a 5' to 3' direction, with the lagging strand synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, subsequently removed and replaced by DNA polymerase I.  DNA ligase seals the resulting nicks, ensuring a continuous, replicated strand.

Recent developments have significantly enhanced our understanding of this fundamental process.  High-throughput sequencing technologies allow for detailed analysis of replication dynamics, revealing replication timing and origin usage variations across the genome.  Moreover, advancements in cryo-electron microscopy are providing unprecedented structural insights into the replisome, a multi-protein complex orchestrating replication, clarifying the interplay between different enzymes and accessory proteins.  Studies investigating the regulation of replication initiation and fidelity, particularly in the context of cancer and ageing, represent active areas of current research, continually refining our understanding of this crucial biological mechanism.
