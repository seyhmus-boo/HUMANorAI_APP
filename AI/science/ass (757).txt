DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring genetic inheritance, proceeds via a semi-conservative mechanism, whereby each daughter duplex retains one parental strand.  Initiation involves the assembly of the pre-replication complex at origins of replication, unwinding the DNA helix via helicases and stabilizing the separated strands with single-strand binding proteins.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for leading and lagging strand synthesis.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase seals the resultant nicks, creating a continuous lagging strand.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity inherent in DNA polymerases, as well as mismatch repair pathways that correct errors post-replication.  Telomeres, repetitive sequences at chromosome ends, present a unique challenge due to the inability of DNA polymerase to replicate the 5' end of the lagging strand, leading to shortening with each replication cycle, addressed by telomerase in germ cells and some somatic cells.  Disruptions in these intricate mechanisms can lead to genomic instability and disease.
