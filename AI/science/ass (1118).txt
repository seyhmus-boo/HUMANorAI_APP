DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  This presentation will provide an overview of the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying this critical process, focusing on the interplay between key enzymes and proteins.  We will begin by examining the initiation phase, including origin recognition, unwinding of the DNA double helix by helicases, and the stabilization of single-stranded DNA by single-stranded binding proteins.  Subsequently, the elongation phase will be discussed, emphasizing the role of DNA polymerases in synthesizing new DNA strands in a 5' to 3' direction, the creation of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand, and the involvement of primase and ligase.  The crucial role of proofreading mechanisms in maintaining genomic integrity will also be highlighted, including the exonuclease activity of certain DNA polymerases. Finally, we will briefly address the termination phase and the complexities of replication in eukaryotic cells, including the coordination of replication on multiple chromosomes.  The presentation aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive understanding of DNA replication, its regulation, and its importance in cell division and heredity.
