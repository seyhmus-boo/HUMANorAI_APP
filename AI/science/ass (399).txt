Black hole formation remains a cornerstone of astrophysical research, posing both theoretical and observational challenges.  While the theoretical framework of general relativity provides a robust description of black holes as singularities, the precise mechanisms leading to their formation in diverse astrophysical environments continue to be refined. This paper explores recent developments in our understanding of black hole genesis, moving beyond the classic picture of stellar collapse.  We examine advancements in numerical relativity, allowing for increasingly accurate simulations of binary black hole mergers and the resulting gravitational wave emission â€“ events now routinely detected by observatories like LIGO and Virgo.  Furthermore, we consider the growing body of evidence concerning the formation of supermassive black holes, including the role of direct collapse, hierarchical mergers, and the influence of active galactic nuclei feedback. Recent observations, particularly high-resolution imaging techniques and advancements in multi-messenger astronomy, are revolutionizing our perspective. This paper will synthesize these recent findings, highlighting the key uncertainties and outstanding questions that remain central to the ongoing pursuit of a complete understanding of black hole formation across the cosmic mass spectrum.
