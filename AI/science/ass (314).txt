Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, remains a fertile area of interdisciplinary research. This presentation explores the diverse pathways leading to black hole creation, emphasizing the crucial interplay between astrophysical observations, theoretical modelling, and computational techniques. We will examine the stellar-mass black hole formation pathway, focusing on the collapse of massive stars and the role of stellar evolution and supernovae.  The complexities of binary stellar systems and their contribution to black hole mergers, detectable through gravitational waves, will also be discussed.  Furthermore, the formation of supermassive black holes, residing at the centers of galaxies, remains a significant challenge. We will highlight recent advancements connecting their growth to galaxy evolution, active galactic nuclei feedback, and the cosmological distribution of dark matter.  Bridging these scales requires sophisticated numerical simulations incorporating general relativity, magnetohydrodynamics, and radiative transfer.  Finally, we will briefly address the open questions remaining in this field, particularly regarding the early universe's role in seeding supermassive black holes, underscoring the continued need for interdisciplinary collaboration to unravel the mysteries surrounding black hole formation across cosmic timescales.
