Black hole formation, a dramatic culmination of stellar evolution, arises from the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars.  Imagine a colossal, incandescent ball of gas – a star – perpetually battling its own immense gravity with the outward pressure generated by nuclear fusion.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, this internal pressure weakens, akin to the air leaking from a balloon.  For stars exceeding a certain critical mass (roughly three times the Sun's), the ensuing gravitational pull becomes overwhelmingly dominant, initiating an irreversible implosion.  This collapse is not uniform; the core collapses first, forming an incredibly dense singularity – a point of infinite density – around which spacetime becomes severely warped.  The outer layers of the star then cascade inward, sometimes resulting in a spectacular supernova explosion – a cosmic firework display signifying the final throes of the star's life.  The remaining core, now possessing gravity so strong that not even light can escape, constitutes a black hole.  This process is conceptually similar to squeezing a water balloon until it bursts, with the water representing the star's matter and the point where the burst occurs analogous to the formation of the singularity.  The intense gravity of the singularity then “traps” the surrounding space and time.
