Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, is fundamental to life on Earth.  Early understanding of the process, dating back to the 17th century with Jan Baptista van Helmont's experiments on willow trees, initially focused on the role of water.  However, it wasn't until the 19th century that the contribution of carbon dioxide was definitively established by Jean Senebier and Nicolas-Th√©odore de Saussure.  The crucial role of light was further elucidated with the demonstration that chlorophyll, the green pigment in plants, absorbs light energy.  The 20th century saw the unraveling of the complex biochemical pathways.  Photosynthesis occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle).  In the light-dependent reactions, photons are absorbed by chlorophyll, exciting electrons and driving the synthesis of ATP and NADPH.  These energy-carrying molecules then fuel the light-independent reactions, where carbon dioxide is fixed into organic molecules, primarily glucose, via a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  This elegant interplay of light absorption, electron transport, and carbon fixation sustains the biosphere's primary productivity.
