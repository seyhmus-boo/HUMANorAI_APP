Understanding chemical bonding and molecular structure is crucial in chemistry, yet experimental determination presents significant challenges.  Diffraction techniques, such as X-ray and neutron diffraction, while powerful for elucidating solid-state structures, face limitations with disordered or amorphous materials, requiring sophisticated data analysis and modelling to overcome ambiguities.  Similarly, spectroscopic methods, including NMR and IR, provide valuable information about functional groups and molecular connectivity, but spectral interpretation can be complex, especially in large or highly symmetrical molecules, necessitating the use of advanced computational methods for peak assignment and structural elucidation.

Furthermore,  studying molecules in their native environments, such as in solution or in biological systems, poses further difficulties.  Solution-phase techniques often lack the atomic-level resolution afforded by solid-state methods, while in vivo studies present challenges related to sensitivity and the complex interplay of various biomolecules.  Finally, the synthesis and purification of sufficient quantities of target molecules for analysis, particularly for novel or unstable compounds, remains a considerable hurdle, often limiting the scope of experimental investigations.  Overcoming these challenges necessitates the integration of multiple experimental techniques and advanced computational modelling to gain a comprehensive understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure.
