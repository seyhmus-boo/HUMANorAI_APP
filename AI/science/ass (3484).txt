Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, with recent advancements refining our understanding of the diverse pathways leading to these enigmatic objects.  Stellar-mass black holes, resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, are now being extensively studied through gravitational wave observations, providing unprecedented insights into their mergers and the properties of their progenitor stars.  The detection of these events has spurred significant advancements in numerical relativity, allowing for more accurate modeling of the collapse process and the emission of gravitational waves.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, present a more complex origin story.  While direct collapse of massive gas clouds remains a plausible mechanism, recent simulations suggest a significant role for mergers and accretion of stellar-mass black holes, with the hierarchical growth model gaining traction.  Furthermore, intermediate-mass black holes, bridging the gap between stellar and supermassive black holes, are becoming increasingly well-documented, challenging traditional binary black hole merger scenarios and suggesting alternative formation pathways such as dense stellar clusters.  Ongoing and future multi-messenger observations, combined with increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations, promise to further illuminate the diverse processes governing black hole formation across cosmic scales.
