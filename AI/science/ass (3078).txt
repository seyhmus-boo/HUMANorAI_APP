Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition.  Consider two quantum systems, A and B, prepared in an entangled state.  This state cannot be factored into independent states for A and B; their descriptions are intrinsically linked, regardless of spatial separation.  Mathematically, this manifests as a superposition state, expressible as a linear combination of product states,  e.g.,  α|0⟩<sub>A</sub>|1⟩<sub>B</sub> + β|1⟩<sub>A</sub>|0⟩<sub>B</sub>, where α and β are complex amplitudes.

Crucially, measuring a property of system A instantaneously determines the corresponding correlated property of system B, even if they are light-years apart. This does not violate special relativity as no information is transmitted faster than light; the correlation is pre-established in the entangled state.  The observed outcome on A is probabilistic, dictated by |α|² and |β|², but the outcome on B is then definitively known.  This non-local correlation is a fundamental feature of quantum mechanics, a departure from classical locality and a keystone for quantum information science.
