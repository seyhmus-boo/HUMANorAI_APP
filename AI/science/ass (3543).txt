Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, represents a pivotal advancement in nuclear physics and technology.  Its discovery, originating from the work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, confirming Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch's theoretical interpretation, revolutionized our understanding of nuclear forces and unleashed immense energy.  This process, primarily driven by neutron bombardment of fissile isotopes like Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, releases a significant quantity of energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²), primarily in the form of kinetic energy of fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  These neutrons can subsequently induce further fission events, leading to a chain reaction, the basis of nuclear reactors and weapons.  Subsequent research elucidated the complex interplay of nuclear forces governing fission dynamics, including the roles of nuclear shell structure, deformation, and the various decay modes of fission fragments.  Controlled fission in nuclear reactors provides a significant source of electricity globally, while uncontrolled chain reactions underpin nuclear weaponry, highlighting both the immense potential and inherent dangers of this process.  Further research focuses on improving reactor safety, developing advanced reactor designs, and managing nuclear waste.
