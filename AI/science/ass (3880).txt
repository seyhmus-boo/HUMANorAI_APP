Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamental concepts underpinning our understanding of matter's physical and chemical properties.  This research explores the interplay between these concepts, focusing on the relationship between the electronic structure of atoms and the resulting geometric arrangements and properties of molecules. We examine the prevalent bonding models, including valence bond theory (VBT) and molecular orbital theory (MOT), evaluating their strengths and limitations in predicting and explaining molecular geometries, bond lengths, bond energies, and reactivity.  The impact of hybridization, resonance, and intermolecular forces on overall molecular structure and stability is also investigated.  This study critically analyzes the application of these theories to diverse molecular systems, ranging from simple diatomic molecules to complex organic and inorganic compounds. We demonstrate how computational chemistry techniques, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), can provide valuable insights into intricate bonding scenarios beyond the reach of simplified models.  Ultimately, this research aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the theoretical frameworks and computational methods employed in deciphering the intricate connection between chemical bonding and the resultant molecular architecture, highlighting both established principles and emerging areas of investigation within this crucial field.
