Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into smaller nuclei.  Imagine a carefully balanced, highly unstable Jenga tower representing the nucleus.  This tower, held together by the strong nuclear force, is inherently precarious.  Introducing a neutron, analogous to a slight nudge, disrupts the equilibrium.  This nudge causes the tower to collapse, not gradually, but catastrophically.  The resulting "collapse" is the fission event, where the large nucleus fractures into smaller, more stable nuclei, akin to the Jenga blocks separating into smaller stacks.

This collapse releases a significant amount of energy, comparable to suddenly releasing the potential energy stored in a tightly wound spring.  This energy manifests in two primary ways: kinetic energy of the newly formed fragments (the smaller Jenga stacks flying apart) and the emission of further neutrons (additional nudges capable of initiating a chain reaction).  This chain reaction is analogous to a domino effect, where each falling domino (neutron) triggers the collapse of multiple others (further fission events), leading to a rapid release of immense energy unless carefully controlled.  The overall process is therefore a cascading release of nuclear binding energy, transforming mass into energy as dictated by Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².
