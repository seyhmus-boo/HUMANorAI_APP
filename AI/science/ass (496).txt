Nuclear fission, the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in the history of science and technology.  Its unveiling, initiated by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann's serendipitous observation of barium isotopes in 1938, following neutron bombardment of uranium, marked a paradigm shift in our understanding of nuclear physics.  Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch subsequently provided the theoretical explanation, identifying the immense energy release inherent in this process, a consequence of the mass defect as described by Einstein's theory of relativity.  This groundbreaking work, initially met with skepticism, rapidly catapulted nuclear fission to the forefront of scientific inquiry, with its implications immediately recognized for both destructive and constructive applications.  The subsequent development of the atomic bomb during World War II tragically demonstrated the devastating power of uncontrolled fission, while concurrently highlighting the potential for harnessing this energy for peaceful purposes.  This paper delves into the fundamental mechanisms of nuclear fission, exploring the intricacies of criticality, different fissionable isotopes, and the various factors influencing fission yields and energy release.  Furthermore, it will examine the ongoing relevance of fission in modern nuclear energy production and its future prospects in the context of global energy demands and sustainable development.
