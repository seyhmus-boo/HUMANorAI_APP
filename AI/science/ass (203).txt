Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition.  Initially theorized by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in 1935 as a purported flaw in quantum mechanics, entanglement describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems.  These systems, regardless of spatial separation, exhibit a shared fate; measuring the state of one instantaneously determines the state of the other, irrespective of distance.  EPR argued this "spooky action at a distance" violated locality, implying faster-than-light communication.

However, subsequent experimental verification, notably the work of Alain Aspect in the 1980s, confirmed the reality of entanglement, supporting the predictions of quantum mechanics and refuting the EPR paradox.  Entanglement arises from the superposition principle, where a quantum system exists in multiple states simultaneously until measured, collapsing the wave function and instantaneously influencing its entangled counterparts. This peculiar behaviour forms the bedrock of emerging quantum technologies, with implications for quantum computing and cryptography.  Further research continues to illuminate the profound implications of this counterintuitive quantum phenomenon.
