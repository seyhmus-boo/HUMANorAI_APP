Catalysts are indispensable tools in organic chemistry, significantly accelerating reaction rates and enhancing selectivity, thereby enabling synthetic routes otherwise inaccessible.  Traditionally, homogeneous catalysts, often transition metal complexes, dominated the field, but inherent limitations, such as catalyst separation and potential for metal contamination, spurred advancements in heterogeneous catalysis.

Recent developments highlight the increasing prominence of heterogeneous catalysts supported on porous materials like metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and zeolites. These offer high surface area and tunable pore sizes, allowing for precise control over reactant access and product selectivity.  Furthermore, the rise of photocatalysis, employing semiconductor nanoparticles like TiO2 or graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), is revolutionising organic synthesis by leveraging light energy to drive challenging transformations, including C-H functionalization.  Significant progress has also been made in the design of biocatalysts, utilizing enzymes for enantioselective synthesis, tackling the challenge of stereochemical control with impressive efficiency.  These evolving methodologies are crucial for the development of sustainable and environmentally benign synthetic strategies.
