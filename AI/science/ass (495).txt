The remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their unique quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp² hybridized carbon atoms form a seamless cylindrical lattice, resulting in a delocalized π-electron system extending along the tube axis. This delocalized system leads to exceptionally high electrical conductivity, with conductivity varying significantly depending on chirality – the arrangement of the hexagonal carbon lattice.  Armchair nanotubes exhibit metallic behaviour due to their specific band structure, possessing a zero band gap, while zigzag and chiral nanotubes can be either metallic or semiconducting, depending on their diameter and chiral angle.  These electronic properties are governed by the quantum confinement effect, where the nanotube's diameter restricts the electron wavefunctions, leading to quantized energy levels.  Furthermore, the strong covalent bonds within the hexagonal lattice contribute to exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, making CNTs significantly stronger than steel at a fraction of the weight.  Their unique quantum mechanical characteristics thus underly their potential applications in diverse fields, from electronics to materials science.
