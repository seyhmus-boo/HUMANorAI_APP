Black hole formation represents a pivotal endpoint in stellar evolution, dictated primarily by the initial mass of the progenitor star.  Stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses exhaust their nuclear fuel, culminating in core collapse.  The ensuing gravitational collapse overcomes electron degeneracy pressure, leading to the formation of a neutron star. However, for progenitors significantly exceeding this critical mass (typically exceeding 25-40 solar masses, a range sensitive to metallicity and rotation), even neutron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to resist further gravitational implosion.  This unrestrained collapse results in the formation of a singularity, shrouded by an event horizon defining the black hole's boundary.  Alternative formation mechanisms, notably through the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe, are also posited, bypassing the stellar evolution pathway altogether.  These primordial black holes, while theoretically predicted, remain observationally challenging to confirm.  Ongoing research focuses on refining theoretical models of stellar collapse, including the effects of magnetic fields and rotation, to improve predictions of black hole mass and spin distributions, crucial for comparing theoretical models with observations from gravitational wave astronomy and X-ray observations of active galactic nuclei.
