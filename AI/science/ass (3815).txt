Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, have emerged as a material of exceptional scientific and technological interest since their discovery by Iijima in 1991.  Initially observed as byproducts of arc-discharge synthesis of fullerenes, these unique one-dimensional nanostructures quickly captivated researchers due to their remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.  Their exceptional tensile strength, exceeding that of steel at a significantly lower density, coupled with high elasticity, positions them as prime candidates for advanced composite materials.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit remarkable electrical conductivity, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality and diameter, offering potential for applications in nanoelectronics and sensors.  Their exceptional thermal conductivity, far surpassing that of copper, makes them attractive for thermal management applications.  However, despite significant advancements in synthesis and characterization techniques, challenges remain in controlling the precise growth and arrangement of CNTs, as well as addressing issues related to their dispersion and functionalization for optimal integration into practical devices.  This paper will delve into a comprehensive review of the key properties of CNTs, exploring their structure-property relationships and highlighting current research directions aimed at overcoming existing limitations and unlocking their full potential across diverse technological domains.
