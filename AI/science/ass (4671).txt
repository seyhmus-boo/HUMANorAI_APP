Photosynthesis, the process underpinning most life on Earth, remains a subject of intense scientific inquiry. This presentation will provide an overview of the key mechanisms involved in light harvesting, charge separation, and carbon fixation, focusing on the interplay between the two photosystems (PSI and PSII) within the thylakoid membrane.  We will explore the critical roles of chlorophyll and accessory pigments in light absorption and energy transfer, detailing the Z-scheme of electron transport and the generation of ATP and NADPH.  Further, the intricacies of Rubisco's function in the Calvin cycle, alongside its limitations and regulatory mechanisms, will be discussed.  The presentation will also briefly address the diverse photosynthetic pathways employed by various organisms, including C4 and CAM photosynthesis, highlighting their adaptations to different environmental conditions.  Finally, we will touch upon the potential of enhancing photosynthetic efficiency through genetic engineering and its implications for global food security and climate change mitigation.  This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive yet concise overview of this vital biological process and its ongoing significance for scientific research.
