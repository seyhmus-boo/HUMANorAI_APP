Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials exhibiting exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.  Their unique structure, consisting of seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets forming cylindrical tubules, dictates their diverse functionalities.  Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) possess exceptionally high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, alongside remarkable Young's modulus.  Their electrical properties are highly dependent on chirality, with some exhibiting metallic conductivity while others behave as semiconductors.  This tunable conductivity, coupled with high electron mobility, makes them promising candidates for advanced electronics.  Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), composed of concentric SWCNT layers, offer similar mechanical strength but generally demonstrate lower electrical conductivity.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, making them suitable for thermal management applications.  However, challenges remain, including controlled synthesis to achieve desired chirality distributions and the effective dispersion of CNTs in composite materials to fully leverage their exceptional properties. Ongoing research focuses on addressing these limitations to realize the full potential of CNTs in diverse technological fields.
