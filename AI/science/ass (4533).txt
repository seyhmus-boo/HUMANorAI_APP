Black hole formation represents a critical juncture in stellar and galactic evolution, driven by the interplay of gravity and extreme physical conditions. This presentation reviews the primary mechanisms underpinning black hole genesis, focusing on the collapse of massive stars and the potential for intermediate-mass black hole formation through alternative pathways.  We explore the crucial role of stellar metallicity, rotation, and magnetic fields in determining the final fate of a star, highlighting recent advancements in numerical simulations that illuminate the complex dynamics of core collapse and the ensuing gravitational collapse.  Particular emphasis will be given to the challenges in observing the immediate aftermath of a stellar-mass black hole's formation, including the detection of gravitational waves and the associated electromagnetic counterparts.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the ongoing debate surrounding the formation of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, considering both seed black hole growth and direct collapse scenarios.  Finally, we will briefly discuss open questions and future research directions in the field, focusing on the need for improved theoretical models and multi-messenger observations to advance our understanding of black hole formation across the cosmic mass spectrum.
