Catalysts revolutionized organic chemistry, enabling reactions previously unattainable under practical conditions.  Early examples, like the use of sulfuric acid in esterification dating back to the 18th century, were largely empirical. The development of transition metal catalysis, particularly from the mid-20th century onwards, marked a paradigm shift.  Nobel laureates like Wilkinson and Knowles demonstrated the power of homogeneous catalysis, utilizing organometallic complexes to achieve highly selective transformations, including asymmetric hydrogenation and olefin metathesis.  This ushered in an era of controlled reactivity, offering unprecedented access to complex molecules.

Heterogeneous catalysis, employing solid-supported catalysts, remains crucial, particularly in industrial processes.  Zeolites, for instance, exhibit shape-selectivity, controlling product distribution.  Furthermore, the field has expanded beyond traditional metal-based systems, with biocatalysis leveraging enzymes for highly specific and environmentally benign reactions.  Current research focuses on developing more sustainable, efficient, and selective catalysts, employing techniques such as computational modelling to design catalysts with tailored properties and exploring novel catalytic materials. This ongoing evolution promises further advancements in organic synthesis.
