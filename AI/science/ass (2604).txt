This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, tracing their historical development and outlining their fundamental principles.  We begin by examining the pioneering work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, whose experimental observations of nuclear fission in uranium, confirmed theoretically by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in 1939, marked a pivotal moment in scientific history.  The presentation will then delve into the underlying physics, explaining the process of neutron-induced fission and the subsequent release of energy and further neutrons, leading to the possibility of chain reactions.  Key concepts such as critical mass, fission yield, and the various fissionable isotopes (e.g., U-235, Pu-239) will be discussed.  Furthermore, we will briefly explore the different types of nuclear reactors utilizing fission, contrasting their designs and applications, highlighting the role of moderators and control rods in regulating the chain reaction. Finally, the presentation will touch upon the significance of nuclear fission in energy production and its associated challenges, including nuclear waste management and the potential for proliferation.  The aim is to provide a foundational understanding of this transformative process and its ongoing impact on society.
