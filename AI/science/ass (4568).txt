Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a topic of significant theoretical and observational investigation.  While the theoretical framework surrounding stellar-mass and supermassive black hole formation, encompassing processes like gravitational collapse and galactic mergers, is relatively well-established, directly observing and experimentally verifying these processes presents formidable challenges. The sheer scale and inaccessibility of these phenomena necessitate indirect observation methods, primarily reliant on the detection of gravitational waves and electromagnetic radiation emitted from accretion disks surrounding black holes.  This paper focuses on the experimental limitations inherent in studying black hole formation.  We will explore the difficulties associated with detecting the faint gravitational wave signals produced during the crucial moments of collapse, particularly for stellar-mass black holes formed in binary systems. Furthermore, we will address the challenges in disentangling the electromagnetic signatures of black hole formation from other astrophysical processes, highlighting the complexities of distinguishing between different formation pathways and identifying progenitor stars.  Finally, we will discuss the potential of future advancements in gravitational wave detectors and multi-messenger astronomy to overcome these limitations and advance our understanding of this fundamental astrophysical process.
