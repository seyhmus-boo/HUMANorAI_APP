Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the mechanisms of photosynthesis, a process fundamental to life on Earth.  Early understanding, dating back to the 17th century with van Helmont's willow tree experiment, incorrectly attributed plant growth solely to water intake.  Later,  Priestley and Ingenhousz clarified the roles of light and air, respectively, though the precise chemical reactions remained elusive.

The 20th century witnessed the elucidation of the light-dependent and light-independent reactions.  The former, occurring in the thylakoid membranes, involves photosystems I and II, utilizing light energy to split water (photolysis), generating ATP and NADPH.  These energy-rich molecules then fuel the Calvin cycle, the light-independent reaction.  This cyclical process, occurring in the stroma, fixes atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic molecules like glucose, utilizing the ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions.  This intricate interplay of light capture, electron transport, and carbon fixation forms the basis of photosynthetic energy conversion, sustaining virtually all terrestrial ecosystems.
