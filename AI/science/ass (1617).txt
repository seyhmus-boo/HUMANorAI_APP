Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms, were first observed in 1991 by Iijima, sparking intense research interest due to their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.  Their unique structure, characterized by single-walled (SWCNTs) or multi-walled (MWCNTs) configurations, dictates their diverse functionalities.  Mechanically, CNTs exhibit extraordinary tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel.  Electrically, SWCNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality, while MWCNTs generally exhibit metallic behavior.  This electronic diversity underpins their potential in nanoelectronics.  Thermally, CNTs possess exceptionally high thermal conductivity, making them attractive for thermal management applications.  However, challenges remain in controlling the chirality distribution during synthesis and achieving scalable, cost-effective production of high-quality CNTs.  Furthermore, the potential toxicity of CNTs necessitates further investigation for safe and responsible applications.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these limitations and exploring their diverse applications in fields ranging from composites and energy storage to biomedical devices and sensors.
