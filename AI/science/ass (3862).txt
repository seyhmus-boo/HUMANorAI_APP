Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the experimental challenges inherent in studying DNA replication.  While conceptually elegant – a semi-conservative process generating two identical DNA molecules from a single parent –  its in vivo investigation presents significant hurdles.  Precisely controlling the replication machinery within a living cell is inherently difficult, leading to difficulties in isolating specific intermediate steps.  Furthermore, the sheer speed and complexity of replication, involving numerous enzymes and proteins acting in a highly coordinated manner, makes real-time observation challenging.  Early experiments relied on isotopic labelling techniques, like Meselson-Stahl's work with heavy nitrogen, which provided crucial insights but lacked the resolution for finer details.  Modern techniques, such as single-molecule imaging and advanced sequencing, offer improvements but still grapple with artefacts from sample preparation and the inherent stochastic nature of the process.  Therefore, despite significant advancements, accurately quantifying replication dynamics and resolving the intricacies of error correction remain significant experimental challenges.
