Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, driving extensive interdisciplinary research.  Their unparalleled strength and high Young's modulus make them attractive for advanced composites in aerospace and civil engineering, demanding collaborations between materials science and engineering disciplines.  The exceptional electrical conductivity of metallic CNTs, coupled with the semiconducting nature of others, enables applications in electronics and sensing, necessitating collaborations with physicists and electrical engineers for device fabrication and integration.  Furthermore, CNTs' high surface area and unique chemical reactivity are leveraged in energy storage (e.g., supercapacitors and batteries) and catalysis, requiring chemical and electrochemical engineering expertise for optimizing performance and scalability.  However, challenges remain in achieving large-scale, cost-effective synthesis and controlling CNT chirality and uniformity, requiring synergistic approaches spanning chemistry, physics, and materials science.  Interdisciplinary research addressing these limitations is crucial for realizing the full potential of CNTs across diverse technological sectors.
