This presentation explores nuclear fission processes, highlighting their multifaceted nature and crucial interdisciplinary connections.  While fundamentally a physics phenomenon, the implications of fission extend deeply into chemistry, engineering, materials science, and the social sciences. We will examine the core physics of nuclear fission, including chain reactions, criticality, and the role of neutron moderation and reflectors.  The chemical consequences, such as the production and handling of radioactive isotopes and the challenges of spent fuel reprocessing, will then be addressed.  Further, we will discuss the critical engineering considerations involved in reactor design, including materials selection for radiation resistance and the development of efficient and safe energy conversion systems.  The interdisciplinary nature is further emphasized through a consideration of the socio-economic impacts of nuclear power, encompassing energy security, environmental concerns (nuclear waste management and proliferation), and the ethical dimensions of nuclear technology deployment.  The presentation will conclude by briefly discussing future directions in fission research, such as advanced reactor designs and the potential for sustainable nuclear energy.
