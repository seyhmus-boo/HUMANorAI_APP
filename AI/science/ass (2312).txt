Nuclear fission is the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and free neutrons. This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the daughter nuclei is less than the parent nucleus, the difference being converted to energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.  The released neutrons can then induce further fission events, leading to a chain reaction, the basis of nuclear reactors and weapons.

Recent developments focus on improving the efficiency and safety of fission processes.  Research into advanced reactor designs, such as Generation IV reactors, aims to enhance fuel utilization, improve safety features, and minimize waste production.  These designs explore concepts like molten salt reactors and fast neutron reactors, offering potential improvements over current light water reactors.  Furthermore, ongoing efforts concentrate on developing advanced nuclear fuel cycles, involving reprocessing spent nuclear fuel to recover uranium and plutonium for reuse, thus reducing long-term waste management challenges.  These advancements are crucial for sustainable nuclear energy production and mitigating the environmental impact of fission technology.
