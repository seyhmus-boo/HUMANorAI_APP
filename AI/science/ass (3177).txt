Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, is a fundamental process underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry.  This process, typically induced by neutron bombardment, results in the release of a significant quantity of energy, stemming primarily from the mass defect according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.  The fission of uranium-235 and plutonium-239 are particularly significant due to their high fission cross-sections and sustained chain reactions.  These reactions are characterized by the emission of multiple neutrons per fission event, facilitating a self-sustaining chain reaction crucial for reactor operation.  The specific fission products exhibit a wide range of isotopic compositions, many possessing substantial radioactive decay chains, contributing significantly to the long-term radioactive waste management challenges.  Reactor design incorporates control mechanisms to regulate the chain reaction rate, ensuring efficient energy production while mitigating the risks associated with criticality excursions.  Further research into advanced reactor designs focuses on improving safety, fuel efficiency, and waste minimization, utilizing techniques such as fast-neutron reactors and thorium-based fuel cycles.
