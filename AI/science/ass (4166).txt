DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring genetic inheritance, presents significant experimental challenges despite considerable advancements in understanding its mechanism.  Precisely recapitulating *in vitro* the fidelity and speed observed *in vivo* remains elusive.  The highly coordinated interplay of numerous proteins, including polymerases, helicases, and primases, necessitates sophisticated experimental designs to isolate and analyze individual componentsâ€™ contributions.  Furthermore, the inherent complexity of chromatin structure and its influence on replication fork progression presents a formidable obstacle.  Analyzing replication dynamics in real-time requires advanced imaging techniques, often hampered by the need for high spatiotemporal resolution at the single-molecule level. Studying replication in diverse organisms further complicates matters, due to variations in replication machinery and regulatory mechanisms.  Finally, accurately quantifying replication errors and their correction pathways remains a significant hurdle, particularly concerning the identification and characterization of rare mutagenic events.  Overcoming these challenges requires the development of novel experimental approaches combining advanced biophysical techniques with sophisticated computational modelling to fully unravel the intricacies of DNA replication.
