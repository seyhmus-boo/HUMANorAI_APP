Black hole formation represents a pivotal process in astrophysical evolution, driving the dynamics of galaxies and shaping the observable universe.  This presentation will review the primary mechanisms leading to black hole genesis, focusing on stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  We will examine the collapse of massive stars, detailing the interplay between stellar structure, nuclear reactions, and the critical Chandrasekhar mass limit.  The subsequent formation of a singularity and event horizon, along with the potential for associated phenomena like gamma-ray bursts, will be discussed.  Furthermore, the formation of supermassive black holes remains a subject of active research.  We will explore leading hypotheses, including direct collapse of primordial gas clouds and the hierarchical merging of stellar-mass black holes in dense galactic environments.  This presentation will synthesize recent theoretical advancements and observational constraints, highlighting the ongoing challenges and future directions in understanding this fundamental aspect of astrophysics, including the role of simulations in probing the highly dynamic processes involved in black hole formation across cosmic time.  Finally, open questions and avenues for future research will be briefly addressed.
