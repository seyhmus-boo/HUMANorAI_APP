Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This interconnectedness transcends classical physics, as the particles exhibit correlated properties even when causally disconnected.  Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the other, regardless of distance, defying local realism.

The implications of entanglement span multiple disciplines. In quantum computing, entangled qubits enable powerful algorithms surpassing classical computation.  Quantum cryptography leverages the non-local correlations for secure communication, as any eavesdropping attempt inevitably disturbs the entangled state.  Furthermore, entanglement plays a crucial role in fundamental physics, potentially bridging the gap between quantum mechanics and general relativity through its implications for spacetime.  In biology, tentative explorations are investigating the possibility of entanglement's role in biological processes, although this remains a highly speculative area.  The interdisciplinary nature of entanglement highlights its profound implications across physics, computer science, and even nascent areas like quantum biology.
