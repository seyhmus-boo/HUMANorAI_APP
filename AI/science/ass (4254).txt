Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical macromolecules composed entirely of carbon atoms, have captivated the scientific community since their discovery by Sumio Iijima in 1991.  This groundbreaking observation, initially made using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy within arc-discharge produced soot, revealed a novel allotrope of carbon exhibiting exceptional structural and electronic properties.  Iijima’s work sparked intense research efforts focused on understanding and harnessing the unique characteristics of these nanomaterials.  The subsequent decades have seen significant advancements in synthesis techniques, resulting in the production of both single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) with varying chiralities and diameters. This paper explores the fundamental properties underpinning the exceptional potential of CNTs across diverse technological applications.  We will examine their remarkable mechanical strength and stiffness, stemming from the strong sp² hybridized carbon bonds forming their hexagonal lattice structure.  Further, the electronic properties, ranging from semiconducting to metallic depending on the nanotube's chirality, will be discussed, alongside their unique thermal conductivity and surface area.  This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these properties and their implications for future advancements in materials science and engineering.
