Good morning. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a process intricately woven into the fabric of astrophysics, demanding a multidisciplinary approach for complete understanding.  Primarily, stellar-mass black holes emerge from the catastrophic gravitational collapse of massive stars (≥20 solar masses).  Nuclear fusion, the domain of nuclear physics, powers these stars, but when fuel is exhausted, the core implodes, exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. This implosion is governed by general relativity, a cornerstone of gravitational physics, leading to a singularity – a region of infinite density.

However, supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, present a more complex puzzle.  While stellar-mass black hole mergers, studied via gravitational wave astronomy (a triumph of physics and engineering), contribute, their mass acquisition cannot fully explain the sheer scale of these behemoths.  Here, we encounter interdisciplinary links with computational astrophysics – simulating galaxy mergers and accretion processes –  and even potentially with particle physics, investigating exotic scenarios like primordial black hole formation in the early universe.  Ultimately, understanding black hole formation requires a synthesis of insights from across these fields.
