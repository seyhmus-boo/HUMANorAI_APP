Good morning. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a fascinating area of ongoing research in astrophysics.  Primarily, stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses at the end of their lifecycle.  This collapse, initiated after nuclear fusion ceases, results in a singularity surrounded by an event horizon â€“ the point of no return.

Recent developments have refined our understanding of this process.  High-resolution simulations are increasingly sophisticated, offering insights into the dynamics of collapsing stellar cores, particularly concerning the role of magnetic fields and rotation in shaping the final black hole properties. Furthermore, the detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes by LIGO and Virgo has provided observational confirmation of binary black hole systems and valuable data on their masses and spins, corroborating theoretical models of stellar evolution and black hole formation.  Ongoing research focuses on the detailed astrophysical mechanisms leading to binary black hole mergers and exploring the potential for intermediate-mass black hole formation, a less understood pathway.
