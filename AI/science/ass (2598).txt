CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and versatile platform for genome editing.  Recent developments significantly expand the technique's capabilities beyond simple gene knockouts and insertions.  Base editing, employing deactivated Cas nucleases fused to deaminases, allows for targeted single-base modifications without creating double-stranded breaks, thus minimizing off-target effects and increasing precision.  Prime editing, a more sophisticated approach, utilizes a reverse transcriptase fused to Cas nickase, enabling all 12 possible base-to-base conversions and small insertions or deletions with a single guide RNA.  Furthermore, advancements in delivery systems, including the development of improved viral vectors and non-viral methods like lipid nanoparticles, enhance the efficiency and accessibility of CRISPR technology in diverse organisms and cell types.  Beyond gene correction, CRISPR is increasingly utilized for gene regulation, employing catalytically inactive Cas proteins (dCas) fused to transcriptional activators or repressors to modulate gene expression.  This ongoing refinement of CRISPR technology broadens its potential applications in various fields, from treating genetic diseases to developing novel agricultural products and biomanufacturing processes.
