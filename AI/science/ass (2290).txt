Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of sp²-bonded carbon atoms.  Their discovery spurred intense research due to their potential applications across diverse fields.  CNTs exhibit extraordinary mechanical strength, exceeding that of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility and high tensile strength.  Their electrical properties are equally compelling, demonstrating behaviours ranging from metallic conductivity to semiconducting behaviour depending on chirality – the arrangement of the hexagonal carbon lattice. This tunability is crucial for their potential in nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptionally high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  However, challenges remain, particularly concerning the precise control of CNT synthesis and their tendency to agglomerate, hindering their widespread implementation.  Despite these limitations, the exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of CNTs continue to drive advancements in materials science and nano-engineering, promising transformative applications in diverse areas from composites to energy storage and biomedical devices.
