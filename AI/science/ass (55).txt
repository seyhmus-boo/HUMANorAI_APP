Good morning. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission, the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a substantial amount of energy.  This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the daughter nuclei is less than the parent nucleus; the difference is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  The process is initiated by bombarding a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with a neutron.  This neutron absorption leads to an unstable nucleus that subsequently fissions, releasing further neutrons which can then trigger a chain reaction.  Control over this chain reaction is crucial.

The practical applications of nuclear fission are predominantly in energy generation.  Nuclear power plants utilize controlled fission reactions to produce heat, which is then used to generate steam and drive turbines for electricity production.  While concerns regarding nuclear waste disposal and potential accidents exist, nuclear power offers a high-energy density alternative to fossil fuels, significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  Furthermore, fission has also found application in medical isotopes production for diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy, showcasing its dual nature as both a powerful energy source and a valuable tool in medicine.
