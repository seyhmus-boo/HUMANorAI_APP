Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient method for genome editing.  Despite its transformative potential, the application of CRISPR technology remains fraught with experimental challenges that limit its widespread and reliable use. This paper will explore key hurdles currently hindering the full realization of CRISPR's therapeutic and research capabilities.  Specifically, we will examine the challenges associated with off-target effects, which result in unintended genomic modifications, and the difficulties in achieving consistent and high efficiency gene editing across diverse cell types and organisms.  Furthermore, the complexities surrounding delivery systems, particularly for *in vivo* applications, will be analyzed, considering both viral and non-viral methods and their associated limitations.  Finally, we will discuss the ethical considerations surrounding CRISPR technology and its potential impact on future research directions.  Addressing these experimental challenges is critical for advancing CRISPR's therapeutic potential and ensuring its responsible and effective implementation.
