Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on black hole formation.  Imagine a massive star, perhaps tens of times the mass of our Sun, as a colossal bonfire.  This bonfire burns fiercely, fuelled by nuclear fusion in its core.  However, this fuel is finite.  When the fuel is exhausted, the bonfire's immense gravitational pull, previously counteracted by outward pressure from fusion, becomes dominant.

This gravitational collapse is akin to the bonfire imploding upon itself, crushing its own ashes.  The core compresses dramatically, exceeding a critical density – the Schwarzschild radius – at which point even light cannot escape its intense gravitational field. This implosion, for stars exceeding a certain mass threshold (around three times the Sun’s mass), results in the formation of a singularity: a point of infinite density at the heart of a black hole.  The surrounding spacetime is warped and distorted, forming the event horizon, a point of no return.  The process, therefore, is a dramatic transformation from a luminous giant to an inescapable gravitational sinkhole within spacetime.  The remnants of the star may form an accretion disk, further intensifying the black hole's gravitational influence.
