Black hole formation is a cornerstone of astrophysical understanding, stemming primarily from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, the inward gravitational pull overcomes outward radiation pressure. This leads to a catastrophic implosion, compressing the stellar core to a point of infinite density, a singularity, shrouded by an event horizon.  The mass of the progenitor star dictates the black hole's eventual size, with stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses typically producing stellar-mass black holes.

Recent developments have significantly refined our understanding of this process.  Gravitational wave astronomy, through the detection of mergers by LIGO and Virgo, offers direct evidence of black hole formation and evolution, revealing details about their masses and spins, challenging some earlier theoretical models.  Furthermore, advancements in numerical relativity simulations allow for more accurate modeling of the collapse process, providing insights into the dynamics of jet formation and gravitational wave emission.  Studies of supermassive black holes at galactic centers continue to pose intriguing questions regarding their formation mechanisms, with proposed explanations encompassing direct collapse scenarios and the mergers of smaller black holes. These advancements are continually reshaping our comprehension of black hole demographics and their influence on galactic evolution.
