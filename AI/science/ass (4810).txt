Quantum entanglement describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  Unlike classical correlations, which can be explained by shared properties, entangled systems exhibit correlations that violate Bell's inequalities, demonstrating their inherently non-local nature. This arises from the superposition principle; a composite system can exist in a superposition of entangled states, which are not simply tensor products of individual system states.  

Mathematically, an entangled state is represented by a wavefunction that cannot be factorized into individual wavefunctions for each subsystem. For instance, the singlet state of two spin-1/2 particles,  |Ψ⟩ = (|↑↓⟩ - |↓↑⟩)/√2, exemplifies entanglement. Measurement of the spin of one particle instantaneously determines the spin of the other, regardless of spatial separation.  This instantaneous correlation, however, does not allow for faster-than-light communication as the outcome of individual measurements remains probabilistic until measured.  The resolution of this apparent paradox lies in the non-local nature of the quantum wavefunction,  emphasizing the fundamental departure from classical intuitions.
