DNA replication, the semiconservative process by which a double-stranded DNA molecule produces two identical copies, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding of replication emerged from the Meselson-Stahl experiment (1958), which definitively demonstrated the semiconservative nature of the process, rejecting the conservative and dispersive models then under consideration.  This experiment, utilizing density gradient centrifugation of differentially labeled DNA, provided crucial evidence that each daughter molecule retains one parental strand, forming a new complementary strand.  The molecular mechanism involves a complex interplay of enzymes and proteins.  DNA helicase unwinds the double helix, creating a replication fork.  Single-stranded binding proteins (SSBs) stabilize the separated strands, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a starting point for DNA polymerase III, the main enzyme responsible for adding nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes the RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the gaps between Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand, completing the replication process. The remarkable fidelity of DNA replication, crucial for maintaining genetic integrity, is ensured by the proofreading activity inherent to many DNA polymerases.
