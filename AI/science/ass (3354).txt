DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring genetic continuity, proceeds via a semi-conservative mechanism, where each newly synthesized double helix incorporates one parental strand.  This process is initiated at specific origins of replication, unwound by helicases and stabilized by single-strand binding proteins.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing 3'-OH termini for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for leading and lagging strand synthesis.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I excises RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase then seals the phosphodiester backbone between Okazaki fragments, ensuring genomic integrity.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and sophisticated mismatch repair systems.  Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, present a unique replication challenge, addressed by telomerase in germline cells.  Dysregulation of these processes can lead to genomic instability, driving mutagenesis and contributing to diseases such as cancer.  Ongoing research continues to unravel the intricate mechanisms and regulatory networks governing DNA replication, revealing its critical role in maintaining genome stability and cellular function.
