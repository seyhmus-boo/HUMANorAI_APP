Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them attractive for diverse technological applications.  This review summarizes the key characteristics of CNTs, focusing on their structure-property relationships.  Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) possess remarkable tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, coupled with high flexibility. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) exhibit similarly impressive mechanical properties, though slightly reduced compared to SWCNTs.  Electrical conductivity in CNTs is highly dependent on chirality, with metallic and semiconducting behaviours observed.  This tunability offers potential for advanced electronic devices.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit exceptionally high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of many metals, making them promising for thermal management applications.  However, challenges remain, including the efficient separation of metallic and semiconducting SWCNTs, controlling CNT diameter and length distributions during synthesis, and addressing potential toxicity concerns.  Ongoing research continues to address these challenges, paving the way for the widespread integration of CNTs into next-generation technologies.
