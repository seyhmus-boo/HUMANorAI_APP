DNA replication, the fundamental process of duplicating the genome, is a remarkably accurate and highly regulated cellular mechanism.  This review summarizes the key features of this process, focusing on the intricate interplay of enzymes and proteins involved.  Initiation, involving origin recognition complex (ORC) binding and helicase loading, is crucial for establishing replication forks.  The unwinding of the double helix, facilitated by helicases and single-stranded binding proteins (SSBPs), exposes the template strands for DNA polymerase action.  Leading and lagging strand synthesis, employing the distinct mechanisms of continuous and discontinuous replication, respectively, are discussed.  The essential roles of primase, DNA ligase, and topoisomerases in maintaining genomic integrity are highlighted.  Furthermore, the review touches upon the fidelity mechanisms ensuring accurate replication, including proofreading activity of polymerases and mismatch repair pathways.  While considerable progress has been made, several aspects, including the regulation of replication timing and the resolution of replication stress, remain active areas of research.  Understanding DNA replication is paramount for comprehending cellular proliferation, genome stability, and disease pathogenesis.
