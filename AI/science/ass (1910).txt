Stellar-mass black hole formation is a consequence of the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.  Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel in their cores, these stars undergo a series of increasingly unstable burning phases, ultimately leading to core collapse.  The precise mechanism driving the collapse and subsequent black hole formation remains an area of active research, with competing models focusing on the role of neutrino emission, magnetic fields, and the equation of state of dense nuclear matter.  Successful formation requires sufficient mass to overcome neutron degeneracy pressure, resulting in a singularity at the core.  The subsequent accretion of surrounding stellar material further contributes to the black hole's mass and growth, often accompanied by powerful outflows and relativistic jets observed as supernovae or hypernovae. Supermassive black holes, significantly more massive than their stellar counterparts, likely originate through a combination of processes, including the merging of smaller black holes and direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe.  Understanding these disparate formation pathways requires integrating observations across the electromagnetic spectrum and gravitational wave detections, coupled with sophisticated numerical simulations of hydrodynamics, general relativity, and stellar evolution.
