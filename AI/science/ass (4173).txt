Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, has underpinned life on Earth for billions of years.  Early understanding, stemming from Jan Ingenhousz's 18th-century experiments, revealed the oxygen-releasing nature of the process in illuminated plants.  However, the intricate mechanisms remained elusive until the 20th century.

Photosynthesis is broadly divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The light-dependent reactions, occurring in thylakoid membranes, involve photosystems II and I.  Light absorption by chlorophyll excites electrons, initiating an electron transport chain that generates ATP and NADPH.  Water is split (photolysis), releasing oxygen as a byproduct.  The Calvin cycle, situated in the stroma, utilizes the ATP and NADPH generated to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic molecules, primarily glucose, via a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

Different photosynthetic pathways, such as C4 and CAM, have evolved in response to environmental constraints, demonstrating the remarkable adaptability of this fundamental biological process.  Continued research explores the optimization of photosynthesis for enhanced crop yields and biofuel production.
