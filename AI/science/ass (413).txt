Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, bridging diverse fields from stellar evolution to cosmology.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of the established mechanisms of black hole formation, focusing on both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  We will examine the currently favored paradigm of stellar-mass black hole formation via the core-collapse of massive stars, highlighting recent advancements in numerical simulations that are improving our understanding of the progenitor properties and the impact of rotation and magnetic fields.  

Furthermore, the formation of supermassive black holes, whose origins are still debated, will be discussed.  Recent observations from gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo, coupled with improved electromagnetic observations, are providing unprecedented insights into binary black hole mergers, potentially shedding light on their assembly history and contributing to models of hierarchical growth.  We will also briefly address alternative formation scenarios, such as direct collapse and the role of seed black holes.  Finally, we will touch upon the ongoing challenges and future directions in this active research area, emphasizing the need for multi-messenger astronomy and advanced numerical modelling techniques to unravel the mysteries surrounding black hole formation across cosmic time.
