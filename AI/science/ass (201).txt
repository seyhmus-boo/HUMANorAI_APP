Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes.  The discovery of nuclear fission, a pivotal moment in scientific history, occurred in 1938 when Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, building upon the work of Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, observed the splitting of uranium nuclei.  This process, initiated by neutron bombardment, results in the formation of lighter nuclei and the release of a significant amount of energy, explained by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.

Fission is fundamentally a process of nuclear rearrangement.  A heavy nucleus, such as uranium-235, absorbs a neutron, becoming unstable. This instability leads to the nucleus splitting into two smaller fragments, termed fission fragments, typically isotopes of elements near the middle of the periodic table.  Crucially, this reaction also releases further neutrons, leading to the potential for a chain reaction, provided a sufficient mass of fissile material – the critical mass – is present.  This chain reaction underlies the operation of nuclear reactors and weapons.  The precise fission fragments produced vary, contributing to the complexity of managing nuclear waste.  Further exploration of this intricate process will form the basis of our subsequent lectures.
