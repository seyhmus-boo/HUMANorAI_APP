DNA replication, the process by which a cell creates an identical copy of its genome, is crucial for cellular proliferation and genetic inheritance.  This semiconservative process relies on the unwinding of the parental double helix by helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the separated strands, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for leading and lagging strand synthesis.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously in the 5' to 3' direction, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase then joins the Okazaki fragments, resulting in two identical double helixes.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and sophisticated DNA repair mechanisms that correct errors introduced during replication.  Dysregulation of this intricate process can lead to mutations and genomic instability, contributing to various diseases, including cancer.
