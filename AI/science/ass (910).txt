Good morning. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a process deeply intertwined with multiple branches of physics and astronomy.  Primarily, the gravitational collapse of a sufficiently massive star is the dominant pathway.  When a star's nuclear fuel is exhausted, its core can no longer withstand the inward pull of gravity. This leads to a catastrophic implosion, generating immense pressures and temperatures.  General relativity, a cornerstone of our understanding, dictates the spacetime curvature near these collapsing objects.  The resulting singularity, a point of infinite density, marks the formation of a black hole, its event horizon delineating the point of no return.

However, the interdisciplinary nature extends beyond relativity.  Nuclear physics underpins our comprehension of stellar evolution and the precise energy generation processes within stars, determining their ultimate fate and mass, which dictates if collapse results in a neutron star or a black hole.  Furthermore, computational astrophysics employs sophisticated numerical simulations to model the complexities of these collapses, incorporating elements of fluid dynamics and magnetohydrodynamics to account for the behaviour of the stellar material during the implosion. This ultimately informs our observations and interpretations of astronomical data from multi-wavelength telescopes.
