Black hole formation represents a culmination of stellar evolution under extreme gravitational conditions.  This lecture will outline the primary mechanisms leading to their genesis.  Primarily, the process begins with the life cycle of massive stars (≥20 solar masses).  Nuclear fusion within these stars gradually exhausts their fuel, culminating in the formation of an iron core.  The inability of iron to undergo further fusion renders the core gravitationally unstable.  Subsequently, core collapse ensues, resulting in a catastrophic implosion.  This implosion triggers a supernova explosion, ejecting the outer layers of the star while the core continues to collapse under its own gravity.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), the collapse is irreversible, leading to the formation of a singularity and the emergence of a black hole, characterized by an event horizon beyond which no information can escape.  Alternative formation mechanisms, including the direct collapse of gas clouds in the early universe, will also be briefly discussed.  The lecture will conclude by highlighting ongoing research into the detailed dynamics and observational signatures of black hole formation.
