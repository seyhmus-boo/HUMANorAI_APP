Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, has been a subject of scientific inquiry for centuries. Early understanding, stemming from Priestley's discovery of oxygen production by plants in 1772, was rudimentary.  Ingenhousz later elucidated the light dependency, while Sachs demonstrated starch formation in leaves.  The 20th century saw the elucidation of the underlying biochemical mechanisms, culminating in the understanding of the two main stages: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.

The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.  Here, photosystems II and I, containing chlorophyll and accessory pigments, absorb light energy, driving electron transport chains that generate ATP and NADPH.  Water photolysis provides electrons and releases oxygen as a byproduct.  The Calvin cycle, occurring in the stroma, utilizes ATP and NADPH to fix atmospheric CO2 into organic molecules, primarily glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), through a series of enzymatic reactions.  Variations exist, such as C4 and CAM pathways, adaptations to arid conditions optimizing carbon fixation efficiency.  Ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of regulatory mechanisms and the intricate interplay between environmental factors and photosynthetic efficiency.
