Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the fundamental principles of chemical bonding and molecular structure.  Early attempts to understand these concepts, notably Dalton's atomic theory in the early 19th century, provided a rudimentary framework, but lacked an explanation for the forces holding atoms together.  The development of quantum mechanics in the 20th century revolutionized our understanding.  We now comprehend bonding as a consequence of electrostatic interactions and the sharing or transfer of electrons between atoms to achieve stable electron configurations, primarily fulfilling the octet rule.

Ionic bonding, arising from the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions formed by electron transfer, contrasts with covalent bonding, where electrons are shared between atoms to form molecular orbitals.  The resulting molecular geometry, crucial to a molecule's properties, can be predicted using theories such as Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, which considers the repulsion between electron pairs around a central atom.  Understanding these bonding types and resulting molecular structures is paramount to predicting and explaining the diverse physical and chemical properties of matter.
