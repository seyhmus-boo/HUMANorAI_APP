DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is a fundamental biological process crucial for cell division and heredity.  This meticulously orchestrated event employs a semi-conservative mechanism, ensuring each daughter cell inherits an identical copy.  Initiation involves the unwinding of the double helix at origins of replication by helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the separated strands, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for adding nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is replicated discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I excises RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, resulting in two complete, identical DNA molecules.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases, minimizing errors and ensuring genomic stability.  Disruptions to this process can lead to mutations and genomic instability, contributing to various pathologies.
