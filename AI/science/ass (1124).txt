Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, driving extensive research into their applications.  Their remarkable tensile strength, exceeding that of steel at a fraction of the weight, coupled with high Young's modulus, makes them promising for advanced composites.  Recent advancements focus on controlled synthesis methods, enabling precise manipulation of CNT diameter, chirality, and length, thereby tailoring their properties for specific applications.  This includes the development of scalable techniques like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with improved purity and yield.  Electrical properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, are being harnessed in next-generation electronics, with progress in device fabrication via solution-based processing and direct growth on substrates.  Furthermore, research into functionalization strategies enhances CNT dispersion and biocompatibility, opening avenues for biomedical applications such as drug delivery and biosensors.  Despite challenges related to scalability and cost-effective production, ongoing research continues to unlock the immense potential of CNTs across diverse fields.
