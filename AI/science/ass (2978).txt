Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, with ongoing refinement of theoretical models and observational constraints.  The classical understanding posits two primary pathways: stellar-mass black holes, resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 solar masses) after exhausting their nuclear fuel; and supermassive black holes (SMBHs), inhabiting the centers of most galaxies, whose formation mechanisms remain less certain.  While direct collapse scenarios and the merger of stellar-mass black holes contribute, recent simulations highlight the importance of early galactic dynamics and the accretion of surrounding gas, potentially involving seed black holes formed from Population III stars.  Advances in gravitational wave astronomy, via detectors such as LIGO and Virgo, provide crucial data on the mergers of stellar-mass black holes, offering insights into their masses, spins, and formation environments.  Furthermore, observations of the Event Horizon Telescope, providing the first images of SMBH shadows, offer unparalleled constraints on the accretion physics surrounding these enigmatic objects, challenging and refining existing theoretical frameworks regarding their growth and evolution. This combined approach of theoretical modeling, gravitational wave detection, and high-resolution imaging is revolutionizing our understanding of black hole formation across the entire mass spectrum.
