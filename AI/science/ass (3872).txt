The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including their high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity, and unique thermal properties, have spurred intense research interest. However, realizing the full potential of CNTs in technological applications faces significant experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains elusive, often yielding a heterogeneous mixture of diameters, lengths, chiralities, and structural defects.  This heterogeneity complicates characterization and limits the reproducibility of experimental results, making it difficult to establish structure-property relationships with certainty.  Furthermore, the strong van der Waals forces between individual nanotubes lead to bundling, hindering their dispersion in solvents and matrices.  Effective dispersion strategies, employing techniques such as sonication or functionalization, often compromise the inherent properties of the nanotubes.  Accurate measurement of individual CNT properties is also problematic, as techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) are often limited by sample preparation and resolution constraints.  These experimental difficulties underscore the need for continued development of advanced synthesis, processing, and characterization methods to unlock the full potential of CNTs.
