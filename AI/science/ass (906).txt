Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential for diverse applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges related to their synthesis, characterization, and processing. This presentation will address key experimental limitations in harnessing CNT properties.  Specifically, we will discuss the difficulties in achieving controlled synthesis of CNTs with precise chirality and diameter distribution, crucial for predictable material behavior.  Further challenges arise in the accurate characterization of CNT properties, particularly the precise determination of structural defects and their influence on mechanical strength and electrical conductivity.  Advanced microscopy techniques, while offering high resolution, often struggle with the quantification of these defects in dense CNT networks.  Finally, the dispersion and integration of CNTs into functional devices presents a significant hurdle, with aggregation tendencies affecting both macroscopic properties and device performance.  This presentation will explore these experimental challenges, highlight recent advances in mitigation strategies, and suggest avenues for future research focusing on overcoming these obstacles to enable the widespread adoption of CNTs in advanced technologies.
