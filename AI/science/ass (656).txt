Nuclear fission processes constitute the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into two lighter nuclei, accompanied by the release of a significant quantity of energy and the emission of neutrons.  These processes are initiated by the absorption of a neutron, inducing an unstable state within the nucleus.  Subsequent fission events are characterized by a broad range of possible daughter nuclei, leading to a complex distribution of fission products with varying masses and radioactive properties.  The energy released during fission primarily manifests as kinetic energy of the fission fragments, subsequently converted into heat.  The emitted neutrons, crucial for sustaining a chain reaction, possess a range of energies, necessitating consideration of neutron moderation techniques in reactor designs to optimize fission efficiency.  The probability of fission occurring is governed by the incident neutron energy and the target nucleus, parameters central to reactor criticality calculations.  Variations in fission yield and neutron emission characteristics amongst different fissile isotopes necessitate tailored reactor designs and fuel management strategies to maximize energy production and minimize waste generation.  Understanding the intricacies of these processes is fundamental to both the application of nuclear fission in energy production and the mitigation of associated risks.
