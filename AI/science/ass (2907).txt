The formation of black holes, astrophysical objects of extreme density and gravitational pull, remains a captivating area of research. While classical general relativity provides a robust framework for describing their macroscopic properties and dynamics, a complete understanding necessitates the incorporation of quantum mechanical effects, particularly near the event horizon where spacetime curvature reaches its most extreme values.  This paper investigates black hole formation through a quantum mechanical lens, focusing on the inherent challenges and unanswered questions posed by the interplay between general relativity and quantum field theory.  We explore the limitations of classical models in accurately describing the final stages of stellar collapse and the singularity formation, highlighting the need for a quantum theory of gravity to provide a comprehensive description.  Specifically, we will examine the role of quantum fluctuations in the initial conditions leading to collapse, the potential impact of quantum effects on the event horizon structure, and the implications of Hawking radiation for information loss paradoxes. By addressing these crucial aspects, this research aims to advance our understanding of black hole formation beyond the classical paradigm and contribute to the development of a unified theory of gravity.
