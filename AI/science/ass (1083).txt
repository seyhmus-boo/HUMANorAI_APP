Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of the spatial separation.  This interconnectedness transcends classical intuition; measuring the property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the corresponding property of its partner, even across vast distances.  Imagine flipping two coins that are mysteriously linked: if one lands heads, the other *must* land tails, instantaneously, regardless of the distance between them. This defies locality, a principle fundamental to classical physics.

The entangled particles don't possess pre-defined properties until measured; their states exist in a superposition, a probabilistic blend of possibilities.  Analogously, consider a spinning coin in the air â€“ it's neither heads nor tails until it lands.  Entanglement extends this concept to multiple particles, inextricably linking their probabilistic states.  Einstein famously referred to this "spooky action at a distance," highlighting the counterintuitive nature of the phenomenon.  However, despite its paradoxical aspects, quantum entanglement is a well-established physical phenomenon with significant implications for quantum computing and cryptography, leveraging its inherent correlation for secure communication and powerful computation.
