Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, the fundamental process ensuring genetic continuity.  Imagine DNA as a twisted ladder, its sides representing the sugar-phosphate backbone, and the rungs, the base pairs.  Replication begins with the enzyme helicase "unzipping" this ladder, separating the strands.  Each strand now serves as a template.

Think of this unzipped DNA as a photographic negative.  Enzymes, specifically DNA polymerase, act as specialized printers, using free-floating nucleotides – the "ink" – to create complementary strands.  Following the base-pairing rules (A with T, G with C), a new "positive" is generated for each negative.  This results in two identical DNA molecules, each consisting of one original strand and one newly synthesized strand; a semi-conservative model.  The process, while seemingly simple, is remarkably precise, involving multiple enzymes working in a coordinated fashion to ensure accurate duplication of the genetic blueprint.  Any errors are swiftly corrected by proofreading mechanisms, minimizing mutations.
