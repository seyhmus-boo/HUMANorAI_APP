Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, represents a pivotal scientific discovery with profound implications. This presentation provides a concise overview of fission processes, tracing their historical trajectory from the theoretical predictions of nuclear physics in the early 20th century to their practical applications today.  We will explore the seminal work of scientists like Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, who elucidated the mechanism of nuclear fission following the experimental observations of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann.  The presentation will delve into the underlying physics governing fission, including the role of neutron bombardment, critical mass, and the release of immense energy.  Different types of fission, including spontaneous and induced fission, will be discussed alongside their associated energy yields and radioactive byproducts.  Furthermore, we will briefly examine the various applications of fission, focusing on its role in nuclear power generation and the historical context of its utilization in nuclear weaponry.  Finally, we will touch upon ongoing research aimed at improving the efficiency and safety of fission reactors and managing the challenges associated with nuclear waste.
