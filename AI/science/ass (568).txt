DNA replication, the fundamental process by which genetic information is duplicated, is a cornerstone of molecular biology and crucial for cell proliferation and inheritance.  Its intricate mechanisms have captivated researchers since the discovery of the double helix structure by Watson and Crick in 1953. This landmark achievement, building upon Chargaff's rules and Franklin's X-ray diffraction data, immediately posed the compelling question of how such a structure could accurately replicate itself.  Early models, including conservative and dispersive replication, were proposed but ultimately refuted by the Meselson-Stahl experiment in 1958, which definitively established the semi-conservative nature of DNA replication â€“ each new DNA molecule retaining one parental strand.  Subsequent decades have witnessed remarkable progress in elucidating the complex machinery involved, including the identification of key enzymes such as DNA polymerase, helicase, and primase, and a detailed understanding of the various stages, from initiation and unwinding to elongation and termination.  This paper will delve into the current understanding of DNA replication, exploring its intricate mechanisms, regulatory pathways, and the implications of errors and repair processes in maintaining genomic stability and preventing diseases.  Furthermore, we will examine recent advancements and ongoing research in this dynamic field.
