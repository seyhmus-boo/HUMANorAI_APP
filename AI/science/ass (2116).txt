Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This linkage manifests as a correlation in their quantum states: measuring the property of one particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the other, even across vast distances.  This correlation transcends classical physics, violating Bell's inequalities which demonstrate the limitations of local realism.  The entangled particles share a combined quantum state, not individual states, until measurement collapses the wavefunction into a definite state for both.

The seemingly instantaneous correlation, however, doesn't allow for faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of the measurement on one particle is inherently random.  Nonetheless, this peculiar characteristic has significant potential for practical applications. Quantum computing leverages entanglement to perform computations beyond the capabilities of classical computers. Quantum cryptography exploits it to create unconditionally secure communication channels. Moreover, advancements in quantum sensing and metrology utilize entanglement to enhance precision in measurement and imaging techniques, promising breakthroughs in areas such as medical diagnostics and materials science.
