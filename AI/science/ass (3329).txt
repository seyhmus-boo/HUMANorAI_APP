Black hole formation represents a critical juncture in stellar evolution and a significant area of astrophysical research.  The process fundamentally depends on the initial mass of a star.  Stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses collapse directly into black holes upon the exhaustion of their nuclear fuel, undergoing a core-collapse supernova. Lower mass stars, between approximately 8 and 20 solar masses, initially form neutron stars; however, accretion of matter from a binary companion or subsequent collapse can lead to the formation of black holes.  The dynamics of this collapse, including the role of neutrino emission and magnetic fields, remain active areas of investigation, often modeled using complex numerical simulations.  Understanding black hole formation informs our knowledge of gravitational wave emission, as detected by observatories such as LIGO and Virgo.  These observations provide invaluable constraints on stellar evolution models and the properties of black holes. Furthermore, the accretion disks surrounding black holes, powering active galactic nuclei (AGN) and quasars, are essential for understanding galaxy evolution and the distribution of matter in the universe.  Continued study of black hole formation is crucial for advancing our comprehension of extreme astrophysical phenomena and their impact on the cosmos.
