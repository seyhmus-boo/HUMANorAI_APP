Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure.  Imagine a single sheet of graphite, graphene, rolled into a seamless cylinder; this simple concept underpins their remarkable characteristics.  Their high aspect ratio, analogous to incredibly strong and lightweight fibres, leads to exceptional tensile strength, far exceeding that of steel.  Their electrical conductivity varies dramatically depending on their chirality â€“ the way the graphene sheet is rolled.  Consider this as a switch: some CNTs behave like metallic conductors, offering low resistance to electrical current, while others act as semiconductors, analogous to transistors, controlling current flow.  Their thermal conductivity rivals that of diamond, picturing them as microscopic heat pipes efficiently dissipating thermal energy.  Furthermore, their surface area, akin to a highly porous sponge, allows for significant adsorption and functionalization, opening avenues for diverse applications.  This unique combination of mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, coupled with their tunable chemical reactivity, makes CNTs promising materials for applications spanning electronics, composites, and energy storage.  This presentation will delve deeper into these fascinating properties and their potential implications.
