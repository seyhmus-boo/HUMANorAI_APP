Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, continues to be a subject of intense investigation.  While the theoretical framework, primarily relying on general relativity, is well-established for stellar-mass black holes forming from the gravitational collapse of massive stars,  recent advancements focus on refining our understanding of the specific processes involved.  Numerical simulations, employing increasingly sophisticated codes, are providing crucial insights into the role of stellar rotation, magnetic fields, and the complex interplay of hydrodynamics and gravity during core collapse.  These simulations are revealing a nuanced picture beyond simple spherical symmetry, highlighting the importance of asymmetries in generating gravitational waves detectable by instruments like LIGO and Virgo.

Regarding supermassive black holes, the mechanisms of their formation remain a significant area of debate. While direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a proposed pathway, recent research emphasizes the role of mergers and accretion of smaller black holes, potentially seeded by stellar-mass progenitors. Observational constraints from galaxy surveys and high-resolution imaging are continuously refining models, particularly concerning the relationship between black hole growth and galaxy evolution. The integration of multi-messenger astronomy, combining gravitational wave detections with electromagnetic observations, promises to further illuminate the complex dynamics of black hole formation across all mass scales.
