Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  It's not simply a classical electrostatic repulsion overcoming the strong nuclear force; rather, it's governed by the probabilistic nature of quantum tunneling.  The initial nucleus exists in a potential well, and fission occurs when the system tunnels through the potential barrier separating the initial state from the separated fission fragments.  This tunneling probability is highly sensitive to the shape of the potential energy surface, which is influenced by the collective nuclear coordinates and the underlying nucleon-nucleon interactions, described by effective quantum field theories.

The crucial role of shell effects, a manifestation of quantum confinement and Pauli exclusion principle, influences the stability and fissionability of nuclei.  Deformed nuclear shapes, explored using models like the liquid drop model augmented with shell corrections, are crucial intermediate states in the fission process, highlighting the importance of collective excitations.  Furthermore, the prompt emission of neutrons post-fission is a direct consequence of the excited states of the fragments, quickly decaying via gamma emission and neutron evaporation, further emphasizing the quantum nature of the emitted particles' energy and angular momentum distributions.  Ultimately, a complete description requires sophisticated theoretical frameworks encompassing both single-particle and collective degrees of freedom within a time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation framework.
