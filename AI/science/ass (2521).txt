CRISPR-Cas systems, revolutionizing genetic engineering, are derived from a prokaryotic adaptive immune system.  Initially observed in bacteria as a mechanism for defending against bacteriophages, the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and their associated Cas proteins were identified in the early 2000s.  Further research elucidated their functionality: CRISPR arrays record previous phage infections, while Cas proteins utilize guide RNA molecules derived from these arrays to target and cleave complementary DNA sequences within invading phage genomes.  This inherent targeting capability led to its rapid adoption as a powerful gene editing tool.  Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier's seminal 2012 work demonstrated the ability to reprogram Cas9, a particularly versatile Cas protein, to target virtually any DNA sequence, ushering in an era of precise gene editing previously unimaginable.  CRISPR-Cas9's simplicity, efficiency, and relative cost-effectiveness compared to earlier gene editing technologies like TALENs and ZFNs solidified its position as the dominant method in diverse fields, ranging from basic biological research to therapeutic development and agricultural applications.  Ongoing research continues to explore and improve CRISPR-Cas systems, including the development of novel Cas enzymes with enhanced specificity and broadened functionalities.
