Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and ionizing radiation (neutrons and gamma rays).  This energy release stems from the mass defect, a consequence of the strong nuclear force's binding energy differences between the parent and daughter nuclei.  The process is initiated by neutron bombardment, which induces instability in the nucleus, leading to its fission.  A crucial aspect is the chain reaction:  the released neutrons can induce fission in further nuclei, leading to a self-sustaining reaction, provided the critical mass of fissile material is achieved.  Control over this chain reaction is essential for practical applications.

Nuclear fission finds primary application in nuclear power generation.  Controlled fission reactions in nuclear reactors produce heat used to generate steam, which drives turbines to produce electricity.  This offers a high energy density compared to fossil fuels, albeit with significant challenges regarding waste management and safety.  Furthermore, fission has historical significance in nuclear weaponry, where uncontrolled chain reactions release immense destructive energy.  While less prevalent, radioisotopes produced through fission find applications in medical imaging and treatment, industrial gauging, and scientific research, demonstrating the multifaceted nature of this fundamental nuclear process.
