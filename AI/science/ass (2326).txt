Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of atomic orbitals, described by wave functions, resulting in a lower overall energy state for the bonded system compared to the isolated atoms.  This stabilization is a consequence of the constructive interference of electron wave functions, leading to increased electron density in the internuclear region.  Molecular orbital theory provides a framework for understanding this, combining atomic orbitals to form bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals.  The occupation of bonding orbitals, with electrons paired according to the Pauli Exclusion Principle, strengthens the bond, while occupation of antibonding orbitals weakens it.  The geometry of a molecule, its molecular structure, is determined by the interplay of several factors, including the minimization of electron-electron repulsion and maximization of orbital overlap, as predicted by Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, which is a consequence of the underlying quantum mechanical principles.  Furthermore, the strength and length of chemical bonds are directly related to the extent of orbital overlap and the resulting electron density between nuclei, quantifiable through bond order and bond dissociation energy.  Thus, a comprehensive understanding of chemical bonding necessitates a quantum mechanical perspective.
