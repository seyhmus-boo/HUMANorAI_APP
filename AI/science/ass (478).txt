Black hole formation is a consequence of gravitational collapse in astrophysics.  When a massive star, exceeding approximately three times the solar mass, exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer sustain itself against its own immense gravity.  The core implodes,  leading to a singularity – a point of infinite density – at its center.  Depending on the initial mass and angular momentum, this collapse can result in either a stellar-mass black hole or, in the case of supermassive stars or merging neutron stars, a supermassive black hole.  The intense gravitational pull prevents even light from escaping the event horizon, the boundary beyond which escape is impossible.

Although directly observing black holes is challenging, their gravitational influence on surrounding matter is detectable.  This allows for the practical application of black hole studies in several fields.  Gravitational wave astronomy utilizes signals from merging black holes to probe fundamental physics and the evolution of the universe.  Furthermore, the accretion disks around black holes emit intense radiation, detectable across the electromagnetic spectrum, revealing clues about the black hole's properties and surrounding environment.  Understanding black hole physics informs our models of galactic evolution and the distribution of dark matter, contributing to our overall cosmological understanding.
