Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of sp²-bonded carbon atoms, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties that defy conventional material science.  Imagine a single sheet of graphene, a one-atom-thick layer of graphite, seamlessly rolled into a cylinder – this is the essence of a CNT. This seemingly simple structural modification bestows upon them a unique combination of characteristics unmatched by bulk materials.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, comparable to the tensile strength of steel but with significantly lower density, can be envisioned as a microscopic cable of unparalleled robustness.  Furthermore, their electrical properties exhibit remarkable versatility; depending on their chirality (the way the graphene sheet is rolled), CNTs can behave as metallic conductors, rivaling copper in their conductivity, or as semiconductors with band gaps tunable by structural manipulation, akin to precisely engineered silicon transistors.  This dual nature provides immense potential for applications ranging from high-performance electronics to advanced composites.  Finally, their high aspect ratio and exceptional surface area, think of a tightly wound, microscopic spring, offer unique opportunities in areas such as energy storage and catalysis. This review will explore these exceptional properties in detail, analyzing their underlying mechanisms and assessing their implications for future technological advancements.
