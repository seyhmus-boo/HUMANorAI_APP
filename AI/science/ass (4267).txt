Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by the principles of quantum mechanics.  This abstract summarizes the quantum mechanical description of these phenomena, focusing on the role of electronic wavefunctions and energy minimization.  The Born-Oppenheimer approximation simplifies the problem by separating nuclear and electronic motion, allowing for the calculation of electronic wavefunctions for fixed nuclear geometries.  Molecular orbitals, formed via linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO), provide a framework for understanding bonding in molecules.  Different bonding scenarios, including covalent, ionic, and metallic bonding, arise from variations in the electronic wavefunction overlap and resulting energy changes.  The valence bond (VB) theory emphasizes localized electron pairs forming bonds between atoms, while molecular orbital (MO) theory describes delocalized electrons occupying molecular orbitals spanning the entire molecule.  Computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and Hartree-Fock, leverage these theoretical frameworks to predict molecular geometries and properties with increasing accuracy.  Understanding the interplay between electronic structure, nuclear configuration, and energy is crucial for predicting reactivity, spectroscopic properties, and other molecular characteristics.  Further advancements in computational chemistry continuously refine our ability to model and interpret chemical bonding from a quantum mechanical perspective.
