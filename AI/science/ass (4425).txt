DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring genetic continuity, involves the semiconservative duplication of the double helix.  Initiation occurs at specific origins of replication, where helicase unwinds the DNA, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the unwound strands, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate leading strand synthesis continuously.  Lagging strand synthesis proceeds discontinuously, generating Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase seals the phosphodiester backbone between Okazaki fragments, creating a continuous lagging strand.  High-fidelity replication is ensured through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and sophisticated error-correction mechanisms.  Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, pose a unique replication challenge, addressed by telomerase in germ cells and some somatic cells.  Disruptions in DNA replication fidelity can lead to mutations and genomic instability, contributing to various diseases, highlighting the critical role of this process in maintaining genome integrity.  Ongoing research continues to elucidate the intricate molecular mechanisms and regulatory networks governing DNA replication.
