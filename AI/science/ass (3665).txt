Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, sharing the same fate regardless of spatial separation.  Einstein famously derided this "spooky action at a distance," highlighting the apparent violation of locality.  Early theoretical groundwork, stemming from the work of Schr√∂dinger and others in the 1930s, laid the conceptual foundation.  However, experimental verification remained elusive until the latter half of the 20th century, with Bell's theorem (1964) providing a crucial framework for testing the predictions of entanglement against local realism.  Subsequent experiments, utilizing techniques such as photon polarization measurements, have decisively demonstrated the existence of entanglement, confirming its non-local nature.

Despite its experimental validation, the fundamental implications of quantum entanglement remain a subject of ongoing investigation.  Its potential applications are vast, ranging from quantum computing and cryptography to enhanced precision measurements.  While technological exploitation is still in its nascent stages, the profound implications of entanglement for our understanding of reality and the potential for future technological advancements solidify its position as a pivotal concept in modern physics.  Further research is crucial to unravel the full extent of this counterintuitive phenomenon.
