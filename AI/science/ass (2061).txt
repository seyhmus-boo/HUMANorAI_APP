Good morning. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a pivotal process in astrophysics.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (at least 20 solar masses).  As a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses under its own immense gravity, overcoming electron degeneracy pressure.  If the core mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, the collapse continues unimpeded, forming a singularity surrounded by an event horizon.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, likely form through a combination of stellar-mass black hole mergers and direct gas accretion onto a seed black hole.  

Understanding black hole formation is crucial for several reasons.  First, it refines our models of stellar evolution and galactic dynamics.  Secondly, the intense gravitational fields around black holes provide a unique laboratory for testing Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.  Finally,  black hole physics has practical applications in the realm of gravitational wave astronomy, where the detection of mergers allows us to infer the properties of black holes and test fundamental physics.   Further research into black hole formation continues to deepen our comprehension of the universe's most extreme objects.
