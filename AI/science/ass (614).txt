Nuclear fission is the process whereby a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and additional neutrons.  This process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the unstable nucleus to undergo asymmetric fission, resulting in daughter nuclei with varying mass numbers and the emission of several neutrons.  These emitted neutrons can then trigger further fission events in a chain reaction, sustaining the process. The energy released manifests primarily as kinetic energy of the fission fragments, subsequently converted to heat.  The precise yield and distribution of fission products are influenced by factors such as the incident neutron energy and the fissile material's isotopic composition.

The controlled chain reaction inherent in fission forms the basis of nuclear power generation.  Nuclear reactors utilize moderators to control the neutron flux and maintain a stable chain reaction, thereby generating heat used to produce steam for electricity generation.  Conversely, uncontrolled chain reactions underlie the operation of nuclear weapons, where the rapid release of energy produces a devastating explosion.  While fission's applications in energy production offer a carbon-free alternative, the associated risks of radioactive waste disposal and the potential for accidents necessitate rigorous safety protocols and ongoing research into waste management and reactor design.
