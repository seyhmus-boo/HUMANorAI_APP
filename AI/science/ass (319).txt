Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that hold immense potential for diverse applications. This presentation will review the fundamental properties of CNTs, focusing on their unique structure-property relationships.  We will examine the influence of chirality and diameter on their electronic behavior, distinguishing between metallic and semiconducting CNTs. The exceptional tensile strength and Young's modulus of CNTs, surpassing those of steel, will be discussed in the context of their potential for advanced composite materials.  Furthermore, the high thermal conductivity and surface area of CNTs will be explored, highlighting their applications in thermal management and energy storage.  Finally, we will briefly address current challenges in CNT synthesis, purification, and functionalization, emphasizing the crucial role of controlling these aspects for realizing the full potential of CNTs in next-generation technologies, including electronics, energy, and biomedical engineering.  The presentation will conclude with an outlook on future research directions and the potential for further advancements in the field.
