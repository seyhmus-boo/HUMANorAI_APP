Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional material properties rendering them attractive for diverse applications.  This presentation will review the key properties of CNTs, focusing on their structure-property relationships.  We will examine the influence of chirality and diameter on mechanical strength, demonstrating the remarkable tensile strength and Young's modulus exceeding those of steel.  The electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on their structure, will be discussed, highlighting their potential in nanoelectronics and sensing.  Furthermore, the exceptional thermal conductivity and high surface area of CNTs will be explored, emphasizing their utility in thermal management and energy storage applications.  The presentation will also briefly address challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and dispersion, crucial for realizing their full potential.  Finally, we will provide an overview of recent advancements and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field, encompassing applications in composites, energy, and biomedical engineering.
