The formation of black holes, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, necessitates an interdisciplinary approach.  Primarily, stellar evolution, a domain of nuclear astrophysics, lays the groundwork.  Massive stars, exceeding approximately eight solar masses, exhaust their nuclear fuel, culminating in core collapse.  This gravitational collapse, governed by general relativity, a cornerstone of theoretical physics, is the crucial event.  The immense pressure overcomes the degeneracy pressure of electrons and neutrons, leading to a singularity â€“ a point of infinite density.  Computational astrophysics plays a vital role here, employing sophisticated numerical simulations to model the complex hydrodynamics and radiative processes involved.  Furthermore, observational astronomy, particularly through gravitational wave detection (a recent development in experimental physics) and X-ray astronomy, provides crucial observational evidence supporting these theoretical models and allows us to infer black hole properties such as mass and spin. The study of black hole formation thus integrates stellar physics, general relativity, computational techniques, and observational data analysis, highlighting its interdisciplinary nature.
