Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  Early theoretical work by Laplace and Michell, predating Einstein's general relativity, posited the existence of objects with such strong gravity that even light could not escape.  However, it was Einstein's theory that provided the rigorous framework for understanding black holes as singularities in spacetime, regions of infinite density predicted by the collapse of stars exceeding the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.

This limit, determined through calculations considering general relativistic effects and neutron degeneracy pressure, defines the maximum mass a star can sustain against its own gravity before collapsing into a black hole.  Stellar-mass black holes, formed from the supernovae of these massive stars, constitute one formation pathway.  Alternatively, supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, are thought to form through a variety of mechanisms, including the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe or through the merging and accretion of smaller black holes.  Ongoing research focuses on refining our understanding of these processes, particularly the dynamics of accretion disks, jet formation, and the precise role of stellar evolution and galactic environments in black hole genesis.
