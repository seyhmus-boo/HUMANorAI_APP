Black hole formation is a consequence of extreme gravitational collapse within astrophysical environments.  The process typically begins with a sufficiently massive star (at least several times the mass of our Sun) nearing the end of its nuclear fusion lifecycle.  Once the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its internal pressure can no longer counteract its own gravity.  This results in a catastrophic inward collapse, driving densities to unimaginable levels.  If the stellar remnant's mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, even the degeneracy pressure of subatomic particles is insufficient to prevent further collapse, leading to the formation of a singularity – a region of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon.  Beyond this boundary, not even light can escape the black hole's gravitational pull.

While direct observation of black hole formation remains challenging, gravitational wave astronomy offers valuable indirect evidence, detecting the merger of stellar-mass black holes and the resulting spacetime ripples.  Furthermore, understanding black hole formation informs our models of galactic evolution, as supermassive black holes are thought to reside at the centers of most galaxies, influencing their structure and star formation rates.  This knowledge contributes to the development of more accurate cosmological simulations and improves our understanding of the universe's large-scale structure.
