Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, the inward gravitational pressure overwhelms outward radiation pressure, initiating collapse.  For stars exceeding the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (~3 solar masses), no known stable configuration prevents complete collapse into a singularity, shrouded by an event horizon. This process, theoretically described by General Relativity, leads to a black hole.

Recent developments refine our understanding of this process.  Gravitational wave astronomy, through observations like those from LIGO and Virgo, directly detects the merger of stellar-mass black holes, providing empirical evidence for their existence and offering insights into their formation pathways in binary systems. Numerical relativity simulations, coupled with increasingly sophisticated stellar evolution models, are improving our predictive capabilities, allowing us to explore the influence of stellar rotation, magnetic fields, and progenitor star composition on the resulting black hole properties, including mass and spin.  Furthermore, studies investigating the formation of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies are exploring alternative mechanisms, such as direct collapse from primordial gas clouds, alongside accretion from smaller black holes.  These advancements continue to shape our comprehension of black hole formation across the cosmological spectrum.
