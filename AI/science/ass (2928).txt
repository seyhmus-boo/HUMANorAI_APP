Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the process.  Imagine a highly unstable, densely packed ball – the nucleus – held together by the strong nuclear force, analogous to a tightly wound spring under immense pressure.  This "spring" is easily overcome by introducing a neutron, akin to striking the ball with a hammer.  The impact disrupts the internal equilibrium, causing the nucleus to fission, much like the spring suddenly releasing, violently breaking the ball into two smaller pieces.

These smaller nuclei, or fission fragments, possess high kinetic energy, translating to heat, and release further neutrons.  These neutrons can then trigger further fission events in surrounding nuclei, creating a chain reaction, comparable to a domino effect where the toppling of one domino initiates the fall of many others.  The rate of this chain reaction can be controlled through the use of neutron-absorbing materials, acting as dampeners to slow the cascade, or allowed to proceed unchecked, resulting in a rapid, explosive release of energy.  The efficiency of the fission process, and the resultant energy yield, depends on several factors, including the type of fissile material used and the geometry of the reaction.
