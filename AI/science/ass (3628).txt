Understanding chemical bonding and molecular structure is paramount in chemistry, yet experimental determination presents significant challenges.  Accurately predicting bond lengths and angles relies on sophisticated techniques like X-ray crystallography, which necessitates obtaining high-quality, single crystals, a limitation for many compounds, especially macromolecules.  Furthermore,  interpreting diffraction data can be complex, especially for disordered systems or those exhibiting polymorphism.  Spectroscopic methods, such as NMR and IR, offer complementary information but require careful calibration and interpretation, often needing theoretical modelling for unambiguous assignment of signals to specific structural features.  Similarly, electron diffraction and other gas-phase techniques can be challenging due to the need for volatile samples and the potential for beam damage.  The dynamic nature of molecules, including conformational changes and isomerism, further complicates obtaining a complete and static picture of structure, necessitating time-resolved experiments and advanced computational methods to account for these complexities.  Therefore, a complete structural determination often requires a multifaceted approach combining multiple experimental techniques and theoretical computations.
