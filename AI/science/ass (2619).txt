Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, a cornerstone of molecular biology with profound interdisciplinary implications.  The process, fundamentally a biochemical reaction, involves unwinding the double helix, separating the strands, and synthesizing complementary daughter strands using DNA polymerase.  This enzymatic process, however, relies on a complex interplay of physical forces, explored in biophysics, to manage strand separation and topological stress.  Furthermore, the fidelity of replication, crucial for genomic stability and evolutionary studies, is influenced by both the chemical properties of nucleotides and the structural constraints imposed by the DNA's conformation, highlighting the link with chemistry and structural biology.  Errors in replication, moreover, can lead to mutations, a focus of population genetics and evolutionary biology, impacting phenotypic diversity and species adaptation. The development of PCR technology, a cornerstone of forensic science and molecular diagnostics, directly exploits the principles of DNA replication.  Therefore, understanding DNA replication demands an integrated perspective across multiple scientific disciplines.
