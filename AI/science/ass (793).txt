Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional properties driving significant interdisciplinary research.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel at a fraction of the weight, fuels advancements in materials science, particularly in composites for aerospace and automotive applications.  Their unique electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, has revolutionized electronics, with potential for high-performance transistors and flexible displays.  Furthermore, their high surface area and tunable surface chemistry are exploited in diverse fields.  In chemistry, CNTs serve as catalysts and supports for chemical reactions, while in biology, their biocompatibility and ability to functionalize with biomolecules are leveraged for drug delivery and biosensors.  However, challenges remain, including scalable production methods, precise chirality control, and understanding long-term biocompatibility.  Despite these, the multifaceted properties of CNTs continue to stimulate collaborative research across materials science, chemistry, physics, biology, and engineering, promising transformative advancements across numerous sectors.
