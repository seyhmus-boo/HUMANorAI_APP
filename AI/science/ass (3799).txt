Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 through transmission electron microscopy, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique sp²-hybridized carbon structure.  These cylindrical structures, essentially rolled-up graphene sheets, exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNTs), each possessing distinct characteristics.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile strengths exceeding that of steel, arises from the strong covalent bonds within the hexagonal carbon lattice.  Furthermore, CNTs display exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality – the angle and orientation of the graphene sheet during rolling.  This tunable conductivity, coupled with high thermal conductivity, makes them attractive for applications in electronics and thermal management.  Their high aspect ratio (length to diameter) contributes to their unique surface area properties, leading to significant potential in areas like catalysis and gas storage.  However, challenges remain in achieving large-scale, controlled synthesis of specific CNT types and in overcoming processing difficulties associated with their high aspect ratio and tendency to aggregate.  Ongoing research continues to explore and refine techniques to fully exploit the remarkable potential of CNTs across diverse fields.
