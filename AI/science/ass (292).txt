Black hole formation remains a cornerstone of astrophysical research, bridging fundamental physics with observable cosmological phenomena.  While the theoretical framework, predicated on general relativity, has long established the conditions for gravitational collapse leading to singularity formation, significant uncertainties persist regarding the precise mechanisms and observational signatures of this process.  This paper reviews the current understanding of black hole formation, focusing on recent advancements that challenge and refine established models.  Specifically, we examine the increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations incorporating magnetohydrodynamics and radiative transfer, which provide unprecedented detail on the dynamics of collapsing stellar cores and the ejection of relativistic jets.  These simulations are complemented by improved observational techniques, allowing for higher-resolution imaging and spectroscopic analysis of candidate progenitor stars and the resulting black hole remnants.  Furthermore, we consider the implications of recent discoveries, such as the detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes, which offer unique insights into the black hole binary population and their formation channels.  Finally, the paper explores open questions regarding the formation of supermassive black holes, including the role of direct collapse and hierarchical merging, and the ongoing efforts to reconcile theoretical predictions with empirical observations.
