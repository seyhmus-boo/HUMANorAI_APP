Good morning. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission, the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus into smaller nuclei, releasing substantial energy.  This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the sum of the masses of the daughter nuclei is less than the parent nucleus, the difference being converted to energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  Historically, uranium-235 fission, induced by neutron bombardment, has been the cornerstone of nuclear power and weaponry.

However, recent developments are exploring alternative fission pathways.  Research into Accelerator Driven Subcritical Systems (ADSS) aims to enhance nuclear waste transmutation by using a particle accelerator to drive a subcritical reactor, improving efficiency and reducing long-term waste management challenges.  Furthermore, investigations into thorium-based reactors are gaining traction.  Thorium-232, while not fissile, can be converted to fissile uranium-233, offering a potentially safer and more proliferation-resistant fuel cycle. These advancements, though still in various stages of development, represent significant strides toward safer, more efficient, and sustainable nuclear fission technologies.
