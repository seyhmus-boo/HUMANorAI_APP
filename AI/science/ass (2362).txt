Catalysts in organic chemistry significantly lower activation energies of reactions, accelerating their rates without being consumed themselves.  From a quantum mechanical perspective, this catalytic effect arises from alterations in the electronic structure of reactants and the transition state.  Specifically, catalysts interact with reactants, forming intermediate complexes stabilized by orbital overlap.  This interaction modifies the frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), particularly the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO).  A catalyst might lower the energy of the LUMO, facilitating electron acceptance, or raise the energy of the HOMO, enabling easier electron donation, thereby reducing the energy gap between reactant and transition state.  Moreover, catalysts can induce specific geometric arrangements of reactants within the complex, aligning reacting bonds to optimize orbital overlap and reduce steric hindrance. This optimized geometry corresponds to a lower-energy transition state, ultimately enhancing the reaction rate via a reduction in the activation energy barrier, as evident through quantum mechanical calculations of potential energy surfaces.  The precise nature of this interaction depends heavily on the catalyst's electronic structure and its coordination with the substrates.
