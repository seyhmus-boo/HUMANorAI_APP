CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, providing a precise and efficient method for genome editing.  This technology utilizes a guide RNA molecule to direct the Cas nuclease, typically Cas9, to a specific target DNA sequence.  Upon binding, Cas9 induces a double-stranded break, triggering the cell's endogenous DNA repair mechanisms, either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), resulting in insertions or deletions, or homology-directed repair (HDR), enabling precise gene replacement.

Recent developments significantly expand CRISPR's capabilities. Base editors, combining Cas9 variants with deaminase enzymes, allow for targeted single-base modifications without double-stranded breaks, minimizing off-target effects.  Prime editing offers even greater precision, incorporating a reverse transcriptase to directly write new genetic information at the target site.  Furthermore, research is exploring the application of CRISPR in vivo, utilizing viral vectors or lipid nanoparticles for targeted gene delivery and correction in animal models, paving the way for potential therapeutic applications in human diseases.  Challenges remain, including off-target effects and delivery efficiency, but ongoing advancements continue to refine CRISPR's precision and broaden its therapeutic potential.
