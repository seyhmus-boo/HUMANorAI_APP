This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on the underlying physics and practical applications.  We will begin by examining the fundamental principles governing induced fission, including the role of neutron interactions with fissile isotopes such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239.  The concepts of critical mass, neutron multiplication factor (k), and prompt and delayed neutrons will be discussed, highlighting their significance in reactor control and safety.  Different fission mechanisms, including symmetric and asymmetric fission, and their respective energy releases will be explored.  The presentation will then transition to a discussion of the various applications of nuclear fission, primarily focusing on electricity generation in nuclear power plants.  A brief overview of reactor types, including pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs), will be presented, alongside a discussion of the challenges associated with nuclear waste management and the potential for proliferation. Finally, the presentation will touch upon ongoing research aimed at improving reactor efficiency and safety, and the potential role of advanced nuclear technologies in addressing future energy demands.
