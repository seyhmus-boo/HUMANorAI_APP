Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of carbon atoms discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991.  Their unique structure, consisting of sp²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices, underpins their exceptional characteristics.

CNTs exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, possessing tensile strength far exceeding that of steel, making them ideal for high-strength composites.  Their electrical conductivity is also remarkable, varying depending on chirality – the arrangement of the hexagonal lattice – with some behaving as metallic conductors and others as semiconductors. This tunable conductivity is crucial for nanoelectronics applications.

Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation. Their large surface area-to-volume ratio offers potential for applications in energy storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in scalable, cost-effective production and the precise control of chirality, hindering widespread implementation.  Nevertheless, the exceptional properties of CNTs promise transformative advancements across numerous fields.
