This presentation explores the rich tapestry of plasma physics phenomena and their increasingly significant interdisciplinary connections. While traditionally a core area of physics, the unique properties of plasmas – their collective behavior, strong electromagnetic interactions, and responsiveness to external fields – lend themselves to applications across diverse fields.  We will highlight key examples of this interdisciplinary synergy, focusing on three areas:  (1) Materials science, where plasma processing techniques enable the fabrication of advanced materials with tailored properties, including novel thin films and nano-structures; (2)  Astrophysics, where plasma physics underpins our understanding of stellar evolution, magnetospheric dynamics, and the behavior of accretion disks; and (3) Biomedical engineering, encompassing applications such as plasma-based sterilization, cancer therapy, and advanced diagnostic tools.  This presentation will not only review foundational plasma phenomena but also emphasize the critical role of interdisciplinary collaborations in advancing both fundamental understanding and practical applications. We will conclude by identifying emerging research frontiers and highlighting the potential for future breakthroughs driven by these interdisciplinary collaborations.
