Black hole formation represents a pivotal area in astrophysics, tracing its theoretical roots back to the seminal work of Laplace in the late 18th century and culminating in Einstein's general relativity.  This presentation will explore the diverse mechanisms leading to black hole creation, focusing on stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  We will review the classical picture of stellar collapse, detailing the necessary conditions for a star's core to overcome neutron degeneracy pressure and undergo gravitational collapse beyond the Schwarzschild radius.  The role of supernovae in this process will be discussed, highlighting the complexities of asymmetric explosions and their influence on the resulting black hole's mass and spin.  

The formation of supermassive black holes, many millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun, remains a more enigmatic area.  We will examine current hypotheses, including direct collapse scenarios from primordial gas clouds and the hierarchical merging of stellar-mass black holes within galactic nuclei. The presentation will also briefly touch upon ongoing observational efforts, emphasizing the crucial role of gravitational wave astronomy and multi-wavelength observations in furthering our understanding of black hole formation across cosmic time and mass scales.  Finally, outstanding questions and future research directions will be considered.
