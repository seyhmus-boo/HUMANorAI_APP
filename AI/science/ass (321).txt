Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a rich area of investigation. This presentation will explore the theoretical mechanisms underlying the gravitational collapse leading to black hole genesis, encompassing both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  We will review the crucial role of stellar evolution, including the Chandrasekhar limit and the subsequent fate of massive stars, culminating in the formation of stellar-mass black holes via supernovae.  The formation mechanisms for supermassive black holes, which reside at galactic centers, are significantly less understood, with leading hypotheses including direct collapse and the merging of smaller black holes.

Practical applications stemming from this research include refining gravitational wave detection models.  Accurate simulations of black hole formation and mergers are critical for interpreting signals observed by detectors like LIGO and Virgo, allowing for improved measurements of black hole properties and constraints on general relativity. Furthermore, understanding the feedback mechanisms associated with black hole accretion and jets offers valuable insights for galaxy formation and evolution simulations, impacting our comprehension of large-scale cosmological structure. Finally, the study of black hole environments has implications for the development of theoretical models of extreme astrophysical phenomena, such as active galactic nuclei and quasars.  This presentation will highlight ongoing research and future directions in understanding this fascinating and profoundly influential aspect of the universe.
