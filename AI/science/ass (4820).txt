Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized structure.  Their extraordinary tensile strength, surpassing that of steel, is a consequence of strong covalent bonding within the graphene sheets comprising the nanotube walls.  Electrical conductivity varies dramatically depending on chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour.  High thermal conductivity, along with exceptional aspect ratios, makes them attractive for thermal management applications.

However, experimental characterization and exploitation of these properties pose significant challenges.  Precise control over CNT chirality and diameter during synthesis remains elusive, leading to heterogeneous samples with variable properties.  Characterizing individual nanotube properties within a bundle is difficult due to strong van der Waals interactions, necessitating techniques like atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy for individual nanotube analysis.  Furthermore,  the dispersion of CNTs in matrices for composite applications presents a significant hurdle, often requiring complex functionalization procedures that may compromise their inherent properties.  These challenges necessitate ongoing research into controlled synthesis and advanced characterization techniques to fully realize the potential of CNTs.
