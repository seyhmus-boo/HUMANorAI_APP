DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring the faithful transmission of genetic information across generations, proceeds via a semi-conservative mechanism.  Initiation involves the unwinding of the double helix at specific origins of replication by helicases, aided by single-stranded binding proteins which stabilize the separated strands.  This creates replication forks, where DNA polymerase III, the primary replicative enzyme, synthesizes new DNA strands in a 5' to 3' direction.  Leading strand synthesis occurs continuously, while lagging strand synthesis is discontinuous, generating Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes RNA primers, replacing them with DNA nucleotides.  DNA ligase then seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, creating a continuous lagging strand.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases, which possess 3' to 5' exonuclease activity, correcting misincorporated nucleotides.  The intricate coordination of numerous proteins, including primases, topoisomerases, and sliding clamps, ensures the accurate and efficient duplication of the entire genome, ultimately preserving genetic integrity.  Dysregulation of this process can lead to genomic instability and contribute to various diseases.
