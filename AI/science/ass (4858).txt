Catalysts are indispensable in modern organic synthesis, enabling efficient and selective transformations otherwise inaccessible.  This presentation will examine key experimental challenges encountered in the practical application of catalysts in organic chemistry. We will focus on three primary areas: catalyst heterogeneity and leaching, impacting reproducibility and scalability;  catalyst deactivation,  including poisoning and decomposition pathways which reduce efficiency and longevity; and finally, the challenges associated with catalyst characterisation, particularly in complex reaction mixtures where identifying active species and understanding mechanistic details proves difficult.  The presentation will highlight specific examples from recent literature illustrating these challenges, such as the difficulty in separating homogeneous catalysts from reaction products or the unpredictable impact of trace impurities on catalyst performance.  We will also briefly explore strategies to mitigate these challenges, including the development of heterogeneous catalyst supports, improved catalyst design for enhanced stability, and the application of advanced characterisation techniques like in situ spectroscopy.  This discussion aims to provide a critical overview of the experimental hurdles that must be overcome to fully exploit the potential of catalysts in the development of sustainable and efficient organic synthesis.
