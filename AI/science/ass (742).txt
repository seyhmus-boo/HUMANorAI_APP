Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, sharing the same fate regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This linkage transcends classical physics; measuring a property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the corresponding property of the other, even across vast distances.  

Imagine two coins, magically linked.  If one lands heads, the other *must* land tails, simultaneously. This isn't simply a pre-determined outcome;  the coins' states are undefined until measured.  Before observation, both coins exist in a superposition, a probabilistic blend of heads and tails. The act of measuring one coin forces it into a definite state (heads or tails), instantaneously collapsing the superposition of its entangled partner into the corresponding opposite state.

This instantaneous correlation defies classical notions of locality, where information transmission is limited by the speed of light.  However, entanglement doesn't allow for faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of the measurement on the first coin is random; we cannot control which state it collapses into, and therefore cannot send specific information.  Entanglement's implications are profound, underpinning advancements in quantum computing and cryptography.
