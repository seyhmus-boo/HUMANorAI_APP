Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon predicted by the early formulations of quantum mechanics and experimentally confirmed in the latter half of the 20th century, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical physics;  measurements performed on one entangled particle instantaneously influence the state of the others, regardless of the spatial separation.  Einstein famously derided this "spooky action at a distance," viewing it as a violation of locality.  

The theoretical groundwork was laid by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in their 1935 paradox, aiming to demonstrate the incompleteness of quantum mechanics. Ironically, their argument stimulated further investigation, culminating in Bell's theorem (1964).  Bell's theorem provided an experimentally testable inequality, showing that any local realistic theory must yield different predictions than quantum mechanics regarding entangled systems.  Subsequent experiments consistently violate Bell's inequalities, confirming the non-locality inherent in quantum entanglement.  This has profound implications for our understanding of reality and has spurred significant research in quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
