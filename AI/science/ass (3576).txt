The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their unique electronic structure, readily explained through quantum mechanics.  Their sp²-hybridized carbon atoms form a seamless hexagonal lattice, resulting in a π-electron system delocalized along the nanotube axis.  This delocalization, governed by the Schrödinger equation for a quasi-one-dimensional system, dictates the CNT's electronic behavior.  The nanotube's chirality, defined by the chiral vector (n,m), determines its band structure; armchair nanotubes (n=m) exhibit metallic conductivity due to a zero band gap, while zigzag (m=0) and chiral nanotubes possess a band gap whose size is inversely proportional to the diameter, leading to semiconducting behavior.  Quantum confinement effects significantly influence these properties, particularly in smaller diameter nanotubes, leading to enhanced energy level spacing and impacting electron transport characteristics.  Further, the strong σ-bonds provide exceptional mechanical strength, while the π-system facilitates strong interactions with other molecules, rendering CNTs suitable for a wide range of applications exploiting their quantum-mechanical origins.  Advanced computational techniques, including density functional theory (DFT), are crucial for precise prediction and modeling of these properties.
