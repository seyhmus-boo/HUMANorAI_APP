Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy in plants and other organisms, encompasses two principal stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The light-dependent reactions, occurring in the thylakoid membranes, involve photosystems I and II, which utilize chlorophyll and accessory pigments to absorb light energy.  This energy drives electron transport chains, generating a proton gradient that fuels ATP synthesis via chemiosmosis and NADPH production through reduction of NADP+.  Water serves as the electron donor, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The light-independent reactions, situated in the stroma, utilize the ATP and NADPH generated during the light-dependent reactions to fix atmospheric CO2 into organic molecules, primarily glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  Different photosynthetic pathways, such as C4 and CAM photosynthesis, have evolved in response to environmental conditions, primarily optimizing carbon fixation under high light intensity or water stress.  Further research continues to elucidate the intricate regulatory mechanisms controlling photosynthetic efficiency and its contribution to global carbon cycling.
