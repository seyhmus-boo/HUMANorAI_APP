Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional material properties that have garnered significant attention for diverse technological applications.  This review investigates the fundamental properties of CNTs, focusing on their unique structural characteristics and the resulting mechanical, electrical, thermal, and optical behaviors.  We examine the influence of chirality and diameter on these properties, highlighting the distinctions between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The exceptional tensile strength, high Young's modulus, and remarkable electrical conductivity of CNTs are discussed in relation to their potential in advanced composites, nanoelectronics, and energy storage devices.  Furthermore, the paper explores the challenges associated with CNT characterization, purification, and processing, addressing crucial factors influencing their performance in practical applications.  By systematically reviewing the state-of-the-art understanding of CNT properties, this work aims to provide a comprehensive overview for researchers and engineers seeking to leverage these remarkable materials in future technological advancements.
