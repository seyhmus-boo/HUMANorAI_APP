Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have captivated the scientific community for their exceptional physicochemical properties.  Their unique combination of high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity, and exceptional thermal conductivity, coupled with tunable electronic properties depending on chirality and diameter, positions them as a cornerstone material for numerous advanced applications. This research paper delves into the multifaceted properties of CNTs, examining recent advancements in their characterization and manipulation.  While early research focused primarily on understanding their fundamental structure and electronic behaviour, recent developments have concentrated on addressing challenges related to scalable production, purification, and functionalization.  This includes significant progress in the synthesis of highly aligned CNT arrays through innovative techniques like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and advancements in non-destructive characterization methods such as Raman spectroscopy and advanced microscopy.  Furthermore, this paper will explore the impact of novel functionalization strategies on the enhancement of CNT dispersibility and the tailoring of their surface chemistry for specific applications, including composites, sensors, and energy storage devices.  The review will critically assess current understanding and future directions within this dynamic field.
