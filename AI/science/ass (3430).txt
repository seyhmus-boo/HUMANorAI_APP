Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges associated with characterizing the properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  The exceptional properties predicted for CNTs – high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity, and superior thermal conductivity – are often difficult to fully realize experimentally. This stems from the inherent challenges in producing and purifying CNTs with consistent structure and chirality.  

Firstly, synthesizing homogenous samples free from structural defects, such as amorphous carbon or metal catalyst remnants, remains a significant hurdle.  These impurities significantly impact measured properties, leading to discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.  Secondly, characterizing the precise chirality of individual nanotubes within a sample is technically demanding, requiring advanced techniques like high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). This is crucial as electronic properties are highly dependent on chirality.  Finally, reliably measuring mechanical properties of individual CNTs without introducing artefacts from the measurement apparatus poses a substantial challenge, often necessitating sophisticated nano-manipulation techniques.  Overcoming these experimental obstacles remains critical to unlocking the full potential of CNTs for technological applications.
