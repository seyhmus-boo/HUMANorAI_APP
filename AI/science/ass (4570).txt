Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties largely attributable to their quantum mechanical nature. Their electronic structure, dictated by the sp² hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, governs their conductivity.  Chirality, defined by the (n,m) indices describing the lattice vector, determines whether a CNT is metallic or semiconducting.  Metallic CNTs possess a linear band dispersion near the Fermi level, resulting in high electrical conductivity, while semiconducting CNTs exhibit a band gap whose magnitude is inversely proportional to the diameter.

Quantum confinement effects significantly influence CNT properties.  The π-electrons, delocalized along the nanotube axis, are confined within the cylindrical geometry, leading to quantized energy levels and distinct optical absorption and emission spectra.  The strong covalent bonding between carbon atoms results in exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, exceeding that of steel.  Furthermore, the unique electronic structure enables strong interactions with light, contributing to their potential in optoelectronic applications.  However, precise control over chirality and diameter remains a significant challenge in synthesizing CNTs with specific desired properties.
