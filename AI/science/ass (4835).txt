Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, stemming primarily from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  The Chandrasekhar limit dictates that stars exceeding ~1.4 solar masses cannot sustain themselves against gravitational pressure via electron degeneracy pressure after exhausting their nuclear fuel.  For stars exceeding several solar masses, this collapse proceeds unimpeded, leading to the formation of a singularity and an event horizon, defining a black hole.  Recent advancements in numerical relativity have significantly improved our understanding of this process, particularly concerning the complex interplay between rotation, magnetic fields, and general relativistic effects.

Furthermore, the formation pathways of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) residing at galactic centers continue to be debated. While direct collapse scenarios involving primordial gas clouds are posited, the more widely accepted model involves a hierarchical growth mechanism via mergers of stellar-mass black holes and accretion of surrounding matter.  Gravitational wave observations from LIGO and Virgo have directly detected mergers of stellar-mass black holes, providing crucial observational evidence supporting this hierarchical model.  Ongoing research focuses on refining simulations to accurately model the accretion processes, jet formation, and feedback mechanisms that influence SMBH growth and galaxy evolution, utilizing increasingly sophisticated hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations.  These developments are crucial for bridging the gap between theoretical models and observational data in unveiling the enigmatic formation of black holes across a wide range of masses.
