Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  These entangled systems exhibit a unified quantum state, irrespective of the spatial separation between them.  Measurement of a property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the corresponding property of the other, regardless of distance, seemingly violating the principle of locality. This correlation transcends classical physics, where systems are described by independent variables.  The entangled state's description requires a composite wave function, encompassing the coupled states of all involved particles, rather than individual wave functions.  Bell's theorem experimentally validates the existence of entanglement, disproving local realism.  The strength of this correlation is quantified by measures such as entanglement entropy, providing insights into the degree of non-classicality present.  Further research aims to exploit entanglement for applications in quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation, leveraging its unique capabilities for information processing and communication.
