Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy in the form of glucose, is fundamental to life on Earth.  Early understanding of the process was limited to observations of plant growth and oxygen production, with Jan Ingenhousz demonstrating in the late 18th century that sunlight was essential.  The overall reaction, 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂, was established later, but the intricate mechanisms remained elusive.  The 20th century witnessed groundbreaking discoveries, particularly the elucidation of the two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle).  The former, occurring in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, involves photosystems I and II, utilizing chlorophyll and other pigments to absorb light energy and generate ATP and NADPH.  This energy is then used in the Calvin cycle, located in the chloroplast stroma, to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic molecules, ultimately producing glucose.  Research continues to refine our understanding of electron transport chains, photophosphorylation, and the regulation of enzymatic activity within these crucial pathways, highlighting the remarkable efficiency and complexity of photosynthetic energy conversion.
