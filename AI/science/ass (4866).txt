Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them promising materials across diverse scientific fields.  Their high tensile strength and Young's modulus surpass those of steel, fueling interest in advanced composite materials for aerospace and biomedical applications.  Electrical properties range from semiconducting to metallic depending on chirality, enabling applications in electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, CNTsâ€™ high thermal conductivity facilitates heat dissipation in microelectronics and thermal management systems.  Interdisciplinary research links these properties to diverse fields. For example, their biocompatibility, coupled with high surface area, is explored in drug delivery and biosensing.  Chemical functionalization allows tailoring of CNT properties for specific applications, bridging chemistry and materials science.  Computational modelling plays a crucial role in understanding their structure-property relationships and predicting performance in various environments, highlighting the strong connection between materials science and computational physics/chemistry.  Despite challenges in scalable production and dispersion, ongoing interdisciplinary research continues to unlock the full potential of CNTs across numerous sectors.
