Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, remains a cornerstone of energy production and scientific research. This presentation provides a concise overview of the fundamental principles governing fission processes, focusing on the key factors influencing reaction rates and energy yields.  We will explore the role of neutron interactions, including prompt and delayed neutrons, emphasizing their criticality in sustaining chain reactions. The concepts of critical mass, multiplication factor (k), and effective multiplication factor (keff) will be defined and their implications for reactor design and control discussed.  Different fissionable isotopes, notably Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, will be compared regarding their fission characteristics and relative abundance.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly address the diverse range of fission products generated and their associated challenges related to nuclear waste management.  Finally, we will touch upon advancements in reactor technology aimed at enhancing safety, efficiency, and waste reduction, including the potential for advanced reactor designs utilizing thorium fuel cycles.  This overview aims to provide a foundational understanding of nuclear fission processes for a diverse audience, highlighting both their societal importance and ongoing research frontiers.
