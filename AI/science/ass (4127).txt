Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems exhibit correlated behavior regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a crucial resource for emerging quantum technologies. This presentation will provide a concise overview of entanglement, tracing its historical development from the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox of 1935, which highlighted the seemingly paradoxical nature of quantum non-locality, to the experimental verification of Bell's inequalities in the latter half of the 20th century.  We will examine the key theoretical underpinnings, including the concept of superposition and the role of entangled states in violating classical realism.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly discuss the diverse applications of entanglement across various fields, focusing on its pivotal role in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  While the fundamental understanding of entanglement continues to evolve, its practical applications are rapidly expanding, promising transformative advancements in computation, communication, and sensing technologies. The presentation will conclude by highlighting open questions and future research directions in this vibrant and rapidly progressing field.
