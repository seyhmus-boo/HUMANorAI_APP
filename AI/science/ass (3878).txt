Nuclear fission, while theoretically well-understood, presents significant experimental challenges across various stages of investigation.  Precise measurement of fission fragment yields and energy distributions remains a hurdle, demanding sophisticated detector systems capable of handling high radiation fluxes and differentiating between numerous isotopes.  The transient nature of fission, occurring on timescales of femtoseconds, necessitates advanced ultrafast techniques like laser-induced electron diffraction or attosecond spectroscopy to probe the initial stages of the process.  Furthermore,  simulating the complex multi-body dynamics of nuclear fission requires immense computational power and refined theoretical models, struggling to accurately account for the influence of shell effects and collective nuclear excitations.  Studying neutron emission, particularly prompt neutrons, requires intricate detector arrays to precisely determine their energy and angular distributions.  Finally,  experiments involving highly radioactive materials pose significant safety and handling challenges, demanding stringent safety protocols and specialized equipment. Overcoming these experimental limitations is crucial for enhancing our understanding of nuclear fission and developing safer and more efficient nuclear technologies.
