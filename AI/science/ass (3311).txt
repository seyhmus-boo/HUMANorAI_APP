The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are fundamentally rooted in their quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon atoms form a seamless cylindrical lattice, resulting in a delocalized π-electron system crucial to their electrical conductivity.  Depending on chirality – the helical arrangement of the hexagonal carbon lattice – CNTs exhibit metallic or semiconducting behaviour. This arises from the unique band structure predicted by tight-binding models, where the energy bands near the Fermi level directly influence conductivity.  Metallic nanotubes possess a linear dispersion relation at the Fermi level, leading to high electron mobility, while semiconducting nanotubes exhibit a band gap whose size is inversely proportional to the diameter, showcasing quantum confinement effects.  Furthermore, the strong covalent σ-bonding within the nanotube walls contributes to their remarkable mechanical strength and stiffness, far exceeding that of steel.  Quantum mechanical simulations, such as density functional theory (DFT), are vital for predicting and understanding these properties, allowing for the tailoring of CNT characteristics through controlled synthesis and modification.  The strong electron–phonon coupling in CNTs, also a quantum mechanical phenomenon, impacts their thermal conductivity, making them promising candidates for thermal management applications.
