Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, can be likened to a meticulously balanced stack of dominoes.  The nucleus, representing the carefully arranged dominoes, possesses a specific configuration inherently unstable due to the strong and weak nuclear forces, analogous to the precarious balance of the dominoes.  Introducing a neutron, like a slight nudge to the stack, triggers a chain reaction. This neutron's absorption by the nucleus disrupts its equilibrium, causing it to fission into smaller nuclei, much like the cascading collapse of the dominoes.  These daughter nuclei, carrying significant kinetic energy (represented by the force of falling dominoes), release further neutrons, initiating a cascade of fissions, sustaining the reaction.  The energy released in this process, comparable to the collective impact of the falling dominoes, is considerably greater than that observed in chemical reactions.  However, efficient fission necessitates careful control, ensuring a controlled chain reaction rather than an uncontrolled explosion; akin to carefully directing the dominoes' fall versus a chaotic uncontrolled tumble.  The specific characteristics of the fission products and the released neutron number vary depending on the fissile isotope and reaction conditions, mirroring the nuanced patterns observable in differently arranged domino stacks.
