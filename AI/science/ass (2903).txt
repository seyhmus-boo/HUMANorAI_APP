DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating the genome, remains a central focus in molecular biology.  The canonical model, involving helicase-mediated unwinding, primase-initiated RNA primer synthesis, leading and lagging strand synthesis by DNA polymerase, and ligation, provides a foundational understanding. However, recent advancements have refined our comprehension of this intricate process.  Studies utilizing single-molecule techniques have provided unprecedented insights into the dynamics of replication forks, revealing variations in polymerase processivity and the influence of topological stress.  Furthermore, the roles of accessory proteins, beyond the core replisome, are increasingly understood, particularly in coordinating replication with chromatin structure and responding to DNA damage.  Advances in cryo-electron microscopy have yielded high-resolution structures of replication complexes, illuminating the intricate interactions between individual components. Finally, research exploring the initiation of replication, particularly the regulation of origin firing and its implications for genome stability and cell cycle control, continues to unveil novel regulatory mechanisms and their association with diseases like cancer.  These recent developments promise a more complete understanding of DNA replication's fidelity and regulation, with implications for diverse fields from genome engineering to therapeutic development.
