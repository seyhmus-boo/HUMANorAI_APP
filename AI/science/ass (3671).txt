Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, is a process with profound implications across multiple scientific disciplines.  This abstract highlights the interdisciplinary nature of fission research.  Nuclear physics provides the fundamental framework, detailing the mechanisms of neutron-induced fission, the resulting fragment mass distributions, and the associated release of energy and radioactive isotopes.  Chemistry plays a crucial role in understanding the behavior of fission products, their chemical separation, and the long-term management of nuclear waste, encompassing radiochemistry and environmental chemistry.  Materials science is essential in designing and characterizing fuels and cladding materials capable of withstanding the extreme conditions within a reactor core.  Furthermore, engineering disciplines are critical for reactor design, safety analysis, and the development of efficient energy conversion systems.  The societal impact of fission extends into economics (energy production and cost), political science (nuclear proliferation and regulation), and public health (radiation protection and risk assessment).  Advancements in any one of these areas necessitates consideration of its consequences across the interconnected disciplines, demanding a truly interdisciplinary approach for responsible and effective management of nuclear fission technology.
