Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, is fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles.  The process initiates when a neutron, possessing sufficient kinetic energy, interacts with the target nucleus, typically a heavy isotope such as Uranium-235.  This interaction is not classical; rather, the neutron's wavefunction overlaps with that of the nucleus, leading to a probability of absorption.  Upon absorption, the compound nucleus formed exists in a highly excited quantum state, possessing excess energy significantly exceeding its ground state. This energy excess destabilizes the nucleus, weakening the strong nuclear force that binds the nucleons.  Quantum tunneling plays a critical role;  nucleons must overcome a potential energy barrier, a phenomenon classically improbable, yet readily explained via the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, allowing the nucleus to deform and eventually fission.  The subsequent fragmentation is not deterministic;  the resulting fission fragments exhibit a distribution of masses, reflecting the probabilistic nature of the quantum mechanical wavefunctions of the daughter nuclei.  The release of neutrons and the vast energy difference between the initial and final states, explained by the mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²), ultimately constitutes the observable phenomenon of nuclear fission.
