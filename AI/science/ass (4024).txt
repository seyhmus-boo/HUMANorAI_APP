DNA replication, the fundamental process ensuring genetic inheritance, is a highly regulated and accurate mechanism.  This abstract summarizes the key steps involved, highlighting the interplay of enzymes and accessory proteins.  Initiation begins at specific origins of replication, where the DNA double helix unwinds facilitated by helicases and single-stranded binding proteins (SSBs).  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing the 3'-OH required for DNA polymerase III to initiate leading and lagging strand synthesis.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, ensuring genomic integrity.  High fidelity is maintained through the 3'-5' exonuclease proofreading activity of DNA polymerases.  Prokaryotic and eukaryotic replication share fundamental similarities, although eukaryotic replication is more complex, involving multiple origins and the coordination of various replication factors.  Further research continues to elucidate the intricate mechanisms governing replication fidelity and its regulation in response to cellular stress and environmental cues.  Understanding these processes is crucial for addressing diseases arising from replication errors and developing novel therapeutic strategies.
