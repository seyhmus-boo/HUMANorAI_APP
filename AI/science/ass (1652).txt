This presentation provides a concise overview of quantum entanglement from a purely quantum mechanical perspective, eschewing philosophical interpretations.  We will begin by establishing the foundational concept of a composite quantum system and its associated Hilbert space, emphasizing the crucial distinction between separable and entangled states.  The presentation will then delve into the mathematical formalism describing entanglement, focusing on the density matrix and its properties, including the reduced density matrix and its role in characterizing entanglement.  We will explore Bell's inequalities as a crucial tool for experimentally demonstrating the non-classical nature of entanglement, contrasting their violation with the predictions of local realism.  Specific examples of entangled states, such as Bell states and GHZ states, will be presented to illustrate the diverse forms entanglement can take.  Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss the implications of entanglement for quantum information processing, highlighting its role in quantum teleportation and quantum computing, without delving into specific applications.  The overall aim is to provide a rigorous yet accessible introduction to the quantum mechanical underpinnings of this fundamental phenomenon.
