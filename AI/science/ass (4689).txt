This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on their underlying mechanisms and practical applications.  We will explore the fundamental principles governing nuclear fission, including the role of critical mass, neutron moderation, and chain reactions.  Different fissionable isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, and their respective fission yields will be discussed, highlighting variations in energy release and radioactive byproduct generation.  The presentation will then delve into the practical applications of this powerful process, primarily focusing on nuclear power generation as a low-carbon energy source.  We will examine the design and operation of various reactor types, including pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs), and briefly touch upon the challenges related to nuclear waste management and reactor safety.  Furthermore, the role of nuclear fission in the production of medical isotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes will be briefly highlighted, emphasizing its significant contribution to healthcare. Finally, the presentation will conclude by considering the ongoing research and development efforts aiming to enhance the safety, efficiency, and sustainability of nuclear fission technologies.
