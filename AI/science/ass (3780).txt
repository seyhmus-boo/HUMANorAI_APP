Good morning. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission, the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei. This process releases a significant amount of energy, primarily due to the mass defect – the difference in mass between the original nucleus and the resulting fragments.  This mass difference is converted into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².

Fission is initiated by bombarding a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with a neutron.  This neutron absorption causes the nucleus to become unstable, leading to its spontaneous fission. The resulting fragments are typically radioactive, emitting further neutrons, which can trigger a chain reaction, a self-sustaining sequence of fissions.

This chain reaction is the basis for both nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants.  In nuclear power plants, the chain reaction is carefully controlled to generate heat, which is then used to produce steam and generate electricity.  Controlled fission thus provides a substantial, albeit controversial, source of energy.  Conversely, uncontrolled chain reactions characterize nuclear weapons, resulting in an explosive release of energy.  Understanding the nuances of nuclear fission is therefore crucial for both energy production and strategic considerations.
