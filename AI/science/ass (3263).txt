Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of rolled-up graphene sheets, have captivated the scientific community since their discovery by Sumio Iijima in 1991.  This landmark discovery, initially observed in arc-discharge produced soot, rapidly ignited intense research interest due to the material's exceptional combination of mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.  Early investigations focused on characterizing the unique structure of CNTs – their chirality, diameter, and length – revealing a crucial link between these parameters and the resulting material properties.  Subsequent research has extensively explored the two primary types: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), each exhibiting distinct characteristics.  This paper reviews the fundamental properties of CNTs, encompassing their exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness surpassing that of steel, their tunable electrical conductivity ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, and their remarkable thermal conductivity exceeding that of copper.  We will further explore the influence of structural parameters on these properties, examining both theoretical models and experimental findings, and discuss the ongoing challenges and future directions in the field.  Ultimately, this review aims to consolidate current understanding and highlight the ongoing potential of CNTs across diverse technological applications.
