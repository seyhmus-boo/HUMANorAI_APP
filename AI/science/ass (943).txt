Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, presents a profound departure from classical physics.  This non-classical correlation, defying local realism, allows for instantaneous correlations between entangled particles, a feature exploited in emerging quantum technologies.  This abstract reviews the fundamental principles of entanglement, focusing on the violation of Bell inequalities as experimental evidence. We discuss various entanglement generation methods, including spontaneous parametric down-conversion and trapped ion systems, and analyze different characterization techniques like quantum state tomography.  Practical applications of entanglement are burgeoning, with significant potential in quantum computing, specifically for enhancing computational speed and security through quantum algorithms like Shor's algorithm and Grover's algorithm.  Entanglement also underpins quantum key distribution (QKD), providing secure communication channels resistant to eavesdropping. Further applications include quantum teleportation, enabling the transfer of quantum states, and quantum metrology, enhancing precision measurements beyond classical limits.  Ongoing research continues to unravel the complexities of entanglement and unlock its full potential across diverse scientific and technological domains.
