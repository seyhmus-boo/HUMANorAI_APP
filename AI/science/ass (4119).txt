Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, releases a significant amount of energy, underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry.  This process is initiated by neutron bombardment, typically of fissile isotopes such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239.  Neutron absorption induces an unstable nuclear state, leading to the nucleus's fission into fragments, accompanied by the emission of further neutrons and the release of substantial kinetic energy. The emitted neutrons can then trigger further fission events, leading to a chain reaction, the rate of which is controlled in reactors through neutron moderators and control rods.  Fission product yields exhibit a characteristic distribution, with a preference for fragments of unequal mass.  The released energy, originating from the mass defect between the parent nucleus and its fission products, manifests as both kinetic energy of the fragments and prompt gamma radiation.  Delayed neutrons, emitted following beta decay of fission products, play a critical role in reactor control.  Understanding the intricacies of fission processes, including prompt neutron emission, fission fragment mass distributions, and delayed neutron characteristics, is crucial for both optimizing reactor design and ensuring nuclear safety.  Ongoing research focuses on improving predictive models and exploring novel fissionable materials.
