Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges inherent in studying DNA replication.  While the central dogma is well-established, dissecting the precise mechanisms remains a complex undertaking.  Early experiments faced limitations in visualizing the process at a molecular level.  Techniques like autoradiography, while groundbreaking in demonstrating semi-conservative replication, provided only indirect evidence.  Resolving the intricate choreography of enzymes like helicases, polymerases, and ligases required the development of sophisticated biochemical assays and purification methods.  Furthermore, the inherent instability of many replication intermediates presents a significant hurdle.  Studying replication in vivo introduces further complexities, including the influence of chromatin structure and the regulation of replication origins.  Finally, replicating the fidelity of the process in vitro,  capturing the low error rate observed in vivo, continues to be a major challenge.  Overcoming these obstacles has necessitated innovative approaches, from single-molecule techniques to high-throughput sequencing, and continues to drive advancements in our understanding of this fundamental biological process.
