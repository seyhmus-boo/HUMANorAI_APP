Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems exhibit correlated behavior exceeding classical explanations.  This correlation persists even when the systems are spatially separated, implying a non-local connection defying classical notions of locality.  Entanglement arises from the superposition principle, where a composite system exists in a superposition of entangled states,  unseparable into individual states of its constituent parts.  Mathematically, this is represented by a state vector that cannot be factored into a product of individual state vectors.  Bell's theorem rigorously demonstrates the incompatibility of entanglement with local realism, experimentally verified through numerous violations of Bell inequalities.  Entanglement's fragility to environmental interactions (decoherence) presents a significant challenge for practical applications.  However,  progress in quantum error correction and control techniques is enabling the development of robust entangled states for applications in quantum computation, quantum communication, and quantum metrology, promising transformative advancements across various scientific domains.
