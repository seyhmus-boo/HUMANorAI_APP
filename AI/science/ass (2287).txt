Black hole formation represents a culminating stage in the evolution of sufficiently massive stars.  Following core helium exhaustion, advanced stellar nucleosynthesis ensues, ultimately producing an inert iron core that cannot sustain further energy generation.  Gravitational collapse then becomes inevitable.  If the core mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 solar masses), electron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to counterbalance gravity.  This initiates a runaway collapse, characterized by a rapid implosion compressing the core to extreme densities.  Simultaneously, a shockwave propagates outward, potentially resulting in a supernova explosion that expels the star's outer layers.  The remaining core, having exceeded the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (~3 solar masses), continues to collapse, forming a singularity surrounded by an event horizon.  The precise mechanisms governing the collapse's final stages, including the role of neutrino emission and the formation of the event horizon, remain active areas of research, with computational astrophysics playing a crucial role in elucidating these complex processes.  Alternative formation pathways, such as direct collapse of primordial gas clouds, also contribute to the black hole population observed across the universe.
