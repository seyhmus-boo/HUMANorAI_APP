Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, is a process analogous to delicately balanced dominoes.  A large, unstable nucleus, like a precariously arranged set of dominoes, requires a relatively small input of energy – a neutron, akin to a slight nudge – to initiate a chain reaction. This neutron's impact causes the nucleus to fission, splitting into smaller, more stable nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the process –  like the dominoes cascading, releasing their potential energy as kinetic energy.  Crucially, this fission also produces more neutrons, each acting as another "nudge" to trigger further fission events in neighbouring nuclei, creating a self-sustaining chain reaction.  However, the process isn't perfectly efficient; just as some dominoes might fall short of others, some neutrons escape the reaction or are absorbed without causing further fission. Control over this reaction, crucial in nuclear reactors, is achieved by regulating the neutron population, analogous to carefully controlling the spacing and arrangement of the dominoes to prevent uncontrolled toppling. This controlled release of energy harnesses the immense power locked within the atomic nucleus. The byproducts of fission, however, are radioactive isotopes, posing significant long-term challenges mirroring the lasting disruption caused by the fallen dominoes.
