Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems that persists even when spatially separated.  This correlation transcends classical physics, where separated systems are independent.  Early conceptualizations emerged from Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen's (EPR) 1935 paradox, which challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics by highlighting the seemingly paradoxical "spooky action at a distance" inherent in entanglement.  The EPR paradox stimulated decades of theoretical and experimental investigation, culminating in Bell's theorem (1964), which provided testable inequalities distinguishing quantum correlations from classical ones.  Experimental violations of Bell inequalities, beginning in the 1980s, conclusively demonstrated the reality of entanglement.  Entanglement is now a crucial resource in burgeoning quantum technologies, underpinning quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  Ongoing research focuses on extending the control and scalability of entangled systems, exploring their fundamental implications for quantum foundations, and harnessing their potential for technological advancement.  The study of entanglement continues to unveil profound insights into the nature of reality and promises revolutionary applications across diverse scientific and technological domains.
