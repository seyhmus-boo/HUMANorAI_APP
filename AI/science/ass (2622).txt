Chemical bonding and molecular structure find a rigorous explanation within the framework of quantum mechanics.  The fundamental principle lies in the reduction of the total energy of a system of atoms when they interact, forming a stable molecule.  This energy reduction stems from the constructive interference of atomic orbitals, leading to the formation of molecular orbitals.  The Linear Combination of Atomic Orbitals (LCAO) method provides a practical approach to describing this, where atomic orbitals of comparable energy and symmetry combine to form bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals.  Bonding orbitals, characterized by constructive interference and increased electron density between nuclei, stabilize the molecule, while antibonding orbitals, resulting from destructive interference and decreased electron density, destabilize it.  The occupation of bonding molecular orbitals by electrons lowers the overall energy, thus driving bond formation.  The specific geometry of a molecule is determined by the spatial arrangement of these molecular orbitals, which are dictated by the number and types of atoms involved, as well as the principles of Pauli exclusion and Hund's rule, governing electron configuration within the molecular orbitals. Ultimately, the most stable molecular structure is the one with the lowest total energy.
