Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991 using transmission electron microscopy, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique sp²-hybridized carbon structure.  These cylindrical molecules, formed by rolling a single graphene sheet (single-walled nanotubes, SWCNTs) or multiple sheets (multi-walled nanotubes, MWCNTs), possess extraordinary mechanical strength, with tensile strength exceeding that of steel.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to exceptional elasticity and flexibility.  

Furthermore, CNTs exhibit remarkable electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality – the angle and manner in which the graphene sheet is rolled.  This tunable conductivity underpins their potential in nanoelectronics.  Their thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, surpassing that of most materials, making them attractive for thermal management applications.  

However, challenges remain.  The precise control of CNT synthesis to achieve specific chirality and diameter distributions is crucial for realizing their full potential.  Furthermore, their aggregation and dispersion in matrices remain significant hurdles for industrial-scale applications.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these limitations and exploring their diverse applications, ranging from composites and energy storage to biomedical devices and sensors.
