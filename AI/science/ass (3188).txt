DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning life's propagation, has traditionally been understood through a classical biochemical lens. However, recent advancements in both experimental techniques and theoretical frameworks suggest a potential role for quantum mechanics in influencing this seemingly classical process. This research paper explores the emerging field of quantum biology, specifically focusing on the potential quantum contributions to DNA replication fidelity and efficiency. While the dominant narrative emphasizes the role of enzymes and proteins in the precise duplication of the genetic code, the inherent quantum nature of electrons and protons within the molecular machinery involved raises the possibility of quantum phenomena such as tunneling and entanglement playing a crucial, albeit subtle, role. We will investigate the evidence for quantum effects in key steps of DNA replication, such as base pairing, strand separation, and polymerase activity.  This review will critically evaluate existing theoretical models and experimental findings, highlighting areas where further research is needed to solidify the understanding of quantum mechanicsâ€™ influence on the remarkable accuracy and speed of DNA replication. Ultimately, a deeper comprehension of these quantum aspects could revolutionize our understanding of biological processes and potentially inform the development of novel biotechnologies.
