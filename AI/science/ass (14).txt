Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, have emerged as a pivotal material in diverse scientific disciplines.  Their unique structure, characterized by seamlessly bonded spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms forming a hexagonal lattice, results in a remarkable combination of strength, flexibility, and conductivity unparalleled by conventional materials. This paper explores the multifaceted properties of CNTs, highlighting the significant interdisciplinary connections driving their research and application. We delve into the mechanical resilience and exceptional tensile strength, crucial for advancements in materials science and engineering, particularly in the development of high-performance composites and nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS).  Furthermore, the investigation encompasses the remarkable electrical characteristics of CNTs, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour dependent on chirality, influencing their potential in nanoelectronics and sensors.  The paper also examines the significant thermal conductivity of CNTs, relevant to applications in thermal management and energy storage.  Finally, we discuss the crucial interdisciplinary links between materials science, physics, chemistry, and engineering, crucial for understanding and harnessing the full potential of this remarkable nanomaterial.
