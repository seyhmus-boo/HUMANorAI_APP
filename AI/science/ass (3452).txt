Nuclear fission, the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, releasing substantial energy, has been a cornerstone of both scientific understanding and technological application. While classical physics provides a framework for understanding the macroscopic energy release, a comprehensive description necessitates a quantum mechanical approach. This paper delves into the intricacies of nuclear fission processes through the lens of quantum mechanics, emphasizing the role of fundamental interactions and quantum phenomena that govern this complex nuclear rearrangement.  We will explore the crucial role of the nuclear potential, focusing on its shape and the implications for tunneling probabilities, which are central to the understanding of fission barriers and spontaneous fission. The inherent quantum nature of nucleons, including their wave-particle duality and the Pauli exclusion principle, fundamentally influences the structure of the nucleus and dictates the pathways available during fission. We will analyze how these quantum mechanical effects impact the distribution of fission fragments, the emission of neutrons, and the overall energy release, considering both the static properties of the nuclear potential and the time-dependent dynamics during the fission process. Ultimately, this investigation aims to highlight the indispensable contribution of quantum mechanics to a complete and accurate understanding of nuclear fission.
