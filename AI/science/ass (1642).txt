The process of photosynthesis, whereby light energy is converted into chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates, is fundamental to life on Earth.  Early understanding, dating back to Jan Ingenhousz's 1779 experiments demonstrating the light-dependence of plant oxygen production, laid the groundwork for later elucidation of the mechanism.  The overall reaction, 6CO₂ + 6H₂O → C₆H₁₂O₆ + 6O₂, masks a complex series of reactions broadly categorized into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (also known as the Calvin cycle). The light-dependent reactions, occurring within the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, involve photosystems I and II, utilizing chlorophyll and accessory pigments to absorb light energy.  This energy drives electron transport chains, generating ATP and NADPH, crucial energy carriers for the subsequent stage.  The Calvin cycle, located in the chloroplast stroma, utilizes ATP and NADPH to fix atmospheric CO₂ into organic molecules, ultimately producing glucose.  Melvin Calvin's pioneering work using radioactive carbon isotopes in the 1940s and 50s significantly advanced our comprehension of this crucial carbon fixation pathway.  Further research continues to unravel the intricate details of regulatory mechanisms and variations in photosynthetic pathways, such as C4 and CAM photosynthesis, adapted to different environmental conditions.
