Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  These systems, regardless of spatial separation, exhibit a shared fate, such that the quantum state of one instantaneously influences the state of the others, even exceeding the limitations imposed by the speed of light. This correlation transcends classical physics, where systems are described by independent local variables.  Entanglement arises from the superposition principle and the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum states, where systems exist in a linear combination of eigenstates until measurement collapses the wave function.  The entangled state is described by a composite wave function that cannot be factored into individual wave functions for each subsystem, demonstrating the non-separability of the entangled particles.  Bell's theorem rigorously demonstrated that the predictions of quantum mechanics concerning entangled systems contradict the assumptions of local realism, thereby experimentally validating the counterintuitive nature of entanglement.  Exploitation of entangled states forms the basis for emerging quantum technologies such as quantum computation and quantum cryptography, leveraging the strong correlations for enhanced computational power and secure communication protocols.
