Nuclear fission, the splitting of atomic nuclei, is a process deeply intertwined with numerous scientific disciplines.  This review highlights the interdisciplinary nature of its study and application.  Physics forms the core, encompassing quantum mechanics to explain nuclear structure and the strong and weak forces governing fission.  Understanding the probability and energy release of fission relies heavily on sophisticated computational models and simulations, highlighting the crucial role of computer science.  Chemistry is essential for investigating the behavior of fission products, their reactivity, and the design of efficient separation techniques for radioactive waste management, an area critically dependent on materials science and engineering.  Furthermore, the societal impact of nuclear fission, encompassing energy production, environmental effects (including the long-term geological storage of waste), and nuclear safeguards, necessitates robust input from social sciences, economics, and political science.  Finally, the development of nuclear medicine, employing fission-produced radioisotopes for diagnostics and treatment, showcases the profound connection between nuclear physics and biomedicine.  Thus, a comprehensive understanding of nuclear fission requires a truly interdisciplinary approach, integrating diverse perspectives for both harnessing its potential and mitigating its risks.
