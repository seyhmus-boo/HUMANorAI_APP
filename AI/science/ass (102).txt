Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a cornerstone of energy production and scientific inquiry.  While its fundamental principles have been understood for decades, recent developments have revitalized research in this field, driven by both the urgent need for sustainable energy solutions and the pursuit of fundamental nuclear physics understanding.  This paper reviews the current state of knowledge regarding nuclear fission processes, focusing on recent advancements that challenge traditional models and open new avenues for technological innovation.  Specifically, we will examine the ongoing refinements of nuclear data evaluations, crucial for accurate reactor simulations and waste management strategies.  Furthermore, we will discuss the progress in understanding the complex interplay of nuclear structure and dynamics during fission, including advancements in experimental techniques like the use of high-intensity laser sources and advanced detection systems.  Finally, the paper will explore emerging applications of fission, particularly in the development of advanced reactor designs aimed at enhanced safety, efficiency, and waste minimization, as well as the potential for Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) for transmutation of nuclear waste.  These advancements promise to reshape our understanding of fission and its role in addressing global energy and environmental challenges.
