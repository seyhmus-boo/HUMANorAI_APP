Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into lighter nuclei, releasing a substantial amount of energy.  Imagine a meticulously balanced, highly unstable Jenga tower representing the nucleus.  A single neutron, akin to a strategically placed finger, disrupts this delicate equilibrium.  This initial interaction triggers a chain reaction: the tower collapses, releasing its constituent blocks (fission fragments) and additional 'fingers' (neutrons).  These released neutrons then strike other "towers," initiating further collapses in a cascading effect, mirroring the self-sustaining chain reaction in a nuclear reactor.

The energy released during fission is analogous to the potential energy stored in a compressed spring. The strong nuclear force holding the nucleus together is like this spring, and when the nucleus splits, this stored energy is violently released as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons, as well as gamma radiation, comparable to the spring's rapid expansion.  This immense energy, however, requires careful control;  too rapid a chain reaction, like an uncontrolled collapse of the Jenga tower, leads to a nuclear explosion.  Reactor designs utilize control rods, acting as dampeners, to modulate the reaction rate, maintaining a controlled "collapse" for sustained energy production.
