Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon initially predicted by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in 1935 as a paradox highlighting the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems wherein their fates are intertwined regardless of spatial separation.  The EPR paradox challenged the principle of locality, suggesting that measurements on one entangled particle instantaneously influence the state of another, regardless of distance.  Bell's theorem, formulated in 1964, provided a testable framework to distinguish between local realistic theories and quantum mechanics.  Numerous experimental violations of Bell inequalities have since convincingly demonstrated the existence of entanglement, solidifying its role as a fundamental aspect of quantum theory.  Entanglement's significance extends beyond fundamental physics; it forms the basis for emerging quantum technologies, including quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation.  Further research focuses on understanding the nature of entanglement in complex systems, developing robust methods for its generation and manipulation, and exploring its potential applications in various scientific and technological domains.
