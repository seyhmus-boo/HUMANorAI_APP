Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in genome editing.  Their widespread adoption, however, is not without significant experimental challenges. While the relative simplicity of CRISPR-Cas9 design and implementation has democratized gene editing, achieving consistent and predictable results remains a formidable hurdle. This paper focuses on the key experimental limitations currently hindering the full potential of CRISPR technology.  We will explore challenges arising from off-target effects, a persistent concern stemming from the inherent promiscuity of some Cas nucleases, leading to unintended genomic modifications. Furthermore, the complexities of delivery, particularly into specific cell types or in vivo, will be examined, alongside the difficulties associated with achieving sufficient editing efficiency in various biological systems.  We will also discuss the limitations of current techniques in precise genome editing beyond simple insertions or deletions, addressing the challenges associated with larger insertions, precise base editing, and epigenetic modifications.  Finally, the paper will assess the current state of addressing these challenges and propose future directions for refining CRISPR technology and mitigating these experimental limitations.
