Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, constitutes a pivotal process in nuclear power generation and weaponry.  This lecture will examine the underlying mechanisms, focusing on the induced fission of fissile isotopes such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239.  Neutron bombardment initiates the process, overcoming the strong nuclear force binding the nucleus.  Subsequent fission events yield a range of lighter fission products, accompanied by the release of additional neutrons and a significant quantity of energy, primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and prompt gamma radiation.  The emitted neutrons are crucial for sustaining a chain reaction, a self-propagating sequence of fission events.  Control over the chain reaction, achieved through neutron moderators and control rods, is paramount in reactor design.  Further, delayed neutrons, emitted following the decay of certain fission products, play a significant role in reactor stability and control.  Finally, the lecture will address the complexities of fission product management and the inherent challenges associated with nuclear waste disposal.
