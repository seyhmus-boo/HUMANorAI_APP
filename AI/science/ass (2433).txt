This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on recent advancements and ongoing research.  We will begin by reviewing the fundamental principles governing nuclear fission, including chain reactions and criticality.  Emphasis will be placed on the role of neutron interactions and the resulting energy release, exploring different fissile isotopes and their relative merits.

Recent developments in advanced reactor designs will be a central theme.  We will discuss the progress made in Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) and their potential for enhanced safety and waste transmutation.  Furthermore, the progress in the development of Generation IV reactors, including their improved efficiency and reduced proliferation risks, will be addressed.  

The presentation will also briefly touch upon ongoing research into novel fission techniques, such as subcritical reactors and the utilization of innovative fuel cycles.  Finally, we will conclude by discussing the challenges and opportunities associated with further advancing fission technology for sustainable and safe energy production, acknowledging the critical role of nuclear fission in addressing global energy demands and climate change mitigation.
