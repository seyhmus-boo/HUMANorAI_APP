Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of rolled-up graphene sheets.  Their discovery, initially serendipitous observations in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Sumio Iijima and others, unveiled a material with exceptional characteristics.

CNTs exhibit extraordinary mechanical strength, possessing tensile strengths significantly exceeding steel's, while being exceptionally lightweight. Their electrical conductivity is highly dependent on chirality – the arrangement of carbon atoms – ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour, offering diverse applications in electronics.  Furthermore, their high aspect ratio and unique surface area contribute to exceptional thermal conductivity and adsorption capabilities.

These properties stem from the strong sp² hybridised carbon bonds forming the hexagonal lattice.  This robust structure, coupled with quantum effects arising from the nanoscale dimensions, underpins their unique behaviours.  The ongoing research into CNT synthesis and applications promises transformative advancements in diverse fields, including materials science, electronics, and energy storage.
