Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in stellar evolution, driven by gravitational collapse.  This process, primarily observed in stars exceeding a critical mass (~25 solar masses), initiates when internal nuclear fusion ceases, removing the outward pressure counteracting gravity.  The ensuing collapse is inexorable, resulting in a singularity – a point of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  The specifics of this collapse depend on the star's initial mass and composition.  Stars with masses significantly exceeding the critical limit undergo a relatively rapid collapse, potentially bypassing a supernova explosion entirely, directly forming a black hole.  Lower-mass stars, while initially collapsing, may undergo a supernova event, leaving behind a neutron star if the remaining core mass remains below the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit; exceeding this limit, a black hole forms.  The resulting black hole's mass, angular momentum, and electric charge dictate its subsequent gravitational influence on its surroundings. Further research continues to refine our understanding of the precise mechanisms and diversity of black hole formation pathways.
