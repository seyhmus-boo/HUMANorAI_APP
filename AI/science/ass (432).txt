Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential across diverse technological fields. However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  Synthesis methods, while advancing, often yield heterogeneous mixtures of CNTs with varying chirality, diameter, and length, hindering precise control over desired properties.  Characterizing these complex mixtures presents a further hurdle.  Techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy provide crucial information, but quantifying structural features with high accuracy remains difficult, especially for large-scale samples.  Moreover, processing CNTs into macroscopic structures for practical applications poses considerable difficulties.  Dispersion and alignment of CNTs in matrices, essential for achieving optimal performance in composites or devices, is often hampered by strong van der Waals forces leading to aggregation.  Finally, the precise control and manipulation of individual CNTs remains challenging, limiting the development of highly ordered architectures needed for advanced nanoelectronics.  Overcoming these experimental bottlenecks is paramount to unlocking the full potential of CNTs.
