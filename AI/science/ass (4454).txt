CRISPR-Cas systems, derived from bacterial adaptive immunity, have revolutionized genetic engineering.  Their functionality relies on a guide RNA molecule, programmed to target a specific DNA sequence, and the Cas nuclease, which creates a double-stranded break at the target site. This break initiates cellular repair mechanisms, either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), often resulting in insertions or deletions (indels), or homology-directed repair (HDR), allowing precise gene editing via a provided DNA template.

Recent developments significantly expand CRISPR's capabilities.  Base editors, fusing Cas nucleases with deaminases, enable precise base conversions without double-stranded breaks, mitigating off-target effects. Prime editing, employing a reverse transcriptase fused to Cas nickase, allows for all 12 possible base-to-base conversions and small insertions/deletions with enhanced precision.  Furthermore, research focuses on expanding the targeting range, improving delivery methods (e.g.,  lipid nanoparticles, adeno-associated viruses), and exploring novel Cas enzymes with altered specificity and activity profiles.  These advancements promise more efficient, precise, and versatile gene editing applications in diverse fields, including therapeutic development and agricultural biotechnology.
