Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, present significant experimental challenges hindering their widespread application.  While theoretical predictions suggest remarkable strength and conductivity, realizing these properties in practice is hampered by several factors.  Precise control over CNT chirality, crucial for determining their electronic properties, remains elusive in large-scale synthesis, resulting in heterogeneous samples with varying characteristics.  Furthermore, achieving high purity CNTs free from catalyst remnants and amorphous carbon is difficult, impacting performance.  Characterization techniques face limitations; accurately determining the structural parameters of individual nanotubes within a bundle requires advanced microscopy with limited throughput.  Functionalization, vital for improving dispersibility and integration into composites, can inadvertently degrade the intrinsic properties.  Finally, scalable and cost-effective purification and separation methods are needed to overcome the challenges associated with handling CNTs, particularly for applications demanding high uniformity.  Overcoming these experimental hurdles is paramount for fully harnessing the potential of CNTs in diverse technological domains.
