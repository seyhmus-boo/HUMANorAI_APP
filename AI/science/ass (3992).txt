This presentation explores the fundamental principles of chemical bonding and molecular structure, tracing their historical development and highlighting their crucial role in modern chemistry.  Early attempts to understand chemical interactions, such as Dalton's atomic theory and Kekul√©'s structural formulas, laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements. We will examine the evolution of bonding theories, progressing from the simplistic Lewis dot structures to the more sophisticated valence bond theory (VBT) and molecular orbital theory (MOT).  The presentation will contrast the strengths and limitations of each theory, illustrating how VBT explains localized bonding and MOT describes delocalized bonding, exemplified by resonance structures.  Furthermore, we will discuss the relationship between molecular geometry, predicted using theories like VSEPR, and the resulting physical and chemical properties of molecules.  Examples will be drawn from organic and inorganic chemistry to demonstrate the predictive power of these theories in understanding molecular reactivity and spectroscopic data.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon contemporary research frontiers in computational chemistry, which leverage these fundamental principles to model increasingly complex molecular systems.
