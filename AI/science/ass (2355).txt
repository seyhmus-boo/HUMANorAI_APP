Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical carbon molecules with exceptional properties, have garnered significant attention since their discovery in 1991 by Iijima.  This presentation will explore the key properties underpinning their diverse applications.  We will examine the unique structural characteristics of CNTs, including their spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices forming single-walled (SWCNTs) or multi-walled (MWCNTs) structures. This distinctive structure leads to exceptional mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel, while possessing remarkable flexibility.  Their electrical conductivity is highly dependent on chirality, exhibiting metallic or semiconducting behavior.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, making them promising candidates for thermal management applications.  The presentation will discuss the challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and functionalization, focusing on techniques like chemical vapor deposition and arc discharge.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the ongoing research exploring the potential of CNTs in fields ranging from electronics and composites to energy storage and biomedical applications, highlighting both their advantages and limitations in these areas.
