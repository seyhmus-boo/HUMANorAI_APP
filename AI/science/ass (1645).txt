Quantum entanglement describes a peculiar correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  Imagine two coins, magically linked: if one lands heads, the other *instantly* lands tails, even if they are flipped light-years apart. This instantaneous correlation, defying classical physics' locality principle, is the essence of entanglement.

Unlike classical correlations, where the outcome of one coin flip provides information about the other, entangled particles don't possess pre-defined states until measured.  The system exists in a superposition, a probabilistic blend of all possible states. Measurement collapses this superposition, instantaneously determining the state of both particles.  This isn't information transfer faster than light; rather, the particles' fates are intrinsically linked from the moment of entanglement.  The analogy breaks down slightly as the "coins" are not simply heads or tails but exist in a continuous spectrum of probabilities before measurement.  The interconnectedness, however, remains the key concept defining this fundamentally non-classical phenomenon.
