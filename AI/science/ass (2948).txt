The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their unique electronic structure, dictated by quantum mechanics.  Their sp² hybridized carbon atoms form a cylindrical lattice, resulting in a one-dimensional (1D) confinement of electrons.  This confinement leads to energy quantization, manifesting as discrete electronic energy levels.  Depending on the chirality (arrangement of hexagonal carbon rings), CNTs can exhibit metallic or semiconducting behaviour. Metallic CNTs possess a linear band dispersion near the Fermi level, allowing for high electron mobility.  Conversely, semiconducting CNTs have a band gap, whose magnitude depends on their diameter and chirality, influencing their optical and electronic properties.

The strong covalent σ-bonds between carbon atoms provide high tensile strength and stiffness, far exceeding that of steel.  Furthermore, the π-electron delocalization along the nanotube axis facilitates efficient charge transport.  The quantum mechanical description of these π-electrons, often approached using tight-binding models or density functional theory (DFT), accurately predicts their electronic behaviour and explains the unique ballistic transport observed in CNTs.  These quantum effects ultimately underpin the exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that make CNTs promising materials for diverse technological applications.
