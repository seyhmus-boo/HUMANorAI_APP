Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Its theoretical underpinnings were laid by the work of scientists like Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, culminating in their 1938 experimental demonstration of uranium fission induced by neutron bombardment. This breakthrough, initially met with some scepticism, quickly revealed the immense energy potential locked within the atom.  The process involves the absorption of a neutron by a fissile nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, leading to an unstable intermediate state. This then rapidly decays, releasing a substantial amount of energy primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments, and emitting further neutrons.  These secondary neutrons can then trigger further fissions, initiating a chain reaction. This chain reaction, controlled in nuclear reactors and uncontrolled in nuclear weapons, is the basis of both civilian nuclear power generation and the devastating destructive power of atomic bombs. The precise energy release and the nature of the fission fragments are dependent upon the specific fissile isotope and the incident neutron energy.
