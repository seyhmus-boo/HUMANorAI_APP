Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient tool for genome editing.  However, despite its widespread adoption, the implementation of CRISPR technology remains fraught with experimental challenges that limit its broader application and necessitate ongoing research.  This paper examines key limitations currently hindering the full potential of CRISPR.  We will explore the off-target effects, a major concern arising from the non-specific binding of guide RNAs (gRNAs) to unintended genomic loci, leading to undesirable mutations and potential toxicity.  Furthermore, the delivery of CRISPR-Cas components, particularly into specific tissues or cell types in vivo, presents significant hurdles, varying greatly depending on the target organism and desired application.  Inefficient delivery often results in low editing efficiency and necessitates the development of innovative delivery vectors.  Finally, the complexities surrounding the regulation of CRISPR-Cas activity and the potential for immune responses will be discussed.  Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for realizing the transformative potential of CRISPR in diverse fields, ranging from gene therapy and disease modeling to agricultural biotechnology.
