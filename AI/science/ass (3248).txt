Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, have captivated researchers since their discovery in 1991 by Sumio Iijima.  This groundbreaking observation, initially made via transmission electron microscopy within arc-discharge generated soot, unveiled a material possessing extraordinary mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, far exceeding those of conventional materials.  Iijima's work ignited a flurry of research, rapidly establishing CNTs as a subject of intense scientific and technological interest.  Subsequent investigations revealed the existence of two primary morphologies: single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), each exhibiting unique characteristics influenced by factors such as diameter, chirality, and structural defects.  This paper aims to comprehensively review the key properties of CNTs, exploring the relationship between their structural features and macroscopic behaviour.  We will examine their exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, their potential for both metallic and semiconducting behavior depending on their structure, and their superior thermal conductivity. Furthermore, we will discuss current challenges in the synthesis, characterization, and large-scale application of CNTs, highlighting potential future directions for research and development in this dynamic field.
