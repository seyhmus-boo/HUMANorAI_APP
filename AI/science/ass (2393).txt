DNA replication, the precise duplication of the genetic material, is fundamental to life. This presentation will provide a concise overview of this critical process, tracing its historical context and highlighting key mechanistic details.  Early investigations, such as Chargaff's rules and the seminal work of Watson and Crick elucidating the double helix structure, laid the groundwork for understanding replication's semi-conservative nature, experimentally demonstrated by Meselson and Stahl.  We will then delve into the enzymatic machinery driving replication, focusing on the roles of DNA polymerases, helicases, primases, and topoisomerases.  Particular attention will be paid to the complexities of leading and lagging strand synthesis, including the formation and processing of Okazaki fragments.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the significance of replication fidelity and proofreading mechanisms in maintaining genomic integrity, as well as the implications of replication errors in disease pathogenesis.  The aim is to provide a foundational understanding of DNA replication, suitable for a broad scientific audience.
