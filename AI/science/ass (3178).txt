The remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including exceptional mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, and unique thermal characteristics, are predicated on their precise atomic structure.  However, experimental investigation of these properties presents significant challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains elusive, leading to heterogeneous samples containing nanotubes with varying diameters, chiralities, and defects, confounding the accurate measurement of intrinsic properties.  Furthermore,  characterization techniques often struggle to provide a complete picture of individual CNTs within a complex matrix.  Techniques such as Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offer valuable insights but can be limited by sample preparation, beam damage, and the difficulty in isolating individual nanotubes for analysis.  The bundling of CNTs also poses a considerable obstacle, masking their individual properties and leading to difficulties in discerning the contributions of inter-tube interactions from intrinsic material behavior.  Finally, the high aspect ratio and tendency for aggregation complicate the incorporation of CNTs into functional devices, necessitating sophisticated processing techniques to achieve uniform dispersion and controlled alignment, further adding to the experimental complexity.
