Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, have garnered significant attention across diverse scientific disciplines due to their exceptional physical and chemical properties.  Their unique combination of high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity, and exceptional thermal conductivity surpasses that of many conventional materials, offering unprecedented opportunities for technological advancement.  This research paper explores the multifaceted properties of CNTs, emphasizing the crucial interdisciplinary connections that underpin their development and application. We will examine the synthesis methods, focusing on the interplay between chemistry and materials science in achieving controlled morphology and purity.  Furthermore, we will delve into the intricate relationship between CNT structure (chirality, diameter, and defects) and their resulting mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics, drawing on insights from physics and materials science.  Finally, the paper will address the burgeoning interdisciplinary field of CNT-based applications, spanning areas such as nanoelectronics, composites, energy storage, and biomedical engineering. By highlighting the synergistic interplay between these disciplines, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of CNT properties and their implications for future technological innovations.
