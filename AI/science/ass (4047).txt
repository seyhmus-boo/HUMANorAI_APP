Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional physical and chemical properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms.  Their high aspect ratio, coupled with strong covalent bonding, results in exceptional mechanical strength, exhibiting tensile strengths surpassing those of steel.  Electrical properties are highly dependent on chirality; armchair CNTs are metallic, while zigzag and chiral CNTs can be either metallic or semiconducting, offering potential for diverse electronic applications.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper, and exhibit significant surface area, making them attractive for thermal management and adsorption applications.  Their exceptional properties have fueled extensive research into potential applications ranging from advanced composites and energy storage (e.g., lithium-ion batteries) to biomedical sensors and drug delivery vehicles. However, challenges remain regarding scalable, cost-effective production, as well as addressing issues of toxicity and dispersion for practical implementation. Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these limitations and further exploring the vast potential of CNTs across various scientific and technological domains.
