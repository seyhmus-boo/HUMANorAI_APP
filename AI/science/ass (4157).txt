Nuclear fission, the splitting of atomic nuclei into smaller fragments, releasing substantial energy, represents a cornerstone of modern physics and technology.  Its discovery, stemming from the work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its interpretation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, revolutionized our understanding of nuclear structure and initiated the nuclear age.  The process, primarily driven by neutron bombardment of fissile isotopes like Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, involves overcoming the strong nuclear force to induce instability.  Subsequent fission events release further neutrons, leading to a chain reaction, the basis for nuclear reactors and weapons.  The energy released manifests as kinetic energy of fission fragments and prompt and delayed neutrons, as well as gamma radiation.  Variations in fission processes, including spontaneous fission and photofission, further expand the complexity and potential applications.  While yielding immense energy, fission also generates significant radioactive waste, presenting a critical challenge requiring ongoing research in reactor design, fuel cycle management, and waste disposal strategies.  Understanding the intricate mechanisms of fission remains vital for advancements in energy production and nuclear safeguards.
