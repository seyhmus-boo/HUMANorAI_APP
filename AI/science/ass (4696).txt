DNA replication, the process by which genetic material is duplicated, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding stemmed from the pioneering work of Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty (1944), demonstrating DNA's role in heredity,  followed by Chargaff's rules (1950) revealing base pairing ratios. Watson and Crick's (1953) double helix model provided the structural basis for semiconservative replication, a hypothesis subsequently confirmed experimentally by Meselson and Stahl (1958) using density gradient centrifugation.

The process itself involves unwinding of the parental double helix by helicases, generating replication forks.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing starting points for DNA polymerase III, which adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to continuous synthesis on the leading strand and discontinuous synthesis of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.  DNA polymerase I removes primers, and DNA ligase joins the fragments.  Telomerase maintains chromosome ends in eukaryotic cells.  High fidelity replication is ensured through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases and various repair pathways that correct errors.  Dysfunction in these processes can lead to mutations and genomic instability, contributing to diseases like cancer.  Ongoing research continues to elucidate the intricate mechanisms and regulation of DNA replication, with implications for understanding genome evolution and developing therapeutic strategies.
