Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, has underpinned life on Earth for billions of years. Early understanding, stemming from Jan Ingenhousz's 18th-century experiments demonstrating the necessity of light and plants' oxygen production, was rudimentary.  The 20th century witnessed significant advancements.  

The process is broadly divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The former, occurring in the thylakoid membranes, involves photosystems II and I, utilizing chlorophyll and other pigments to capture light energy.  This energy drives electron transport chains, generating ATP and NADPH.  Oxygen is released as a byproduct of water splitting (photolysis).  

The light-independent reactions, taking place in the stroma, utilize the ATP and NADPH generated to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic molecules, primarily glucose, through a series of enzymatic reactions.  This crucial carbon fixation powers the biosynthesis of all organic matter within the plant, forming the base of most food webs.  Further research continues to refine our understanding of this intricate process, including the roles of various accessory pigments and regulatory mechanisms.
