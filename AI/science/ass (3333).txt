The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting such intense gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical groundwork, laid by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the late 18th century, posited the existence of "dark stars," objects massive enough to prevent light from escaping their gravitational pull.  However, these concepts lacked the framework of general relativity, developed by Albert Einstein in the early 20th century. Einstein's theory provided the rigorous mathematical description necessary to understand black holes, predicting their existence as solutions to his field equations.  Subsequent work by Karl Schwarzschild provided the first exact solution, describing a non-rotating, spherically symmetric black hole.  The formation process itself hinges on the collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, the inward gravitational pressure overcomes the outward pressure from fusion, initiating a catastrophic collapse.  For stars exceeding a critical mass (typically several times the mass of our Sun), this collapse proceeds unimpeded, overcoming even the degeneracy pressure of electrons and neutrons, ultimately leading to the formation of a singularity at the center and the event horizon defining the black hole's boundary.  The specifics of this collapse, particularly the role of angular momentum and magnetic fields, remain areas of active research.
