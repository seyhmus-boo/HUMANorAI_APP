Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is a complex process driven primarily by the strong and electromagnetic forces.  This paper summarizes the key mechanisms underpinning fission, focusing on the interplay between nuclear structure and dynamics.  The process is initiated by neutron absorption, leading to an excited compound nucleus that subsequently undergoes deformation and ultimately fission.  The probability of fission versus other decay modes, such as gamma emission, is governed by the potential energy surface of the compound nucleus, and is heavily influenced by the nuclear shell structure and pairing effects.  The distribution of fission fragments exhibits distinct features, often exhibiting asymmetry, explained by the influence of shell closures in the nascent fragments.  Furthermore, the emission of neutrons and gamma rays during and after fission significantly impacts the overall energy release and subsequent reactions.  This energy release, arising primarily from the conversion of mass to energy, forms the basis for nuclear power generation and weapons.  Further research into the detailed mechanisms of fission, particularly concerning the pre-scission dynamics and fragment properties, remains crucial for improving reactor efficiency and nuclear safety.
