DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding, stemming from Avery-MacLeod-McCarty's 1944 demonstration of DNA as the hereditary material, laid the groundwork for elucidating its mechanism.  Meselson and Stahl's 1958 experiment using isotopic labeling definitively established the semi-conservative nature of replication, confirming that each daughter duplex contains one parental and one newly synthesized strand.  The subsequent identification of DNA polymerase by Arthur Kornberg, along with the discovery of other key enzymes like helicases, primases, and ligases, revealed the intricate molecular machinery involved.  Replication initiates at specific origins of replication, where the double helix unwinds, creating replication forks.  Leading and lagging strands are synthesized concurrently, with the lagging strand requiring discontinuous Okazaki fragment synthesis.  Proofreading mechanisms, inherent to DNA polymerases, ensure high fidelity, minimizing errors and maintaining genomic integrity.  The precise coordination of these numerous proteins and processes ensures accurate and efficient genome duplication, a vital prerequisite for cell division and the transmission of genetic information.  Ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of replication, particularly its regulation and its roles in genomic stability and disease.
