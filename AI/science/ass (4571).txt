Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them attractive for diverse technological applications.  Their unique structure, consisting of seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets, dictates their remarkable characteristics.  Single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) display high tensile strength exceeding that of steel, coupled with exceptional flexibility and a high aspect ratio.  Electrical conductivity in SWCNTs is strongly dependent on their chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, offering potential for advanced electronics and nano-scale devices.  Multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) possess similar mechanical strength but exhibit lower electrical conductivity.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, making them promising for thermal management applications. However, challenges remain in controlling CNT synthesis to achieve desired chirality and purity, as well as in scalable and cost-effective processing for large-scale integration into devices.  Future research focuses on overcoming these limitations to fully realize the potential of CNTs across various fields, including composites, energy storage, sensors, and biomedical engineering.
