Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, stems from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  Early theoretical groundwork, notably by Michell and Laplace in the 18th century, posited the existence of objects so dense that even light could not escape their gravitational pull.  However, a rigorous understanding emerged only with Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, which provided the framework for describing the extreme spacetime curvature associated with black holes.

The process begins with the stellar death of stars exceeding a critical mass (typically several times the mass of the Sun).  Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel, the inward gravitational force overcomes the outward pressure, initiating a catastrophic collapse.  For stars within a certain mass range, this leads to the formation of neutron stars.  However, stars exceeding the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, approximately 2-3 solar masses, undergo unrestrained collapse, forming a singularity – a point of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  While observational evidence, such as gravitational waves and X-ray emissions from accretion disks, strongly supports their existence, directly observing the event horizon remains a challenge.  Ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of the intricate physics governing black hole formation and evolution, including the role of rotation and magnetic fields.
