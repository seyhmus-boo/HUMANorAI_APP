DNA replication, the semi-conservative duplication of the genome, presents significant experimental challenges.  Precisely monitoring the process in vivo is hampered by its inherent speed and the complexity of the cellular environment.  Distinguishing between newly synthesized and parental DNA strands requires sophisticated labelling techniques, such as using isotopes like <sup>15</sup>N or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), which can be challenging to implement without introducing artefacts.  Furthermore,  isolating and purifying the replication machinery – comprising DNA polymerases, helicases, primases, and other accessory proteins – without compromising their activity remains a technical hurdle.  Studying the replication process in specific genomic regions or under particular conditions (e.g., stress response) necessitates advanced techniques like chromosome conformation capture (3C) or live-cell imaging,  both of which pose significant analytical complexities.  Finally, the high fidelity of replication makes the detection of rare errors, crucial for understanding mutagenesis and disease, extremely difficult, demanding sensitive assays with minimal background noise.  Overcoming these hurdles is essential for advancing our understanding of this fundamental biological process.
