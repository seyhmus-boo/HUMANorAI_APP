DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring genetic inheritance, presents significant experimental challenges despite decades of research.  This presentation will explore key difficulties encountered in studying this intricate process in vivo and in vitro.  Specifically, we will address the limitations in accurately capturing the dynamic nature of replication forks, including the transient interactions of numerous proteins and the inherent heterogeneity of replication origins.  Visualizing and quantifying these fleeting interactions remains a significant hurdle, often requiring sophisticated techniques like single-molecule imaging and advanced microscopy, which themselves present limitations in resolution and throughput.  Furthermore, accurately modelling the complex interplay of factors affecting replication fidelity and speed, such as nucleotide availability, DNA topology, and the presence of DNA lesions, poses a considerable challenge.  We will discuss recent advancements addressing these challenges, including the development of novel in vitro replication systems, improved imaging techniques, and advanced computational modelling, whilst highlighting remaining obstacles and future research directions crucial to a complete understanding of DNA replication.
