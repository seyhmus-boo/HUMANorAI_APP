Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized structure.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to remarkable tensile strength and Young's modulus, far exceeding those of steel.  Excellent electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, is another key feature, promising applications in electronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.

However, experimental characterization and manipulation of CNTs pose significant challenges.  Precise control over chirality during synthesis remains elusive, leading to heterogeneous samples with variable properties.  The strong van der Waals forces between individual nanotubes cause bundling, hindering dispersion and hindering the realization of their individual properties in macroscopic applications.  Accurate measurement of individual nanotube properties is complicated by this aggregation, requiring advanced microscopy techniques and sophisticated sample preparation.  Furthermore, purification to remove metallic impurities from semiconducting nanotubes, crucial for electronic device fabrication, is a significant technological hurdle.  Overcoming these challenges is essential for realizing the full potential of CNTs across diverse technological fields.
