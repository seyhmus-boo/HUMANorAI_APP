Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon arising from the superposition principle, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical locality, exhibiting strong correlations even when spatially separated systems are measured.  Entanglement is quantified by measures such as concurrence and entanglement entropy, which reflect the degree of non-classical correlations.  Experimental verification of entanglement relies on Bell inequality violations, demonstrating that the observed correlations surpass any classical explanation.  Different types of entanglement exist, including Bell states and Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states, characterized by distinct entanglement properties and varying degrees of robustness to decoherence.  Applications of entangled states are rapidly expanding, encompassing quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  However, the fundamental nature of entanglement and the precise mechanism by which it arises remain active areas of theoretical research, with ongoing investigations exploring potential connections to deeper aspects of quantum mechanics and spacetime.  Future directions involve developing more sophisticated entanglement manipulation techniques and exploring novel applications leveraging its non-classical correlations.
