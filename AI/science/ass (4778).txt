Nuclear fission, the splitting of an atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in nuclear physics.  The process, first observed experimentally in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, and subsequently interpreted theoretically by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, marked a profound shift in our understanding of atomic structure and energy release.  Their work, building upon earlier experiments involving neutron bombardment of uranium, revealed the unexpected fission of uranium-235 nuclei into smaller fragments, accompanied by the release of a significant amount of energy and further neutrons.  This chain reaction, where the released neutrons trigger further fission events, became the foundation for both nuclear weapons and nuclear power generation.  The immense energy yield stems from the mass defect, a slight difference in mass between the original nucleus and the resulting fragments, converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  Understanding the mechanisms driving fission, including the role of neutron energy and the resulting distribution of fission products, is crucial for controlling the reaction's rate and preventing uncontrolled chain reactions.  Subsequent research extensively explored different fissile isotopes and the optimization of reactor designs for efficient energy extraction.
