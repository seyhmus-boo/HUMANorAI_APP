Good morning. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a fascinating area of ongoing astrophysical research.  Stellar-mass black holes, the most common type, originate from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses.  Once nuclear fusion ceases, the star's core implodes, overcoming degeneracy pressure, and ultimately forming a singularity surrounded by an event horizon.

Recent advancements have significantly improved our understanding of this process.  Numerical simulations, incorporating increasingly sophisticated equations of state, are providing greater accuracy in modeling the collapse dynamics, revealing detailed information about the resulting black hole's properties, such as spin and mass.  Furthermore, gravitational wave observations from merging black holes, facilitated by detectors like LIGO and Virgo, offer empirical data to constrain theoretical models, particularly regarding the pre-collapse state of the progenitor stars and the intricacies of the merger process.  These combined observational and theoretical approaches are steadily refining our comprehension of black hole formation, shedding light on the interplay between stellar evolution and the birth of these enigmatic objects.
