DNA replication, the process by which a cell creates an identical copy of its DNA, is a fundamental process for life, ensuring the faithful transmission of genetic information across generations.  Early understanding of replication emerged from experiments conducted in the mid-20th century.  Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty's 1944 demonstration that DNA, not protein, carried hereditary information laid crucial groundwork.  Subsequently, the Hershey-Chase experiment (1952) further solidified DNA's role.  However, the precise mechanism remained elusive until the elucidation of the double-helix structure by Watson and Crick in 1953. Their model, incorporating complementary base pairing, immediately suggested a semi-conservative mechanism: each strand of the parental DNA molecule serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.  This hypothesis was experimentally confirmed by Meselson and Stahl in 1958, using density gradient centrifugation to distinguish between different generations of DNA molecules.  This foundational work established the semi-conservative nature of replication, forming the basis for our current understanding of this intricate and highly regulated process involving a complex interplay of enzymes and proteins.
