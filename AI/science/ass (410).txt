Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, represents a significant process with profound practical implications.  This review summarizes its key aspects.  The process, typically initiated by neutron bombardment of fissile isotopes like Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, releases vast amounts of energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence. This energy release is accompanied by the emission of further neutrons, enabling chain reactions â€“ the fundamental principle behind nuclear reactors and weapons.

Reactor designs vary widely, from pressurized water reactors (PWRs) dominant in electricity generation to breeder reactors capable of producing more fissile material than they consume.  The efficacy of fission relies heavily on neutron moderation and control, crucial for maintaining a stable chain reaction and preventing uncontrolled escalation.

Practical applications are primarily focused on energy production, powering numerous nuclear power plants globally.  Beyond electricity generation, fission finds application in medical isotopes for diagnosis and treatment (e.g., radioisotopes for imaging and cancer therapy), as well as industrial uses such as materials analysis and sterilization. However, the inherent risks associated with radioactive waste disposal and the potential for weapons proliferation remain significant challenges requiring continued research and stringent safety protocols.
