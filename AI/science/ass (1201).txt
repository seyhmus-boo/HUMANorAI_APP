The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime with such intense gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical groundwork, stemming from John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace's 18th-century conceptions of "dark stars," posited the existence of objects whose gravity was too strong for light to overcome.  However, it was Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in the early 20th century that provided the robust theoretical framework for understanding black hole formation.

Collapse to a black hole occurs when a sufficiently massive star exhausts its nuclear fuel.  Without the outward pressure of fusion to counteract inward gravitational pull, the core collapses under its own weight.  If the stellar remnant's mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), even the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is insufficient to prevent further collapse.  This runaway process leads to the formation of a singularity – a point of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which escape is impossible.  Different progenitor star masses and rotation rates influence the resulting black hole's properties, leading to a diverse population observed through their gravitational effects on surrounding matter.
