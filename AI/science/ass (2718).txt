Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, promising revolutionary advancements across diverse fields.  However, realizing the full potential of CNTs remains hampered by significant experimental challenges. This research paper focuses on these critical hurdles that impede the reliable characterization and controlled manipulation of CNTs, thereby limiting their widespread technological application.  The inherent challenges stem from several factors including the complex production methods leading to a heterogeneous mixture of tube diameters, chiralities, and structural defects.  Precise control over these parameters is crucial as they directly influence the final properties of the material.  Furthermore, accurate characterization of individual CNT properties within a sample, particularly for chirality determination, remains technologically demanding.  The tendency for CNTs to aggregate due to van der Waals forces presents another significant challenge, hindering effective dispersion and influencing macroscopic material behaviour.  This paper will explore these experimental limitations, examining existing characterization techniques,  analyzing the impact of sample heterogeneity, and discussing strategies for overcoming these challenges to unlock the true potential of CNTs in future applications.
