Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamental concepts underpinning our understanding of chemistry and materials science.  While theoretical models provide valuable insights into the nature of chemical bonds and the resulting three-dimensional arrangements of atoms, accurately determining and characterizing these structures experimentally remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the experimental hurdles encountered in elucidating detailed molecular structures and the strengths and limitations of various techniques employed.  Challenges range from the inherent limitations of instrumentation, such as resolution and sensitivity, to the intrinsic properties of the molecules themselves, including their size, stability, and reactivity.  Diffraction techniques, including X-ray, neutron, and electron diffraction, while powerful, often struggle with disordered systems or require specialized sample preparation.  Spectroscopic methods, such as NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, provide valuable complementary information but may be susceptible to spectral overlap and require sophisticated data analysis.  Furthermore, the investigation of transient species or molecules in complex environments presents additional experimental complexities. This review will examine these challenges, highlighting recent advancements in experimental techniques and methodologies that aim to overcome these limitations and provide increasingly accurate and detailed descriptions of chemical bonding and molecular structure.
