Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized bonding and high aspect ratio.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, with Young's modulus exceeding that of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility, makes them attractive for composite reinforcement.  High electrical conductivity, comparable to copper, and tunable band gaps depending on chirality and diameter, position CNTs for applications in electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, their high surface area leads to significant potential in energy storage, catalysis, and drug delivery.

Recent developments focus on controlled synthesis techniques, enabling precise control over chirality and diameter distribution for optimized properties.  Significant progress has been made in scalable production methods, addressing the challenges of cost-effective large-scale manufacturing.  Research also investigates functionalization strategies, modifying CNT surfaces to enhance compatibility with various matrices and improve dispersibility, crucial for realizing their full potential in diverse applications.  Finally,  studies are exploring the use of CNTs in advanced technologies like flexible electronics, high-performance computing, and bio-integrated devices, driven by ongoing improvements in their synthesis and manipulation.
