Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a complex and actively researched area.  This review summarizes current understanding of the process, focusing on the two primary pathways: stellar-mass black hole formation through the core-collapse of massive stars and supermassive black hole formation via direct collapse or hierarchical merging of smaller black holes.  While stellar-mass black hole formation is relatively well-understood,  significant uncertainties persist regarding the precise progenitor star properties and the influence of rotation and magnetic fields on the collapse dynamics.  The origin of supermassive black holes, particularly those observed at high redshifts, presents a greater challenge.  Seed black hole formation mechanisms, including direct collapse of massive gas clouds and the rapid growth of intermediate-mass black holes, are debated extensively. Numerical simulations, employing increasingly sophisticated models of hydrodynamics, gravity, and magnetohydrodynamics, continue to refine our comprehension of these processes.  However, significant observational constraints are needed to further discriminate between competing theoretical models and fully elucidate the intricate physics governing black hole birth.  Future research should focus on multi-messenger astronomy, combining gravitational wave detections with electromagnetic observations, to provide a more holistic perspective on black hole formation across cosmic timescales.
