Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile strength exceeding that of steel, arises from the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheets and their seamless cylindrical structure.  This strength, coupled with their low density, makes them attractive for lightweight, high-strength composites.

CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, varying from metallic to semiconducting depending on their chirality (the angle of the hexagonal lattice's roll-up).  This tunable conductivity has implications for nanoelectronics and sensor applications.  Furthermore, their high aspect ratio leads to significant surface area, making them ideal for applications such as energy storage (supercapacitors, batteries) and catalysis.  Their thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, offering potential for thermal management in electronic devices.  However, challenges remain in achieving large-scale, cost-effective production and in controlling the precise chirality and structural uniformity crucial for many applications.  Ongoing research continues to explore and refine methods to fully exploit the remarkable potential of CNTs.
