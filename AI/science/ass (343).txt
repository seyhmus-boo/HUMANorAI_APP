Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become interconnected, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation surpasses classical physics; measuring a property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the corresponding property of the other, even across vast distances.  This "spooky action at a distance," as Einstein termed it,  challenges the principle of locality, suggesting non-local correlations exist in the quantum realm.

The theoretical groundwork for entanglement was laid in the 1930s with the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, which argued that quantum mechanics was incomplete due to the seemingly instantaneous action at a distance implied by entanglement.  However, John Bell's theorem (1964) provided a testable inequality, allowing experimental verification of entanglement's non-local nature.  Subsequent experiments, notably those by Alain Aspect in the 1980s, have consistently violated Bell's inequality, confirming the reality of quantum entanglement and its violation of classical intuition.  Entanglement now forms the basis for emerging quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
