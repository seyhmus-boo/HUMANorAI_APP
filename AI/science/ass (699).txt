Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the fundamental mechanisms of photosynthesis.  Historically, the understanding of this process evolved gradually.  Early researchers, like Jan Ingenhousz in the late 18th century, demonstrated the role of light in plant growth, while the contributions of  van Niel in the 20th century solidified the concept of photosynthesis as a light-driven redox reaction.

At the heart of photosynthesis lies the conversion of light energy into chemical energy.  This occurs in two primary stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (the Calvin cycle). In the light-dependent reactions, photosystems II and I, embedded within thylakoid membranes, capture light energy, driving electron transport chains that generate ATP and NADPH.  Oxygen is a byproduct of this process, released through the oxidation of water.  

The subsequent Calvin cycle, occurring in the stroma, utilizes the ATP and NADPH generated to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into glucose, a stable form of chemical energy. This intricate interplay of light capture, electron transfer, and carbon fixation underpins the very foundation of most terrestrial ecosystems.
