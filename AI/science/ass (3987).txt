Quantum entanglement, a counter-intuitive phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum particles wherein their fates are inextricably linked, regardless of spatial separation.  This interconnectedness manifests in the violation of Bell's inequalities, demonstrating a departure from classical physics' local realism.  Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the state of the other, irrespective of distance, leading to Einstein's famous characterization as "spooky action at a distance."  The underlying mechanism involves the particles sharing a composite quantum state, described by a superposition until measurement collapses the wave function.

Practical applications of entanglement are burgeoning. Quantum computing leverages entangled qubits for enhanced computational power, enabling the exploration of problems intractable for classical computers, such as drug discovery and materials science.  Quantum cryptography utilizes entanglement to create unbreakable encryption keys, securing communication channels through the principle of quantum key distribution.  Furthermore, entanglement finds applications in quantum teleportation, enabling the transfer of quantum states between distant locations, and precision metrology, improving the sensitivity of measurements in fields like gravitational wave detection.  However, maintaining entanglement over significant distances remains a technological challenge, limiting widespread implementation.
