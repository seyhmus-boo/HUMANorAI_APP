Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the formation of black holes, a topic of continued intense research in astrophysics.  Classically, stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses.  When nuclear fusion ceases, the star's core implodes under its own weight, overcoming electron and neutron degeneracy pressure.  This catastrophic collapse leads to a singularity hidden behind an event horizon, forming a black hole.

Recent advancements refine our understanding of this process.  Gravitational wave observations by LIGO and Virgo have directly detected the merger of stellar-mass black holes, providing crucial data on their masses and spins, hinting at formation scenarios more complex than simple single-star collapse.  Furthermore, advancements in numerical relativity simulations allow for more accurate modeling of the collapse process, including the impact of stellar rotation and magnetic fields on the final black hole properties.  These simulations are crucial in bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and observational data, revealing the complexities of black hole formation and its dependence on the progenitor starâ€™s properties.  Further investigation into the formation of supermassive black holes at galactic centres remains a key area of ongoing research.
