Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, can be conceptually understood through the analogy of a carefully balanced, highly unstable stack of dominoes.  Each domino represents a nucleon (proton or neutron) within the nucleus, and the entire stack represents the unstable, fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235.  A slight perturbation, analogous to the impact of a single neutron, initiates a chain reaction.  This initial neutron “knocks down” a domino, representing the nucleus absorbing the neutron and becoming even more unstable.  The subsequent collapse of this “domino” – the fission event – releases energy and, critically, more neutrons, which act as the “knocking force” on adjacent dominoes. These newly released neutrons trigger further fissions, creating a cascading effect, much like a chain reaction propagating through the domino stack.  The energy released in each fission event corresponds to the potential energy stored within the precarious configuration of the domino stack; the dramatic release of this energy is analogous to the rapid collapse of the stack.  However, control mechanisms, like strategically placed barriers in the domino analogy, are crucial in nuclear reactors to regulate the chain reaction and prevent an uncontrolled, catastrophic release of energy.  Without these controls, the chain reaction becomes exponential, akin to a uncontrolled cascade of falling dominoes.
