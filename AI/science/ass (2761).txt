Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms.  Their discovery revolutionized materials science, opening avenues for diverse applications.  CNTs exhibit extraordinary mechanical strength, boasting tensile strengths far exceeding that of steel, alongside exceptional flexibility.  Their electrical conductivity varies dramatically depending on chirality (the arrangement of carbon atoms), ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour. This tunability is crucial for electronics applications.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  

However, challenges remain.  Precise control over CNT chirality and diameter during synthesis is crucial for tailoring properties.  Additionally, bundling and aggregation tendencies necessitate effective dispersion techniques for practical use.  Despite these limitations, the remarkable combination of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties makes CNTs a subject of ongoing intense research, with significant potential across fields such as composites, electronics, energy storage, and biomedical engineering.  Further exploration into scalable, controlled synthesis and processing methods will unlock their full potential.
