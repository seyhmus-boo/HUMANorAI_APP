The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting gravitational effects so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape, remains a central problem in astrophysics.  Early theoretical groundwork, stemming from John Michell's and Pierre-Simon Laplace's 18th-century speculations on "dark stars," provided the initial conceptual framework.  However, the rigorous theoretical understanding emerged only with the advent of Einstein's general theory of relativity in 1915, which predicted the existence of black holes as solutions to the field equations under specific conditions of extreme gravitational collapse.  Karl Schwarzschild's subsequent derivation of the first exact solution further solidified this theoretical foundation.

Despite these theoretical advancements, observational confirmation remained elusive for decades.  The initial identification of black hole candidates relied on indirect methods, focusing on the observation of highly energetic phenomena associated with accreting matter, such as X-ray binaries and active galactic nuclei (AGN).  Recent advancements in gravitational wave astronomy, notably the detection of binary black hole mergers by LIGO and Virgo, have provided direct evidence, confirming the existence of black holes and offering unique insights into their formation and dynamics.  This paper will review the current understanding of black hole formation, exploring various mechanisms, including the collapse of massive stars, the merger of stellar-mass black holes, and the potential formation of primordial black holes in the early universe.  We will also discuss the limitations of current models and highlight key areas for future research.
