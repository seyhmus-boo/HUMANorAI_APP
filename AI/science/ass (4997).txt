Plasma physics encompasses a diverse range of phenomena arising from the collective behavior of ionized gases.  This lecture will survey key aspects of this field, focusing on fundamental processes and macroscopic manifestations.  We will initially explore the microscopic interactions governing plasma dynamics, including Coulomb collisions and the influence of electromagnetic fields on charged particle motion, leading to concepts such as Debye shielding and plasma oscillations.  Subsequently, the lecture will address macroscopic phenomena, including plasma waves (e.g., Langmuir waves, ion acoustic waves), instabilities (e.g., two-stream instability, drift-wave instability), and their crucial roles in energy transport and particle acceleration.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the applications of plasma physics, encompassing controlled thermonuclear fusion, space physics, and materials processing, highlighting the inherent complexity and ongoing research in this multifaceted discipline.  A qualitative overview will be provided, with select examples to illustrate core concepts.
