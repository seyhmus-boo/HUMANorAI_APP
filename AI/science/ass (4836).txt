This presentation explores the quantum mechanical underpinnings of nuclear fission processes.  We move beyond the classical liquid-drop model, highlighting the crucial role of quantum tunneling in initiating fission.  The presentation will delve into the probabilistic nature of nuclear decay, focusing on the quantum mechanical calculation of fission barriers and their dependence on nuclear shape deformations.  Specific attention will be paid to the impact of shell effects, arising from the quantization of nucleon energies, on the stability and fissionability of nuclei.  We will examine how the independent particle model, while offering a simplified picture, provides valuable insights into the single-particle levels and their influence on fission fragment distributions. Furthermore,  we will discuss the challenges and advances in applying advanced quantum many-body methods, such as density functional theory, to accurately predict fission observables, including the energy release and the distribution of fission fragments. The presentation will conclude by briefly outlining current research directions and open questions in the quantum mechanical description of nuclear fission, emphasizing the need for further development of theoretical frameworks capable of incorporating complex correlations between nucleons.
