Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure and nanoscale dimensions.  Their mechanical properties, characterized by extraordinary tensile strength and Young's modulus exceeding that of steel, are of significant interest to materials science and engineering, enabling applications in lightweight, high-strength composites.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable electrical properties, demonstrating either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality, which influences their potential in nanoelectronics and sensors.  Their high surface area contributes to exceptional adsorption capabilities, relevant to environmental science and catalysis research.  

The interdisciplinary nature of CNT research is evident.  Chemistry plays a crucial role in synthesizing and functionalizing CNTs, while physics underpins the understanding of their electronic and vibrational properties.  Materials science focuses on incorporating CNTs into composite materials, while engineering explores their applications in diverse technologies.  Biological applications are emerging, leveraging their biocompatibility and unique surface properties for drug delivery and biosensing.  Thus, the study of CNTs requires a multidisciplinary approach, integrating knowledge across various fields to fully exploit their potential.
