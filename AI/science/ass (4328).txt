Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked regardless of spatial separation, remains a subject of intense experimental investigation.  While theoretical predictions are robust, realizing and harnessing entanglement presents significant challenges.  Experimental verification often requires precise control over individual quantum systems, typically achieved through techniques such as laser cooling and trapping, or superconducting circuits. Maintaining entanglement over extended periods is problematic, as decoherence – interaction with the environment – rapidly destroys the delicate quantum superposition.  This necessitates the development of sophisticated isolation techniques, minimizing noise and environmental interference.  Furthermore, scaling up the number of entangled particles, crucial for applications in quantum computing and communication, poses a major hurdle.  The difficulty lies in maintaining entanglement fidelity across a large ensemble, compounded by the increased susceptibility to decoherence.  Finally,  characterizing and quantifying entanglement with high precision remains a complex task, requiring advanced measurement techniques and sophisticated statistical analysis.  Overcoming these experimental limitations is paramount for realizing the full potential of quantum entanglement across diverse scientific fields.
