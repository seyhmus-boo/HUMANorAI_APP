The concept of chemical bonding, underpinning the structure and properties of molecules, evolved significantly throughout the 20th century. Early attempts, such as the valence bond theory developed in the 1920s, focused on localized electron pairs shared between atoms, successfully explaining the formation of covalent bonds.  This theory, however, struggled to account for the delocalized nature of electrons in molecules like benzene.  Subsequently, molecular orbital (MO) theory emerged as a more comprehensive framework, treating electrons as occupying molecular orbitals encompassing the entire molecule. This approach, rooted in quantum mechanics, provided a more accurate depiction of bonding in polyatomic molecules, particularly those exhibiting resonance structures.  The interplay between valence bond and molecular orbital theories offers a powerful toolset for understanding molecular geometry, bond lengths, and bond energies.  Further advancements, such as density functional theory (DFT), have refined computational approaches to predicting molecular structures and properties with increasing accuracy, allowing for the investigation of increasingly complex systems and fostering the growth of fields like materials science and drug design.  The evolution of these theories demonstrates the dynamic interplay between experimental observation and theoretical modelling in our understanding of chemical bonding.
