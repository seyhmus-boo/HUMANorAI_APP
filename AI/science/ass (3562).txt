Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties rendering them attractive for diverse applications.  This presentation will overview the key characteristics defining CNT functionality, focusing on their structural dependence.  We will examine the influence of chirality and diameter on electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour, a critical factor in their use in electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, the exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness of CNTs, stemming from strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds, will be discussed, highlighting their potential in advanced materials such as composites.  The presentation will also touch upon the unique thermal properties of CNTs, including high thermal conductivity and stability at elevated temperatures.  Finally, challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and dispersion, limiting widespread implementation, will be briefly addressed.  The overall aim is to provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of the fundamental properties of CNTs, emphasizing their potential and the ongoing efforts to overcome limitations for their widespread technological adoption.
