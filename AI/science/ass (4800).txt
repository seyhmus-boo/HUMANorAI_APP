Black hole formation represents a pivotal point in astrophysical evolution, marking the ultimate fate of sufficiently massive stars. This presentation will explore the theoretical and observational understanding of this process, tracing its historical development from theoretical predictions to current observational confirmations.  Early conceptualizations, originating from John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century, envisioned "dark stars" based on Newtonian gravity.  However, Einstein's theory of General Relativity provided the rigorous framework for understanding black holes as regions of spacetime with extreme gravitational curvature, predicted to form from gravitational collapse.

The presentation will detail the key stages of stellar evolution leading to black hole formation:  nuclear fusion, core collapse, and subsequent supernovae.  We will examine the different progenitor star masses and their impact on the resulting black hole mass and spin.  Moreover, we will discuss the observational evidence supporting black hole formation, including gravitational wave detections from merging black holes by LIGO/Virgo and the imaging of supermassive black holes at galactic centers using techniques like Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI). Finally, we will briefly touch upon open questions and future research directions, such as the role of magnetic fields in the collapse process and the formation of intermediate-mass black holes.
