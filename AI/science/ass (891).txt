This presentation explores the unique properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the lens of quantum mechanics.  CNTs, possessing exceptional mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties, owe their remarkable characteristics to their sp²-hybridized carbon atom structure and resulting electronic band structure.  We will examine how the nanotube's chirality – defined by its (n,m) indices – dictates its electronic behavior, transitioning from metallic to semiconducting depending on the specific values of n and m.  This behavior arises from the quantization of energy levels and the formation of one-dimensional π-electron bands,  a direct consequence of the cylindrical confinement of electrons.  Furthermore, we will discuss the impact of quantum confinement on the optical properties, particularly the strong dependence of absorption and emission wavelengths on diameter and chirality.  Finally, we will briefly address the challenges and opportunities associated with the accurate quantum mechanical modelling of CNTs, highlighting the importance of methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) and tight-binding approximations in understanding and predicting their behavior for applications in nanoelectronics, composites, and sensing technologies.
