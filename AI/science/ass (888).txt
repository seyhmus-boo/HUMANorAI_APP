Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them attractive for a wide range of applications.  This presentation will review the fundamental properties of CNTs, distinguishing between single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).  We will explore their remarkable tensile strength and Young's modulus, surpassing those of steel, and discuss the factors influencing these mechanical characteristics, such as chirality and diameter.  The unique electronic properties of CNTs, including their potential for metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their structure, will be detailed.  Their high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper, and its implications for thermal management applications will also be addressed.  Finally,  the presentation will briefly touch upon current challenges in CNT synthesis, purification, and scalable integration into functional devices, highlighting the ongoing research aimed at harnessing their exceptional properties for technological advancements across diverse sectors including electronics, composites, and energy storage.
