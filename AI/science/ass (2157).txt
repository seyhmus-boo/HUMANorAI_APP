Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991 through transmission electron microscopy, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-bonded graphitic structure.  These cylindrical molecules, composed of rolled-up graphene sheets, exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).  Their remarkable strength originates from the strong covalent bonds within the carbon lattice, resulting in tensile strengths exceeding that of steel.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's rolling). This tunable conductivity underpins their potential in electronics.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to superior thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  Finally, their large surface area allows for significant adsorption capabilities, finding application in gas storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT synthesis and achieving consistent properties across large-scale production, limiting widespread commercialization.
