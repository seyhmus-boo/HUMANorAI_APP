Plasma physics phenomena, while classically describable through macroscopic fluid equations, exhibit rich behaviour profoundly influenced by quantum mechanical effects, particularly at high densities and low temperatures.  Quantum mechanical considerations become crucial in understanding phenomena like electron degeneracy pressure, significant in white dwarf stars and preventing gravitational collapse.  The Pauli exclusion principle dictates the behaviour of degenerate electrons, influencing the plasma's equation of state and stability.  Furthermore, quantum effects dominate collisional processes at low temperatures, with quantum tunneling and resonant scattering affecting transport properties like conductivity and viscosity.  

The quantized nature of energy levels influences radiative processes;  bound-bound and free-bound transitions in plasmas are governed by quantum selection rules, determining spectral line intensities and broadening mechanisms.  Quantum electrodynamic effects, such as vacuum polarization and the Lamb shift, though often negligible in most laboratory plasmas, become relevant in extreme conditions such as those found in astrophysical plasmas or high-intensity laser experiments.  The study of strongly coupled plasmas necessitates incorporating quantum correlations, going beyond mean-field approximations to accurately model plasma dynamics.  In summary, a complete understanding of many plasma phenomena necessitates a quantum mechanical framework, moving beyond classical descriptions to capture their full complexity.
