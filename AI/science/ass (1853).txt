Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, is a process driven by the strong nuclear force and governed by quantum mechanical principles.  This exothermic reaction releases a significant quantity of energy, primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  The energy release arises from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the fission products is less than the mass of the original nucleus.  This mass difference is converted into energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  Fission processes are typically initiated by the absorption of a neutron, leading to an unstable intermediate nucleus that subsequently undergoes fission.  The emitted neutrons can, in turn, initiate further fission events, leading to a chain reaction.  The probability of fission occurring, and the distribution of fission products, are highly dependent on the fissile nucleus and the energy of the incident neutron.  Control of this chain reaction is crucial in nuclear reactors, where moderators and control rods are employed to regulate the neutron flux and maintain a sustained, yet safe, fission rate.  The study of fission processes remains vital for advancements in energy production, nuclear medicine, and understanding fundamental nuclear physics.
