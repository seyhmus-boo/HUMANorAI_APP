Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, lies at the heart of quantum information science.  Its potential for applications in quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation is immense. However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  This paper addresses the key hurdles encountered in generating, manipulating, and measuring entangled states, focusing on the limitations imposed by decoherence, noise, and scalability.  Specifically, we examine the difficulties associated with maintaining entanglement over extended periods and distances, the impact of environmental interactions leading to state degradation, and the challenges of scaling up entanglement generation to a number of qubits sufficient for practical applications. We will analyze existing experimental techniques, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in overcoming these challenges, and discuss promising avenues for future research, including advancements in material science, error correction codes, and novel experimental designs aimed at improving the fidelity and stability of entangled quantum systems.  Ultimately, addressing these experimental challenges is paramount for unlocking the transformative potential of quantum entanglement.
