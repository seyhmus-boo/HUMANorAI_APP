Black hole formation is a central topic in astrophysics, driven by the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  Stellar-mass black holes result from the core-collapse supernovae of stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses.  Once the core's nuclear fuel is exhausted, it collapses under its own gravity, exceeding the neutron degeneracy pressure and forming a singularity.  The surrounding material then accretes onto this singularity, forming a black hole with an event horizon delimiting its boundary.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, are believed to form through a combination of mechanisms, including the accretion of surrounding gas and dust, mergers of smaller black holes, and direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe.

Despite their enigmatic nature, the study of black hole formation has practical applications.  Gravitational wave astronomy, enabled by detectors like LIGO and Virgo, directly observes the mergers of stellar-mass black holes, providing invaluable data on their masses, spins, and formation environments.  These observations constrain stellar evolution models and offer insights into the dynamics of dense stellar populations.  Furthermore, the interplay between supermassive black holes and their host galaxies affects galactic evolution and can be used to probe cosmological parameters.  Understanding black hole formation, therefore, is not merely a theoretical pursuit but a crucial element in advancing our comprehension of the universe's structure and evolution.
