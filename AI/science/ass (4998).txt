Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in stellar evolution, primarily occurring when massive stars exhaust their nuclear fuel.  The core collapses under its own gravity, exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit and initiating a runaway process.  If the core mass surpasses the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, even neutron degeneracy pressure cannot withstand the gravitational force, leading to a singularity and the formation of a black hole.  This process, typically involving supernova explosions, is relatively well understood for single stars.

Recent developments have focused on binary systems.  Gravitational wave observations from LIGO and Virgo have provided unprecedented data on black hole mergers, revealing a population with unexpectedly high masses and spin rates, challenging some theoretical models of stellar evolution.  These observations necessitate refinement of binary stellar evolution simulations, particularly regarding mass transfer and common envelope phases, which significantly influence the final black hole masses and spins.  Furthermore, research explores intermediate-mass black hole formation, bridging the gap between stellar-mass and supermassive black holes, with mechanisms like runaway stellar collisions in dense star clusters gaining traction. These advances are pushing the boundaries of our understanding of black hole formation's complexity and diversity.
