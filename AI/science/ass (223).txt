Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of sp²-bonded carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure.  Their high aspect ratio, resembling microscopic needles, contributes to exceptionally high tensile strength – imagine a rope composed of incredibly strong, lightweight strands.  This strength is derived from the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheet that forms the nanotube's wall.

Electrical conductivity varies dramatically depending on chirality (the arrangement of hexagons), acting as either metallic conductors, akin to copper wires, or semiconductors, similar to silicon transistors. This tunable conductivity arises from the delocalized π-electrons, which behave like a flowing river in metallic CNTs but are constrained in semiconductors.  

Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable thermal conductivity, efficiently dissipating heat like a highly efficient heat pipe, due to the strong carbon-carbon bonds enabling facile phonon propagation.  Their large surface area, analogous to a highly porous sponge, allows for substantial adsorption and catalytic activity.  These diverse properties make CNTs promising materials for diverse applications, ranging from reinforced composites to advanced electronics.
