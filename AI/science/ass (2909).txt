Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes, the splitting of atomic nuclei resulting in the release of vast amounts of energy.  This process, underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry, involves bombarding heavy, fissile isotopes, primarily Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, with neutrons.  Neutron absorption initiates a chain reaction, whereby the resulting unstable nuclei fission, releasing further neutrons to continue the cycle.  

Historically, research centred on uranium-based reactors. However, recent developments showcase a shift towards exploring alternative fuel cycles.  Thorium-based reactors, for example, are gaining traction due to thorium's higher abundance and inherently safer characteristics, producing less radioactive waste.  Furthermore, advancements in accelerator-driven subcritical systems (ADS) aim to enhance efficiency and waste transmutation capabilities by using particle accelerators to control the fission reaction. These developments hold significant promise for improved nuclear energy sustainability and safety, addressing long-standing concerns associated with conventional fission technology.
