Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, was first experimentally demonstrated in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, following theoretical work by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.  This discovery, initially unexpected, overturned prevailing understanding of nuclear stability. The process involves bombarding a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with a neutron. This interaction overcomes the strong nuclear force holding the nucleus together, causing it to become unstable and subsequently fission.

This fission event releases a significant amount of energy, primarily explained by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²), as the combined mass of the daughter nuclei is slightly less than the parent nucleus.  Furthermore, the process typically releases additional neutrons, which can trigger further fission events in a chain reaction.  This self-sustaining chain reaction is the basis for nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons. The precise energy yield and the nature of the fission products vary depending on the fissile nucleus and the incident neutron's energy. Control over the chain reaction's rate is paramount in reactor technology to prevent uncontrolled energy release.
