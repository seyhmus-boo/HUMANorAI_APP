This presentation explores nuclear fission processes, highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary connections necessary for their understanding and application.  While fundamentally a physics-driven phenomenon,  a complete picture necessitates contributions from chemistry, materials science, and engineering.  We will examine the nuclear physics principles governing fission, including the role of neutron interactions, cross-sections, and energy release.  Crucially, the chemical properties of fissile materials and their interaction with reactor environments profoundly influence reactor design and safety.  The materials science aspects will be discussed, encompassing the behaviour of fuel elements under irradiation,  corrosion resistance of cladding materials, and the challenges associated with handling radioactive waste.  Furthermore, the engineering disciplines of reactor design, thermal hydraulics, and nuclear safety are essential for translating fundamental scientific understanding into practical applications.  Finally, we will briefly consider the societal implications, illustrating how ethical, economic, and political factors are inextricably linked with the advancement and implementation of fission-based technologies, underscoring the inherently interdisciplinary nature of this field.
