DNA replication, the semiconservative duplication of the genetic material, is a fundamental process ensuring the accurate transmission of hereditary information.  Early understanding stemmed from the seminal work of Chargaff (base pairing ratios) and Hershey-Chase (confirming DNA as the genetic material), providing crucial groundwork.  The elucidation of the double helix structure by Watson and Crick in 1953 finally provided a plausible mechanism for replication.  The Meselson-Stahl experiment definitively demonstrated the semiconservative nature of the process, confirming that each new DNA molecule comprises one parental and one newly synthesized strand.

Replication initiates at specific origins of replication, where the DNA double helix unwinds by helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the unwound DNA, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a starting point for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for elongating the new strand in a 5' to 3' direction.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA, and DNA ligase seals the gaps between Okazaki fragments, completing the replication process.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases.  The intricate coordination of these numerous enzymes ensures accurate and efficient duplication of the genome.
