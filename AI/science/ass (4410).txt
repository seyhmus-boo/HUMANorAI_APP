Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on catalysts in organic chemistry.  Imagine a mountain pass:  the reaction between two organic molecules is like traversing that pass. The inherent energy difference between reactants and products dictates the height of the pass – a large difference requires significant energy input.  A catalyst acts as a new, lower pass, reducing the activation energy required.  It doesn't alter the overall energy change (the height difference between the mountain's base and peak), analogous to the thermodynamic properties of the reaction remaining unchanged.

Catalysts achieve this by interacting with reactants, forming temporary intermediate complexes that possess lower activation energies than the uncatalyzed pathway.  Think of a skilled mountaineer guiding climbers – the guide (catalyst) interacts with the climbers (reactants), offering an easier, safer route to the summit (products) without themselves being permanently altered at the end of the journey.  This interaction often involves specific binding sites on the catalyst's surface, making certain reactions selectively faster.  We'll be exploring various catalytic mechanisms and their applications in subsequent lectures.
