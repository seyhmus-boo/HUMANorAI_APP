Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential across diverse technological fields.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges related to their synthesis, characterization, and manipulation. This presentation will address key experimental hurdles in CNT research.  Precise control over CNT diameter, chirality, and length during synthesis remains a significant obstacle, often resulting in heterogeneous samples compromising reproducibility and performance.  Furthermore, accurate characterization techniques capable of resolving individual CNT properties within complex bundles or composites are crucial yet often challenging.  Techniques like Raman spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy provide valuable insights but are limited by resolution and sample preparation complexities.  Finally, the inherent tendency of CNTs to aggregate necessitates sophisticated dispersion and functionalization strategies to enable efficient integration into devices, introducing further experimental complexities.  Addressing these challenges through advancements in synthesis protocols, characterization techniques, and functionalization methods is crucial for unlocking the full potential of CNTs in next-generation technologies.
