Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, have captivated scientific interest for their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.  These unique characteristics stem from their nanoscale dimensions and highly ordered atomic arrangement, resulting in materials with extraordinary strength-to-weight ratios surpassing steel, remarkable electrical conductivity rivaling copper, and exceptional thermal conductivity exceeding diamond.  This paper explores the fundamental properties of CNTs, examining their diverse structural forms, including single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), and the resulting variations in their characteristics.  We will delve into the impact of chirality and diameter on their electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour.  Furthermore, we will discuss their mechanical resilience, including tensile strength and elasticity, and their superior thermal conductivity attributed to phonon transport.  The potential applications stemming from these properties are vast, ranging from advanced composites and high-performance electronics to energy storage and biomedical devices.  This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key properties of CNTs and highlight their transformative potential across various technological domains.
