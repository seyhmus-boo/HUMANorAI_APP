Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the balance between the strong nuclear force, binding nucleons together, and the Coulomb repulsion between protons.  In heavy nuclei, the Coulomb repulsion becomes increasingly dominant, overcoming the strong force at longer ranges.  Quantum tunneling plays a crucial role; the probability of a nucleus overcoming the potential energy barrier separating it from a fissioned state is non-zero, even if its energy is less than the barrier height. This tunneling probability is determined by the shape of the potential energy surface, which is itself a complex quantum mechanical calculation involving the interaction of many nucleons.  The wave function of the nucleus, a solution to the many-body Schr√∂dinger equation, describes the probability of finding the nucleons in various configurations.  Deformation of the nucleus, leading to a dumbbell shape and ultimately scission, corresponds to a specific evolution of this wave function.  Furthermore, the subsequent emission of neutrons, a characteristic feature of fission, is also a quantum mechanical phenomenon, with neutron emission probabilities dictated by the energy levels and wave functions of the daughter nuclei and the emitted neutrons.  Understanding fission from a quantum perspective thus necessitates sophisticated computational techniques, such as time-dependent density functional theory, to approximate the solutions of this complex many-body problem.
