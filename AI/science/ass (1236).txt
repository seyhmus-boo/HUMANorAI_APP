Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, possess a unique combination of properties that stem from their exceptional structure: cylindrical sheets of sp²-bonded carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, with tensile strengths exceeding that of steel, is attributed to the strong covalent bonds within the graphitic network. This high strength is coupled with remarkable flexibility and elasticity, allowing for significant bending and deformation without failure.  Electrically, CNTs can exhibit either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality – the angle of the hexagonal lattice's orientation around the tube axis.  Metallic nanotubes demonstrate excellent electrical conductivity, comparable to copper, while semiconducting nanotubes show potential for applications in nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptionally high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  This remarkable combination of mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, coupled with their high aspect ratio (length-to-diameter), positions carbon nanotubes as a versatile material for diverse applications ranging from advanced composites to next-generation electronics and energy storage devices.  Ongoing research continues to explore and refine these properties for optimal exploitation in various technological domains.
