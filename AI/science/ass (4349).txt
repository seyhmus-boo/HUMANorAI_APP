Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Its theoretical underpinnings were laid by the work of Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in 1939, who correctly interpreted the experimental observations of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann concerning the bombardment of uranium with neutrons.  This interpretation, explaining the observed release of significant energy and lighter elements, marked a paradigm shift in our understanding of nuclear processes.  Subsequent research confirmed that the fission of uranium-235, initiated by the absorption of a neutron, releases not only energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments but also additional neutrons, thus paving the way for chain reactions.  This crucial feature, whereby each fission event triggers further fissions, underpins the operation of nuclear reactors and weapons.  The immense energy release arises from the mass defect, a consequence of the strong nuclear force, with a small amount of mass converted into a large quantity of energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  The controlled and uncontrolled exploitation of this phenomenon have profoundly impacted the 20th and 21st centuries, shaping both technological advancement and geopolitical realities.
