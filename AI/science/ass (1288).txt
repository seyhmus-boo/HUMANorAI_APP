Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  These systems, regardless of spatial separation, exhibit a unified quantum state, such that measurement of one instantaneously influences the state of the others, even exceeding the limitations imposed by the speed of light. This interconnectedness transcends classical intuition, as the entangled particles cannot be described by independent wavefunctions.  Bell's theorem rigorously demonstrates the incompatibility of local realism with quantum mechanics, experimentally confirmed through violations of Bell inequalities.  Entanglement arises from the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of the Hilbert space describing composite systems.  The degree of entanglement is quantified using measures such as concurrence or entanglement entropy.  Applications of entanglement range from quantum computing and quantum cryptography, exploiting its unique properties for enhanced computational power and secure communication, to fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and explorations of the foundations of physics.  Despite extensive research, the precise ontological interpretation of entanglement remains a subject of ongoing debate.
