Black hole formation represents a pivotal process in astrophysics, shaping galactic evolution and testing the limits of general relativity. This presentation will explore the diverse mechanisms leading to black hole birth, focusing on stellar-mass black holes resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars and supermassive black holes residing at galactic centers, whose formation remains an area of active research.  We will examine the crucial role of stellar metallicity, rotation, and binary interactions in determining the fate of massive stars, highlighting the different evolutionary pathways leading to black hole formation.  Further, the presentation will discuss current theoretical models and observational constraints, such as gravitational wave detections from merging black holes and electromagnetic counterparts.  Beyond fundamental astrophysical understanding, practical applications of this research extend to gravitational wave astronomy, which provides unique insights into the properties and populations of black holes.  Precise modeling of black hole formation is vital for interpreting gravitational wave data and extracting cosmological information about the universe's expansion history and the distribution of matter.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon ongoing efforts to refine our theoretical understanding and future observational prospects.
