This abstract surveys recent advancements in understanding plasma physics phenomena through a quantum mechanical lens.  Classical plasma physics often proves insufficient to describe systems exhibiting strong quantum effects, particularly at high densities or low temperatures.  We focus on several key areas:  quantum effects on collective modes, including the modification of plasma oscillations and Landau damping due to quantum degeneracy and exchange interactions.  The role of quantum tunneling in collisional processes and transport coefficients is examined, highlighting deviations from classical Boltzmann-like behavior.  Furthermore, the emergence of macroscopic quantum phenomena in plasmas, such as superfluidity and Bose-Einstein condensation, are discussed in relation to specific experimental realizations, including ultracold neutral plasmas and strongly coupled plasmas.  We also touch upon the crucial role of quantum electrodynamic effects, such as vacuum polarization and radiative corrections, in high-energy density plasmas relevant to astrophysical settings and inertial confinement fusion.  Future research directions, including the development of improved theoretical models and advanced experimental techniques to probe quantum plasma behavior, are briefly outlined.
