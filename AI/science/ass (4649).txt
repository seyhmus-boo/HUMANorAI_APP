Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns catalysts in organic chemistry.  Think of a catalyst as a matchmaker in a chemical reaction.  It facilitates the union of reactants, lowering the energy barrier – the activation energy – required for the reaction to proceed.  Imagine two shy molecules, reluctant to interact.  The catalyst, our matchmaker, introduces them in a conducive environment, perhaps bringing them closer together or subtly altering their shapes, thereby allowing them to react readily.

Crucially, the catalyst itself remains unchanged at the end of the reaction.  It's like a diligent matchmaker who facilitates many unions without being personally involved in the resulting relationships.  This allows for significantly enhanced reaction rates and yields, even facilitating reactions that would otherwise be impractically slow or simply impossible under normal conditions.  Catalysts are indispensable in many organic syntheses, enabling the creation of complex molecules with high efficiency, shaping the landscape of modern chemical industry and research.  We will now examine some specific examples of catalytic mechanisms.
