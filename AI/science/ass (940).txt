Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient platform for genome editing.  This review explores the transformative impact of CRISPR technology across diverse biological disciplines.  Initially identified as a bacterial adaptive immune system, CRISPR-Cas, particularly the Cas9 enzyme, has been harnessed for targeted gene modification, including gene knockouts, knockins, and base editing. Its relative simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and versatility compared to previous gene editing tools have significantly broadened its application. This paper examines the diverse methodologies employed in CRISPR-mediated gene editing, highlighting advancements in delivery systems, targeting strategies, and the development of novel Cas variants with improved specificity and functionality. Furthermore, we will discuss the significant ethical considerations surrounding CRISPR's application, particularly in human gene therapy, germline editing, and potential off-target effects.  Finally, we will explore future directions in CRISPR research, including the development of more sophisticated tools for gene regulation and the potential for tackling complex genetic diseases.  This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of CRISPR technology and its implications for the future of genetic engineering.
