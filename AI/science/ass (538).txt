Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation transcends classical physics; measuring the property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the measurable properties of its entangled partner(s), even at distances exceeding light-travel time.  This non-local correlation arises from the superposition principle and the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, where particles exist in a superposition of states until measured.  The entangled particles are described by a single, composite wave function, collapsing upon measurement into a definite state for all constituent particles. This seemingly paradoxical behavior has profound implications for quantum computing, cryptography, and our fundamental understanding of reality.  Experimental verification of entanglement, including Bell inequality violations, has solidified its existence as a genuine quantum phenomenon, fueling ongoing research into its potential for technological advancements and further theoretical exploration.
