Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, exhibit a unique combination of properties stemming from their cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.  These properties have generated significant interest for diverse applications.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, with tensile strength exceeding that of steel, is attributed to the strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms and their highly ordered structure.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable electrical conductivity, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality (the angle of the hexagonal lattice relative to the nanotube axis).  This tunable conductivity makes them attractive for nanoelectronics.  Their high aspect ratio (length-to-diameter) results in a large surface area, leading to significant applications in adsorption and catalysis.  Finally, CNTs demonstrate exceptional thermal conductivity, surpassing that of many metals, facilitating their use in thermal management applications.  The diverse and remarkable properties of CNTs, coupled with ongoing research into controlled synthesis and functionalization, continue to drive advancements across numerous scientific and engineering disciplines.
