Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, have garnered significant attention for diverse technological applications.  This presentation delves into the quantum mechanical underpinnings of these remarkable properties.  We will explore the electronic structure of CNTs, elucidating the crucial role of π-electron delocalization within the sp²-hybridized carbon network.  The impact of nanotube chirality and diameter on their band structure will be discussed, differentiating between metallic and semiconducting behaviours arising from distinct quantum confinement effects.  Further, we will analyze the influence of quantum mechanical interactions on the mechanical strength and flexibility of CNTs, highlighting the strong covalent bonds and their contribution to high tensile strength.  Finally,  we will briefly touch upon the implications of quantum phenomena, such as electron-phonon coupling, on the thermal conductivity and ballistic transport properties. This presentation aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive overview of the quantum mechanics governing the unique characteristics of carbon nanotubes, highlighting their potential for future technological advancements.
