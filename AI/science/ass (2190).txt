Catalysts play a pivotal role in accelerating and controlling organic reactions, enabling transformations otherwise inaccessible under practical conditions.  This lecture explores the diverse applications of catalysts across various organic reaction classes, focusing on their mechanisms of action and impact on selectivity and yield.  We examine homogeneous catalysts, such as transition metal complexes, which interact intimately with the reactants, often through coordination chemistry, enabling precise control over stereochemistry and regioselectivity.  Heterogeneous catalysts, including zeolites and metal nanoparticles, provide advantages such as ease of separation and reusability, although their active sites may exhibit less defined reactivity.  The lecture further details the principles of catalyst design, including ligand modification in homogeneous catalysis and support engineering in heterogeneous systems, to achieve enhanced activity and stability.  Finally, we briefly discuss emerging areas such as biocatalysis and photocatalysis, highlighting their potential for sustainable and environmentally benign organic synthesis.
