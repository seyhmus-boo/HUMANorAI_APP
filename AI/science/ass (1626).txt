Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the experimental challenges inherent in verifying black hole formation.  Theoretically, stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.  However, directly observing this process is presently impossible.  The immense gravitational forces involved preclude the escape of electromagnetic radiation during the final stages of collapse, rendering the event itself effectively invisible.

Our observational evidence is instead indirect.  We infer black hole existence through their gravitational effects on surrounding matter, manifested as accretion disks emitting intense X-rays, or via gravitational lensing.  However, these observations don't directly confirm the formation mechanism.  Furthermore, accurately modelling the dynamics of collapsing stellar cores requires incredibly complex simulations, hampered by limitations in computational power and incomplete understanding of the equation of state at extreme densities and pressures.  Future gravitational wave astronomy, while promising, currently lacks the resolution to definitively pinpoint the precise moment of black hole formation.  Overcoming these challenges remains a key objective in modern astrophysics.
