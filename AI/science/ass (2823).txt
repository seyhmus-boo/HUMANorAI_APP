Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique sp² hybridized carbon structure.  Their cylindrical morphology, consisting of rolled-up graphene sheets, results in extraordinarily high tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel.  This exceptional mechanical resilience is coupled with remarkable electrical conductivity, varying from metallic to semiconducting behaviour depending on chirality – the angle and orientation of the graphene sheet's rolling.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  Their large surface area contributes to significant adsorption capabilities, making them suitable for gas storage and catalysis.

These properties translate into diverse applications.  Their strength finds use in reinforcing composites for aerospace and automotive industries.  Their electrical conductivity is exploited in electronics, potentially enabling smaller and faster transistors.  High thermal conductivity applications include heat sinks and thermal interface materials.  Finally, their adsorption properties are being explored in areas such as water purification and energy storage, specifically in advanced battery technologies and supercapacitors.  However, challenges remain in scalable and cost-effective production, and in achieving consistent properties across large batches.
