DNA replication, the fundamental process by which genetic information is duplicated, remains a cornerstone of molecular biology.  While the semi-conservative mechanism elucidated by Meselson and Stahl forms the bedrock of our understanding, recent advancements have significantly refined our appreciation of its complexity and regulation.  This paper reviews current understanding of DNA replication, focusing on emerging insights into the intricate interplay of proteins involved in the replication fork.  Significant progress has been made in elucidating the roles of accessory proteins, such as the various helicases and clamp loaders, in ensuring replication fidelity and processivity, particularly in the context of challenging genomic landscapes.  Furthermore, recent structural biology studies employing cryo-electron microscopy have provided unprecedented high-resolution views of replication complexes, illuminating the dynamic nature of these molecular machines.  Finally, we will explore the burgeoning field of replication stress responses and their implications for genomic stability and disease, including the roles of newly identified pathways in mitigating replication fork collapse and facilitating recovery.  This review will integrate these advancements to present a contemporary perspective on DNA replication, highlighting remaining challenges and future research directions.
