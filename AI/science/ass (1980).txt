Black hole formation represents a crucial intersection of astrophysics, nuclear physics, and general relativity.  This abstract summarizes current understanding of this process, highlighting key interdisciplinary links. Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit, a limit derived from principles of stellar structure and nuclear physics governing the balance between radiation pressure and gravity. The final stages of collapse involve complex hydrodynamic simulations incorporating strong-field general relativity, necessitating sophisticated numerical techniques bridging computational astrophysics and theoretical physics. Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, remain less understood, with proposed formation mechanisms ranging from the direct collapse of massive gas clouds—a scenario requiring detailed modeling of gas dynamics and radiative transfer—to the merger and accretion of stellar-mass black holes, a process simulated using N-body methods in computational astrophysics and informed by observational data from gravitational wave astronomy.  Multi-messenger astronomy, combining gravitational wave signals with electromagnetic observations, provides critical observational constraints on the dynamics and astrophysical environments surrounding black hole formation events, furthering our understanding of these enigmatic objects and the interplay between different branches of physics.  Future research will benefit from continued advances in both theoretical modeling and observational capabilities.
