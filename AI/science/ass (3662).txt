Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on CRISPR-Cas systems, revolutionary tools in genetic engineering.  CRISPR, or Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats, leverages naturally occurring bacterial defense mechanisms to precisely edit DNA.  This involves guiding a Cas enzyme, most commonly Cas9, to a target DNA sequence via a short RNA molecule, allowing for targeted cleavage and subsequent modification.  

Recent developments significantly enhance CRISPR's precision and capabilities. Base editors, for example, enable single-base substitutions without causing double-stranded breaks, minimizing off-target effects.  Prime editing expands this further, allowing for all types of point mutations, insertions, and deletions with improved precision.  Furthermore, research is advancing the delivery methods, moving beyond viral vectors towards safer and more efficient non-viral approaches, paving the way for broader therapeutic applications.  These advancements are pushing the boundaries of gene therapy, disease modelling, and agricultural biotechnology, promising a future of tailored genetic interventions.
