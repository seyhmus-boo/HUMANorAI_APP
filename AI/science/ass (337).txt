Black hole formation is a pivotal process in astrophysics, ultimately governed by the interplay of gravity and stellar evolution.  Massive stars, exceeding approximately eight solar masses, exhaust their nuclear fuel, culminating in a core collapse supernova.  The immense gravitational pressure overcomes degeneracy pressure, causing the core to implode catastrophically. If the remnant core's mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (approximately three solar masses),  further collapse ensues, resulting in a singularity – a point of infinite density –  and the formation of a black hole. This process is theoretically well-understood, though precise modeling remains challenging due to the complexities of supernova dynamics and the extreme conditions near the event horizon.  Beyond stellar-mass black holes, supermassive black holes, millions or even billions of times the mass of the Sun, reside at the centers of most galaxies.  Their formation mechanisms are less certain, involving potential seed black holes growing through accretion or mergers.  Understanding black hole formation has practical applications in astrophysical modeling, contributing to improved simulations of galactic evolution, gravitational wave predictions (via mergers), and the calibration of cosmological models.  Furthermore, the study of accretion disks around black holes informs our understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena, including active galactic nuclei and X-ray binaries.
