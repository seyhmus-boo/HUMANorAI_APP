Black hole formation represents a pivotal area of astrophysical research, with significant implications for our understanding of stellar evolution and the cosmos. This presentation will explore the diverse mechanisms leading to black hole creation, focusing on the collapse of massive stars and the potential role of mergers of compact objects. We will examine the theoretical frameworks used to model these processes, including numerical simulations incorporating general relativity and sophisticated stellar evolution codes.  Particular emphasis will be given to the observational signatures used to identify black hole candidates, such as gravitational waves detected by LIGO/Virgo and X-ray emissions from accretion disks.

Furthermore, we will discuss the practical applications arising from this research.  Accurate black hole formation models are crucial for refining cosmological simulations, providing insights into galaxy evolution and large-scale structure formation. Understanding the properties of black holes aids in the interpretation of gravitational wave data, enabling the determination of black hole masses and spins, and potentially revealing information about their progenitor systems. The ability to accurately predict black hole formation rates also has implications for the detection and characterization of these enigmatic objects through ongoing and future observational programs, furthering our knowledge of extreme gravity and the universe's evolutionary pathways.
