This presentation provides a concise overview of chemical bonding and molecular structure through the lens of quantum mechanics.  We will explore how the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Schr√∂dinger equation and its solutions, underpin our understanding of chemical interactions.  The discussion will encompass the formation of both covalent and ionic bonds, elucidating the role of atomic orbitals in the construction of molecular orbitals via linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approximation.  Emphasis will be placed on the importance of orbital overlap and the resulting electron density distribution in determining bond strength and geometry.  Furthermore, we will touch upon the application of molecular orbital theory to predict molecular properties, such as bond order, magnetism, and spectroscopic characteristics.  This presentation aims to bridge the gap between abstract quantum mechanical concepts and their tangible consequences in the realm of chemical bonding and structure, illustrating the power of quantum mechanics in rationalizing observed molecular behavior and predicting novel chemical interactions. Finally, we will briefly discuss limitations of the LCAO-MO approach and introduce advanced techniques, such as density functional theory (DFT), for more accurate computations.
