DNA replication, the process of duplicating a cell's genome, is essential for cell proliferation and inheritance.  This highly conserved process involves a complex interplay of enzymes and proteins orchestrated to ensure high fidelity and efficiency.  Initiation begins at specific origins of replication, where the DNA double helix is unwound by helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the unwound DNA, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH terminus for DNA polymerase III to initiate leading-strand synthesis.  Lagging-strand synthesis occurs discontinuously in Okazaki fragments, requiring repeated primer synthesis and removal by RNase H and DNA polymerase I.  DNA ligase then seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, completing the lagging strand.  The remarkable accuracy of DNA replication is maintained through proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and mismatch repair mechanisms.  Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, present a unique challenge due to the inability of DNA polymerases to replicate the 5' end; telomerase extends these sequences in germline cells.  Disruptions in DNA replication fidelity contribute to genomic instability and are implicated in various diseases, including cancer.  Ongoing research continues to elucidate the intricate mechanisms and regulatory pathways governing this fundamental biological process.
