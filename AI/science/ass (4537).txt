Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon first predicted by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in 1935 as a paradox highlighting the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical physics, exhibiting non-local correlations where the measurement outcome on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of spatial separation.  The EPR paradox challenged the notion of locality, suggesting the possibility of faster-than-light communication.  Bell's theorem, formulated in the 1960s, provided a testable framework to distinguish quantum mechanics from local hidden-variable theories, experimentally confirmed through violations of Bell inequalities.  Entanglement has since evolved from a conceptual curiosity to a cornerstone of quantum information science.  It underpins quantum computing, where entangled qubits enable powerful computational algorithms, and quantum cryptography, exploiting entanglement for secure communication.  Current research focuses on generating and manipulating entanglement in diverse systems, including photons, ions, and superconducting circuits, to improve the scalability and robustness of quantum technologies.  The continuing exploration of entanglement promises transformative advancements in diverse fields.
