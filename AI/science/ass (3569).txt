Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a subject of ongoing investigation. This review summarizes key aspects of entanglement, highlighting its counterintuitive nature and its profound implications for quantum information science.  The concept of Bell inequalities, used to experimentally test the predictions of quantum mechanics against local realism, is discussed, along with experimental verification demonstrating the violation of these inequalities.  Further, the review explores various methods for generating entangled states, including spontaneous parametric down-conversion and trapped ion techniques.  Applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation are briefly examined, emphasizing the potential of entangled states to enable secure communication and enhanced computational capabilities.  Despite significant advancements, challenges persist in scaling up entanglement-based technologies, particularly concerning the fragility of entangled states to decoherence.  Future research directions are briefly outlined, focusing on developing robust entanglement generation and manipulation techniques for practical applications.
