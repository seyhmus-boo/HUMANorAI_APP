Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the mechanisms of photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.  Think of photosynthesis as a sophisticated factory with two main assembly lines: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (the Calvin cycle).

The light-dependent reactions are akin to the factory's power generation.  Chlorophyll, the primary pigment, acts as a solar panel, capturing light energy. This energy is then used to split water molecules (photolysis), analogous to a hydroelectric dam generating power from water flow.  The resulting electrons are passed along an electron transport chain, like a conveyor belt, generating ATP and NADPH – the factory's energy currency.

The light-independent reactions, or the Calvin cycle, are the factory's production line.  Using the ATP and NADPH generated previously, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere – our raw material – is "fixed" into glucose, a simple sugar, through a series of enzymatic reactions. This glucose represents the factory's final product, storing the captured solar energy in a usable chemical form.  Thus, sunlight is converted into the chemical energy that fuels the biosphere.
