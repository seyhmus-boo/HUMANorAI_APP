Nuclear fission, the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal advancement in scientific understanding and technological application.  Its discovery, stemming from the pioneering work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and the subsequent theoretical elucidation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, marked a paradigm shift in physics.  Initially interpreted as a surprising anomaly in nuclear reactions, the observation of barium isotopes following neutron bombardment of uranium revealed the underlying fission mechanism, unleashing an unprecedented potential for energy generation and, tragically, for devastating weaponry.  The subsequent Manhattan Project during World War II dramatically demonstrated both the immense destructive power and the intricate scientific challenges associated with harnessing this process.  Since then, research into nuclear fission has branched into various avenues, including the development of nuclear power reactors for electricity generation, the study of different fissile materials and their respective characteristics, and ongoing efforts towards improving reactor safety and waste management. This paper will explore the fundamental principles governing nuclear fission processes, examining the underlying physics, different fission pathways, and the associated energy yields, ultimately considering the ongoing relevance and future prospects of this transformative scientific discovery.
