Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties driving their exploration across diverse scientific disciplines.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, stemming from strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds, is exploited in materials science for reinforcing composites and developing high-strength fibers.  Their unique electrical properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, are pivotal in electronics, enabling applications in transistors and flexible circuitry.  Furthermore, their high surface area contributes to their exceptional adsorption capabilities, making them attractive in environmental science for remediation and energy storage, particularly in supercapacitors and batteries.  

The interdisciplinary nature of CNT research is evident in their biomedical applications.  Their biocompatibility (depending on functionalization) allows for drug delivery systems and biosensors, merging materials science and biology.  Moreover, their optical properties, including strong near-infrared absorbance, find use in photothermal therapy, demonstrating the synergy between materials science, physics, and medicine.  Ongoing research continues to uncover new facets of CNT properties, broadening their impact across diverse fields and emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to fully harness their potential.
