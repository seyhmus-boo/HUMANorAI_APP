Black hole formation remains a central and actively debated topic in astrophysics, bridging the realms of stellar evolution, galactic dynamics, and fundamental physics.  This paper reviews the current understanding of black hole genesis, focusing on the dominant formation channels: the gravitational collapse of massive stars and the hierarchical merging of stellar-mass black holes in dense stellar environments.  We explore the diverse astrophysical contexts underpinning these processes, including the role of stellar metallicity, binary interactions, and supernova explosions in shaping the resulting black hole mass function and spin distribution.  Furthermore, we critically assess the limitations of current theoretical models and observational techniques, particularly in constraining the formation pathways of supermassive black holes residing at galactic centres.  Recent advances in gravitational wave astronomy and multi-wavelength observations are highlighted, showcasing their transformative impact on refining our understanding of black hole demographics and their evolutionary history.  This review synthesizes existing knowledge and outlines key open questions demanding further investigation, paving the way for a more complete picture of black hole formation across cosmic time.
