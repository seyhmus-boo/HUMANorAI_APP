Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, is a cornerstone of life on Earth and a subject of intense interdisciplinary research.  The process is broadly divided into light-dependent and light-independent reactions.  Light-dependent reactions, occurring in the thylakoid membranes, involve photosystems I and II, utilizing chlorophyll and accessory pigments.  Excitation of these pigments initiates an electron transport chain, generating ATP and NADPH via chemiosmosis â€“ a concept linking biology to physical chemistry through proton gradients.  This process is further influenced by environmental factors like light intensity and wavelength, analyzed through physics and ecology.

The light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, occur in the stroma.  This cyclical pathway, a key concept in biochemistry, fixes atmospheric CO2 into organic molecules like glucose.  Enzyme kinetics, a branch of chemistry, governs the rate-limiting steps, and the efficiency is influenced by environmental factors, such as temperature and water availability, investigated in environmental science and climatology.  Furthermore, genomic approaches provide insights into the genetic regulation and evolution of photosynthetic machinery, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of photosynthesis research impacting our understanding of climate change, biofuel production, and crop improvement.
