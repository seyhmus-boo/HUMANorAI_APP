Black hole formation is a consequence of extreme gravitational collapse.  Imagine a massive star, a celestial body far exceeding our Sun's mass, nearing the end of its lifespan.  Its nuclear fusion furnace, generating outward pressure, eventually falters.  This is akin to a giant balloon losing air – the internal pressure supporting its structure diminishes.  Without this counteracting force, the star's immense self-gravity takes over, a relentless inward pull analogous to an ever-tightening fist.

This gravitational collapse compresses the star's core to an incredibly dense singularity, a point of infinite density.  The star's remaining mass is then crushed into a region of spacetime so warped that not even light can escape its gravitational grip, forming the event horizon – the point of no return, like a whirlpool whose current is too strong to resist.  Depending on the initial stellar mass and its rotation, different types of black holes form, including stellar-mass black holes (from collapsing stars) and supermassive black holes (likely formed through the merger of smaller black holes and accretion of surrounding matter).  The process ultimately transforms a luminous giant into a region of profound darkness, a singularity hidden behind the event horizon.
