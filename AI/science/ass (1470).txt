Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two smaller nuclei.  Imagine a meticulously balanced ball perched atop a hill representing a large, unstable nucleus.  A small nudge, analogous to the absorption of a neutron, disrupts this equilibrium.  The ball, now destabilized, rolls down the hill, releasing potential energy as kinetic energy. This descent represents the fission process itself, where the nucleus violently fragments.

The "hill" in this analogy represents the strong nuclear force holding the nucleus together, initially counterbalanced by the electrostatic repulsion between protons. The neutron absorption disrupts this balance, overwhelming the strong force and causing the nucleus to rapidly fission.  The resulting smaller nuclei, akin to the ball reaching the bottom of the hill, possess considerable kinetic energy, manifesting as heat and the emission of further neutrons.  These newly released neutrons, similar to the initial nudge, can then trigger further fission events in nearby nuclei, initiating a chain reaction â€“ a cascading avalanche of balls rolling down the hill.  This chain reaction is the basis of nuclear power generation and weaponry.
