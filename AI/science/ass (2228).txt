Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, sharing the same fate regardless of spatial separation.  This interconnectedness transcends classical physics; measuring the property of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the other, irrespective of the distance separating them.  This correlation arises from the particles' shared quantum state, a superposition before measurement collapses it into a definite state for both.  Einstein famously referred to this as "spooky action at a distance."

The underlying principle is the violation of Bell's inequalities, experimentally confirmed, demonstrating that quantum mechanics cannot be fully explained by local realism.  Practical applications are emerging, albeit still largely in early stages. Quantum computing leverages entanglement for increased processing power, enabling the exploration of complex systems currently intractable for classical computers.  Quantum cryptography utilizes entanglement to create secure communication channels, as any eavesdropping attempt would inevitably disturb the entangled state.  Furthermore, advancements in quantum metrology and sensing exploit entangled states for enhanced precision in measurements.  Despite significant challenges, the potential of entanglement to revolutionize information technology and precision measurement remains significant.
