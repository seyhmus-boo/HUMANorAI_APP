DNA replication is the semiconservative process by which a cell duplicates its genome prior to cell division.  Imagine DNA as a zipper, with each side representing a single-stranded polynucleotide chain composed of nucleotides.  The process begins with the enzyme helicase, which acts like a zipper opener, unwinding the double helix and separating the two strands.  These separated strands then serve as templates.

Next, another enzyme, DNA polymerase, acts like a meticulous scribe, adding complementary nucleotides to each template strand.  This adheres to the base-pairing rules (A with T, and G with C), ensuring faithful replication.  This is akin to copying a text, with each strand dictating the sequence of the newly synthesized strand.  The process proceeds bidirectionally from multiple origins of replication, like multiple zipper openers working along the length of the zipper simultaneously.

Finally, the newly synthesized strands wind around their respective templates, forming two identical DNA molecules, each consisting of one parental (original) and one daughter (newly synthesized) strand.  This semi-conservative nature ensures genetic continuity and accuracy, minimizing errors in the transmission of genetic information across generations.
