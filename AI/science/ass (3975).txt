Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating phenomenon of quantum entanglement.  From a quantum mechanical perspective, entanglement describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  These systems, even when spatially separated, exist in a combined quantum state that cannot be factored into individual states.  This means the properties of one entangled particle are inextricably linked to those of its partner, regardless of distance.

Mathematically, this is represented by a composite wavefunction that is not a simple product of individual wavefunctions.  A measurement performed on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of the separation.  This seemingly instantaneous correlation does *not* violate special relativity, as no information is transmitted faster than light; the correlation exists prior to measurement, and the outcome of a measurement on one particle is only probabilistically determined by the entangled state.  Einstein famously referred to this as "spooky action at a distance," highlighting the counter-intuitive nature of this fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics.  The implications of entanglement are profound, extending to quantum computing and cryptography.
