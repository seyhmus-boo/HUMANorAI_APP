Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient tool for genome editing.  However, despite its widespread adoption and remarkable success in various model organisms, the application of CRISPR technology remains fraught with experimental challenges. This research paper focuses on these critical limitations, exploring the complexities that hinder the broader and more effective utilization of CRISPR-Cas systems.  We will examine the challenges associated with off-target effects, a major concern stemming from the potential for unintended genomic modifications at sites other than the intended target locus.  Furthermore, the delivery of CRISPR-Cas components to target cells, particularly in vivo, presents significant hurdles varying across different organisms and tissue types.  We will also address the complexities associated with efficient gene editing in various cell types, including the challenges of accessing and modifying non-dividing cells and overcoming cellular repair mechanisms that can hinder successful gene alteration. Finally, the paper will discuss the ongoing efforts to address these challenges, highlighting advancements in improving targeting specificity, optimizing delivery methods, and developing novel strategies for enhancing editing efficiency.  Ultimately, understanding and overcoming these limitations is crucial for realizing the full therapeutic and research potential of CRISPR technology.
