This presentation provides a concise overview of chemical bonding and molecular structure through the lens of quantum mechanics.  We will explore how the fundamental principles of quantum theory, specifically the Schr√∂dinger equation and its approximate solutions, underpin our understanding of molecular geometry and stability.  The presentation will delve into the contrasting concepts of valence bond theory (VBT) and molecular orbital theory (MOT), highlighting their strengths and limitations in predicting molecular properties.  VBT's focus on localized electron pairs and hybridization will be contrasted with MOT's description of delocalized molecular orbitals and the resulting bonding and antibonding interactions.  We will examine how these theoretical frameworks explain diverse bonding phenomena, including sigma and pi bonds, resonance structures, and the effects of electron correlation.  Furthermore, the presentation will touch upon advanced computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT), used to predict and analyze molecular structures and properties with increased accuracy.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the application of these principles to the prediction of reactivity and spectroscopic properties, emphasizing the crucial role of quantum mechanics in modern chemistry.
