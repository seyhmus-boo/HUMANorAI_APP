DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is essential for cell proliferation and heredity.  This semiconservative mechanism ensures accurate transmission of genetic information to daughter cells.  Initiation involves the unwinding of the double helix at specific origins of replication by helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the unwound DNA, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for synthesizing the new DNA strand in a 5' to 3' direction.  Leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously, while lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously, generating Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, resulting in two complete double-stranded DNA molecules.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and various repair mechanisms correcting errors introduced during replication.  Disruptions to this tightly regulated process can lead to mutations and genomic instability, contributing to disease pathogenesis.
