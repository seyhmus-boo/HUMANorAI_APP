Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional properties, exhibit remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  Their cylindrical structure, comprised of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices, leads to exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding that of steel.  Electrical conductivity varies significantly depending on chirality; armchair CNTs are metallic, while zigzag and chiral CNTs can be semiconducting, offering potential for nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.

Recent developments focus on improving CNT synthesis and processing for diverse applications.  Advances in catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD) yield higher purity and yield of CNTs with controlled diameter and chirality.  Furthermore, research on functionalization techniques, including covalent and non-covalent modifications, enhances CNT dispersibility and facilitates integration into composite materials.  Significant progress has also been made in understanding and controlling CNT self-assembly, leading to the fabrication of complex macroscopic structures.  These advancements pave the way for the widespread application of CNTs in high-strength composites, flexible electronics, advanced sensors, and energy storage devices.
