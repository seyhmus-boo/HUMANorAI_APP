Plasma physics phenomena, while often treated classically, exhibit rich quantum mechanical effects at various scales.  At the microscopic level, quantum mechanical interactions govern the fundamental processes determining plasma properties.  The Pauli exclusion principle dictates the behaviour of degenerate plasmas, significantly impacting their thermodynamic properties and stability, particularly in dense astrophysical environments like white dwarf stars.  Quantum effects also influence the collisional dynamics within plasmas, altering scattering cross-sections and transport coefficients from their classical counterparts, especially at low temperatures and high densities.  Furthermore, quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects, although often negligible in most laboratory plasmas, become crucial in high-intensity laser-plasma interactions, leading to phenomena like photon-photon scattering and pair production.  The quantum nature of electromagnetic fields is also integral to understanding processes such as spontaneous emission and stimulated emission in plasmas, influencing the radiative properties and spectral characteristics. Finally, the quantization of energy levels in confined plasmas, such as in quantum dots or semiconductor plasmas, leads to unique collective excitations and transport behaviours not captured by classical descriptions.  Thus, a complete understanding of plasma phenomena requires incorporating these quantum mechanical considerations, particularly in extreme conditions.
