Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy.  Imagine a meticulously balanced stack of incredibly dense building blocks representing the nucleus.  A single neutron, acting like a carefully placed destabilizing force, strikes this stack. This impact disrupts the delicate balance, causing the stack to dramatically collapse.  The "collapse" is analogous to the fission event, where the large nucleus fragments into two or more smaller nuclei, the fission fragments.  

This fragmentation doesn't simply break the stack; it also releases some of the binding energy that held the blocks (nucleons) together. This released energy, analogous to the potential energy stored in a compressed spring, manifests as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and released neutrons.  These neutrons, acting as triggers, can then initiate a chain reaction, similar to a domino effect, where each fission event produces more neutrons causing further fissions, leading to a rapid release of energy.  Controlling this chain reaction is crucial in nuclear reactors, achieved through neutron absorption materials that act like buffers, slowing down the "domino effect" to a manageable rate.  Uncontrolled chain reactions, as seen in nuclear weapons, result in an explosive release of energy.
