DNA replication, the fundamental process ensuring genetic inheritance, has captivated scientists since the elucidation of DNA's double helix structure.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of this crucial biological process, tracing its historical understanding from the initial postulation of semi-conservative replication by Watson and Crick to current sophisticated models.  We will discuss the key enzymes involved, including DNA polymerases, helicases, and primases, highlighting their roles in unwinding the parental DNA, synthesizing the leading and lagging strands, and ensuring high fidelity replication.  The challenges presented by the inherent structural features of DNA, such as replication origins and the problem of replicating telomeres, will be addressed.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly touch upon the intricate regulatory mechanisms governing the timing and accuracy of replication, including checkpoints and repair pathways that maintain genomic stability.  Finally, we will briefly explore the implications of replication errors and their contribution to mutagenesis and disease, emphasizing the continued importance of research in this field for understanding fundamental biology and combating human disease.
