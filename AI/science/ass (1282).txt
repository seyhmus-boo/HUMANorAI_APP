Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical physics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, irrespective of spatial separation.  This non-classical correlation manifests as an instantaneous correlation of measurement outcomes, even when the entangled particles are light-years apart, a characteristic famously highlighted by Einstein's "spooky action at a distance."  This directly challenges the principle of locality inherent in classical physics.

The interdisciplinary implications of entanglement are significant.  In quantum computing, entanglement forms the basis for powerful algorithms exceeding classical computational capabilities, promising breakthroughs in cryptography and materials science.  In quantum information science, entangled particles serve as qubits, enabling enhanced information storage and processing.  Furthermore, entanglement finds application in quantum metrology, offering increased precision in measurements compared to classical methods.  Biophysics explores potential entanglement within biological systems, though its role remains largely speculative.  Philosophically, entanglement challenges our understanding of realism and locality, prompting debates on the nature of reality and the limits of causal explanations.  Ongoing research across physics, computer science, and philosophy continues to unravel the profound mysteries and potential applications of this remarkable quantum phenomenon.
