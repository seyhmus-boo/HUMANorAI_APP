Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon of quantum mechanics, remains a subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigation.  This review summarizes key aspects of entanglement, focusing on its fundamental nature and implications.  Entanglement, where two or more particles exhibit correlated behaviour regardless of spatial separation, violates classical intuitions of locality and realism.  Bell's theorem and subsequent experimental violations have definitively established the non-classical nature of entanglement.  The review explores different types of entanglement, including Bell states and GHZ states, along with quantification methods such as entanglement entropy and concurrence.  Significant progress has been made in utilizing entangled states for quantum information processing, including quantum cryptography and quantum computing.  However, challenges remain, particularly in scaling up entangled systems and preserving their coherence against decoherence.  Future research directions include exploring the potential of entanglement in novel technologies, investigating its role in fundamental physics, and developing more robust methods for generating and manipulating entangled states.  This review provides a concise overview of the current understanding of quantum entanglement, highlighting its profound implications for both fundamental science and technological advancements.
