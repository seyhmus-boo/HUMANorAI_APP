The formation of black holes, enigmatic objects predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity, remains a topic of intense astrophysical investigation.  While the theoretical framework is well-established, the precise mechanisms governing their genesis across a range of stellar masses continue to challenge our understanding.  This paper reviews current models of black hole formation, focusing on recent advancements that refine our comprehension of both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  Significant progress has been made in numerical simulations, accurately modelling the final stages of stellar collapse and the ensuing gravitational collapse into a singularity. These simulations incorporate increasingly sophisticated equations of state, accounting for effects of strong magnetic fields and rotation, providing a more nuanced understanding of the jet formation often observed in these events.  Furthermore, the advent of gravitational wave astronomy, exemplified by detections from LIGO and Virgo, has offered unprecedented observational evidence of binary black hole mergers, providing crucial constraints on their formation channels and population properties.  This paper will critically assess these recent developments, exploring the implications for our understanding of galactic evolution and the broader cosmological context in which black holes reside.
