Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with unique cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional material properties stemming from their spÂ²-hybridized carbon network and high aspect ratio.  This review summarizes key properties relevant to diverse applications.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, with tensile moduli exceeding those of steel, coupled with high flexibility and resilience, makes them ideal for reinforcement composites.  Remarkable electrical conductivity, dependent on chirality, ranges from metallic to semiconducting behaviour, offering potential for nanoelectronics and sensors.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity along the tube axis, enabling efficient heat dissipation in microelectronics.  Their large surface area facilitates adsorption and catalysis, opening avenues for energy storage and environmental remediation.  However, challenges remain, including efficient, scalable production methods, precise control over chirality, and overcoming aggregation tendencies which limit their processability.  Future research directions focus on tailored synthesis for specific applications and exploring synergistic combinations with other nanomaterials to fully leverage their potential.
