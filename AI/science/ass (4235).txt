Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a topic of significant experimental challenge.  While theoretical models robustly predict black hole formation from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars or through mergers of compact objects, directly observing this process remains elusive. This presentation will focus on the key experimental hurdles hindering our understanding of black hole genesis. We will explore the limitations of current observational techniques, specifically addressing the difficulties in resolving the highly energetic and transient nature of stellar collapse using electromagnetic and gravitational wave astronomy.  The challenges inherent in distinguishing between competing models of black hole formation, such as direct collapse versus accretion-induced collapse, will be discussed. Further, we will examine the technological limitations in achieving the necessary sensitivity and resolution for detecting pre-collapse signatures and the subtle post-collapse gravitational wave echoes. Finally, we will briefly discuss future observational strategies, including multi-messenger astronomy and advanced detector technology, which hold promise for overcoming these experimental challenges and providing a clearer picture of black hole formation across cosmic time.
