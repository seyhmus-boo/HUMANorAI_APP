Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a subject of intense investigation.  This presentation will review the established mechanisms of stellar-mass black hole formation through the gravitational collapse of massive stars, highlighting recent advancements in numerical relativity simulations which are improving our understanding of the complex processes involved, including the influence of magnetic fields and rotation.  We will discuss the limitations of current models in accurately predicting black hole masses and spins from progenitor star properties.

Furthermore, we will explore the formation pathways of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), focusing on recent debates surrounding the relative contributions of direct collapse and the merging of stellar-mass black holes.  The implications of recent gravitational wave detections, which provide direct evidence for binary black hole mergers, will be considered in the context of SMBH growth.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the ongoing efforts to probe the earliest stages of black hole formation in the universe, including observations from next-generation telescopes and the potential role of primordial black holes.  The presentation aims to synthesize recent theoretical and observational findings, offering a contemporary perspective on this dynamic field.
