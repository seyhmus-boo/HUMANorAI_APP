Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in stellar evolution, driven by the inexorable force of gravity.  This lecture will explore the primary pathways leading to their creation.  For stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses, core collapse supernovae are the dominant mechanism. Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel, the core implodes under its own weight, exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.  This rapid collapse leads to the formation of a singularity, surrounded by an event horizon, defining the black hole's boundary.  Less massive stars, within the range of 8-20 solar masses, may also produce black holes through electron capture supernovae, though the precise conditions remain a subject of ongoing research.  Further, the merging of compact objects, such as neutron stars or another black hole, can generate a more massive black hole through accretion and gravitational wave emission.  This lecture will detail the physical processes involved in each formation scenario, highlighting the crucial role of stellar mass, composition, and angular momentum in determining the ultimate fate of a star.
