Catalysts have revolutionized organic chemistry, enabling reactions otherwise inaccessible under practical conditions.  Their historical significance dates back to the early 19th century with Berzelius's conceptualization of catalysis, though its mechanistic understanding remained rudimentary.  Early applications focused largely on inorganic catalysts in industrial processes.  The 20th century witnessed a dramatic expansion with the development of organometallic catalysts, pioneered by Wilkinson's homogeneous hydrogenation catalyst, revolutionizing areas like asymmetric synthesis.

Modern organic chemistry relies heavily on catalysts to achieve high selectivity and efficiency.  These catalysts, encompassing homogeneous (dissolved in the reaction medium) and heterogeneous (separate phase) systems, often exploit transition metal complexes to activate reactants through coordination and redox processes.  Examples include palladium-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions (Suzuki, Heck, Stille), crucial for C-C bond formation, and asymmetric catalysis using chiral ligands to control stereochemistry.  Enzyme catalysis, a biologically relevant subset, offers exceptional selectivity and operates under mild conditions. Ongoing research focuses on developing more sustainable, environmentally benign catalysts, including biocatalysts and metal-free alternatives, aiming to enhance atom economy and minimize waste.
