This presentation provides a quantum mechanical overview of nuclear fission processes, moving beyond the classical liquid drop model to incorporate crucial quantum effects. We will explore the role of quantum tunneling in initiating fission, highlighting its significance in overcoming the fission barrier and determining fission probabilities.  The discussion will encompass the quantum nature of collective nuclear motion, emphasizing the importance of understanding the coupled vibrations and rotations of the nucleus as it deforms and ultimately fissions.  Furthermore, we will delve into the quantum mechanical description of the resulting fission fragments, emphasizing the distribution of mass, charge, and excitation energy.  Specifically, the impact of shell effects on fragment yields and the role of quantum correlations in the final state will be examined.  By integrating these quantum mechanical considerations, we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of the fission process, moving beyond simple statistical models to capture the inherently probabilistic and quantum nature of this fundamental nuclear reaction.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the implications of a refined quantum mechanical description for applications in nuclear energy and nuclear waste management.
