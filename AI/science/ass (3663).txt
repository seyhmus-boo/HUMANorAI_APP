Nuclear fission is the process whereby a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into smaller nuclei upon neutron bombardment, releasing a significant amount of energy and further neutrons.  This chain reaction, sustained by the liberated neutrons inducing further fissions, forms the basis of nuclear power generation.  The energy released manifests as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted radiation, including gamma rays and beta particles.  The precise mechanism involves the formation of an unstable compound nucleus, which subsequently undergoes asymmetrical fission, yielding a range of fission products with varying mass numbers and radioactive decay properties.  The number of neutrons released per fission event (neutron multiplicity) dictates the chain reaction's criticality.

Practical applications primarily focus on energy production.  Nuclear fission reactors utilize controlled chain reactions to generate heat, subsequently converted into electricity via steam turbines.  This provides a high-energy density power source, mitigating reliance on fossil fuels.  Beyond energy, fission finds application in the production of medical isotopes used in diagnosis and treatment, and in neutron activation analysis, a technique for elemental composition determination.  However, the inherent radioactivity of fission products and the potential for catastrophic accidents necessitate rigorous safety protocols and waste management strategies.
