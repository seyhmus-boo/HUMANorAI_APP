Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems exhibit correlated behaviour regardless of spatial separation, presents significant experimental challenges.  The primary difficulty lies in maintaining the delicate quantum superposition required for entanglement.  Environmental decoherence, arising from interactions with the surrounding environment, rapidly destroys entanglement, limiting the coherence time and necessitating cryogenic temperatures and sophisticated shielding techniques.  Furthermore, generating and verifying entanglement necessitates precise control over individual quantum systems, often involving complex laser systems and advanced manipulation techniques like optical traps or superconducting circuits.  The probabilistic nature of quantum processes adds another layer of complexity, with successful entanglement generation often requiring numerous trials and sophisticated error correction protocols.  Accurate measurement of entangled states also presents a formidable obstacle, as  even minute imperfections in detectors can introduce significant errors and obfuscate the true degree of entanglement.  Overcoming these hurdles is crucial for advancing quantum technologies reliant on entanglement, such as quantum computing and communication.
