Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, exhibit a remarkable array of properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed solely of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms.  These structures, typically ranging from nanometers to micrometers in length and with diameters on the order of nanometers, exist in two primary forms: single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).  Their exceptional mechanical properties include extraordinarily high tensile strength and Young's modulus, significantly exceeding that of steel, making them attractive for reinforcement in composite materials.  Electrically, CNTs demonstrate remarkable versatility, exhibiting metallic conductivity in certain chiral arrangements and semiconducting behaviour in others, dependent on their diameter and chirality. This tunable conductivity opens avenues for applications in electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional thermal conductivity along their axial direction, contributing to their potential in thermal management applications.  Finally, their large surface area facilitates diverse applications in catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery.  The precise control over CNT synthesis and their inherent tunability continue to drive extensive research and development across numerous technological domains.
