Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, present significant experimental challenges hindering their widespread application.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains elusive, resulting in heterogeneous samples with variations in diameter, chirality, and structural defects.  These variations significantly impact their final properties, making consistent characterization and reproducible results difficult to achieve.  Furthermore, the high aspect ratio of CNTs complicates dispersion in matrices, necessitating the use of sophisticated techniques to prevent aggregation and achieve uniform distribution. Accurate measurement of individual CNT properties is hampered by the challenges of isolating and manipulating single nanotubes, often requiring advanced microscopy techniques with limited throughput.  Determining the precise chirality, a key determinant of electronic properties, remains a complex undertaking, relying on laborious and high-resolution spectroscopic methods.  Finally, the inherent difficulty in separating metallic and semiconducting nanotubes in as-synthesized samples necessitates post-synthesis purification, which can be both time-consuming and potentially damaging to the nanotubes themselves, further adding complexity to experimental investigations.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is critical to realizing the full potential of CNTs in advanced materials and technologies.
