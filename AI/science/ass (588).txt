Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon bonding.  This lecture will explore key characteristics.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel, are attributed to the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheet structure.  Furthermore, CNTs display remarkable electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality and diameter, offering potential for advanced electronic applications.  Their thermal conductivity surpasses that of most materials, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  Finally, the high surface area of CNTs contributes to significant adsorption capabilities, finding applications in catalysis, gas storage, and environmental remediation.  However, challenges remain in large-scale, controlled synthesis and the dispersion of CNTs in composite materials.  This lecture will provide an overview of these properties and their implications for diverse technological fields.
