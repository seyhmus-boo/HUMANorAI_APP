The formation of black holes, astrophysical objects of immense gravitational pull, remains a captivating area of research at the interface of classical general relativity and quantum mechanics. While general relativity provides a robust framework for describing the macroscopic properties and gravitational dynamics of black holes, a complete understanding necessitates incorporating quantum mechanical effects, particularly near the singularity where spacetime curvature becomes infinite. This research paper explores the intricacies of black hole formation through a quantum mechanical lens, examining the limitations of purely classical approaches and investigating the potential contributions of quantum gravity theories. We will focus on the critical stages leading to gravitational collapse, highlighting how quantum phenomena might influence the process of stellar evolution culminating in black hole genesis. This includes analyzing the role of quantum fluctuations in the initial density perturbations of collapsing stars, the potential modification of spacetime geometry at Planck scales, and the implications of Hawking radiation for black hole evaporation and information paradox. By integrating quantum mechanics into the description of black hole formation, this paper aims to contribute to a more comprehensive and accurate theoretical model, addressing unresolved discrepancies between observations and classical predictions, and paving the way for a unified theory of gravity.
