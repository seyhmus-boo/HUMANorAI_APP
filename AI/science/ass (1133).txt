Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, operates via two primary interconnected mechanisms: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle (light-independent reactions).  The light-dependent reactions, occurring within thylakoid membranes, involve photosystems I and II.  Photon absorption by chlorophyll molecules excites electrons, initiating an electron transport chain that generates a proton gradient. This gradient drives ATP synthase, producing ATP.  Simultaneously, water is split (photolysis), releasing oxygen and providing electrons to replenish those lost by photosystem II.  NADP+ is reduced to NADPH, utilizing electrons from photosystem I.  ATP and NADPH, the products of the light-dependent reactions, then fuel the Calvin cycle.  This cyclical process, occurring in the stroma, uses ATP and NADPH to carboxylate ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP), ultimately synthesizing glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (G3P), a precursor to glucose.  Regulation of photosynthesis involves intricate feedback mechanisms controlling enzyme activity and light harvesting, ensuring efficient energy capture and carbohydrate production under varying environmental conditions.
