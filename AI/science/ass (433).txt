Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a subject of ongoing intense research.  Its counter-intuitive nature, defying classical notions of locality and realism, was first predicted by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen (EPR) in their seminal 1935 paper, which paradoxically aimed to demonstrate the incompleteness of quantum mechanics.  The EPR paradox highlighted the seemingly paradoxical correlations between entangled particles, suggesting a violation of local realism â€“ the idea that physical systems possess pre-existing properties independent of measurement and that influences cannot travel faster than light.

Subsequent experimental work, notably the Bell inequality tests conducted from the 1960s onwards, decisively refuted local realism, validating the predictions of quantum mechanics and confirming the existence of entanglement.  These experiments, employing increasingly sophisticated techniques, have demonstrated the strong correlations between entangled particles, surpassing the classical limits imposed by Bell's theorem.  This profound discovery has not only deepened our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality but also paved the way for transformative applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum sensing. This paper will explore the theoretical underpinnings of quantum entanglement, review key experimental advancements, and discuss its potential for future technological breakthroughs.
