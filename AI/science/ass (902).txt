Nuclear fission, the splitting of an atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Its historical roots lie in the theoretical work of Meitner, Frisch, and Hahn, culminating in the experimental observation of uranium fission induced by neutron bombardment in 1938. This breakthrough fundamentally altered our understanding of nuclear structure and unleashed immense energy, initially harnessed through the development of atomic weapons during World War II.  Subsequent research elucidated the underlying mechanisms, revealing the crucial roles of neutron emission, critical mass, and the release of substantial binding energy, primarily explained by the liquid drop model.  The controlled release of fission energy through nuclear reactors followed, providing a significant—albeit controversial—source of electricity globally.  Contemporary research focuses on improving reactor efficiency and safety, exploring novel fissionable materials, and addressing the challenges of nuclear waste management.  Understanding the intricacies of fission processes remains vital for advancing both energy production and nuclear security.
