Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them attractive for diverse applications.  Their unique structure, comprising spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices, results in exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, surpassing those of steel.  Electrical conductivity varies significantly depending on chirality and diameter; single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials, while multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) generally exhibit metallic behavior.  High thermal conductivity, stemming from strong covalent bonding and efficient phonon transport, makes CNTs promising for thermal management applications.  However, challenges remain, including the precise control over CNT synthesis to achieve desired chirality and length distributions, as well as efficient dispersion and functionalization for integration into composite materials.  Ongoing research focuses on addressing these challenges to unlock the full potential of CNTs in advanced technologies such as nanoelectronics, composites, energy storage, and biomedical devices.  This review summarizes the key properties of CNTs and highlights the ongoing efforts towards their practical implementation.
