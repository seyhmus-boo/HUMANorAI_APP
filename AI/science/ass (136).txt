Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon of quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems that transcends classical physics.  This correlation persists even when the entangled particles are spatially separated, exhibiting strong correlations in their measured properties, violating Bell's inequalities.  The entangled state, a superposition of multiple quantum states, is described mathematically by a non-separable wavefunction, implying that the individual particles do not possess definite properties prior to measurement.  Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, regardless of distance, leading to seemingly paradoxical non-local correlations.  This non-locality has significant implications for quantum information science, forming the basis for quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  Current research focuses on improving the generation, manipulation, and characterization of entangled states, exploring various physical systems including photons, trapped ions, and superconducting circuits, with the ultimate goal of realizing scalable and fault-tolerant quantum technologies.  Furthermore, fundamental investigations continue to probe the nature of quantum entanglement and its implications for our understanding of reality.
