Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic synthesis, enabling reactions under milder conditions and affording higher selectivity and efficiency.  However, the application of catalysts often presents significant experimental challenges. This presentation will discuss key hurdles encountered in the practical utilization of catalysts in organic chemistry.  Specifically, we will examine challenges related to catalyst synthesis and characterization, including the complexities of preparing highly pure and well-defined catalytic species, often hampered by aggregation or decomposition.  Furthermore, the difficulties associated with catalyst loading optimization and efficient catalyst recovery and recycling will be addressed, emphasizing the economic and environmental impact of catalyst waste.  We will highlight the challenges posed by substrate-catalyst incompatibility, including catalyst poisoning and deactivation,  and illustrate their influence on reaction yield and selectivity. Finally, the presentation will briefly outline emerging strategies aimed at mitigating these experimental challenges, such as the development of heterogeneous catalysts, supported catalysts, and flow chemistry approaches.  These strategies offer potential solutions to improve catalyst efficiency and sustainability in organic synthesis.
