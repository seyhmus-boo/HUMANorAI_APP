This presentation provides a concise overview of quantum entanglement from a purely quantum mechanical perspective, eschewing philosophical interpretations. We will focus on the mathematical formalism underpinning this phenomenon, highlighting its departure from classical intuition.  The presentation begins with a review of the fundamental postulates of quantum mechanics, specifically focusing on the tensor product structure of composite systems.  We will then introduce the concept of entangled states, demonstrating how they violate Bell's inequalities and showcasing examples such as Bell states and GHZ states.  The crucial role of the density matrix formalism in characterizing entangled and separable states will be discussed, emphasizing the concept of entanglement entropy as a quantifier of entanglement.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the implications of entanglement for quantum information processing, highlighting its significance in quantum teleportation and quantum computing.  This presentation aims to provide a rigorous, yet accessible, introduction to the quantum mechanical foundations of entanglement, focusing on mathematical clarity and conceptual rigor.
