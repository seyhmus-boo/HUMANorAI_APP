This presentation provides a concise overview of quantum entanglement from a foundational quantum mechanical perspective. We will explore the phenomenon as a direct consequence of the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of composite quantum systems.  The presentation will begin by reviewing the essential mathematical formalism describing entangled states, focusing on Bell states as prototypical examples.  We will then discuss the implications of entanglement for the violation of Bell inequalities, highlighting the incompatibility of local realism with quantum mechanical predictions.  The role of entanglement in quantum information processing will be briefly touched upon, emphasizing its crucial role in quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution.  Finally, we will examine the ongoing challenges in understanding the fundamental nature of entanglement, including its relationship to the measurement problem and the search for a deeper, more complete theory of quantum mechanics.  The presentation aims to provide a clear and rigorous introduction to this fascinating and profoundly important aspect of quantum theory.
