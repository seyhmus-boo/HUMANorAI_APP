Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, presents profound implications for quantum technologies.  However, harnessing its potential faces significant experimental challenges.  This presentation will explore key obstacles in generating, manipulating, and maintaining entangled states, particularly focusing on scalability and decoherence.  We will examine the limitations imposed by current technological capabilities in creating high-fidelity entangled states, emphasizing the difficulties associated with achieving high entanglement purities and minimizing environmental noise.  Specific challenges addressed will include the development of robust quantum control techniques to mitigate decoherence, the creation of scalable platforms for generating entangled multi-qubit systems, and the implementation of efficient and accurate entanglement verification protocols.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss recent advancements aiming to overcome these hurdles, including novel approaches to quantum error correction and the exploration of alternative physical platforms for quantum computation.  Ultimately, this presentation aims to highlight the critical experimental frontiers that must be addressed to unlock the full potential of entangled quantum systems.
