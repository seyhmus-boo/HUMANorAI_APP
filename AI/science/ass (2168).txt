Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical carbon molecules with exceptional properties, have captivated researchers since their discovery in 1991 by Iijima. This presentation will explore the key properties of CNTs that underpin their diverse potential applications.  We will begin by briefly reviewing the historical context of their serendipitous discovery, highlighting the subsequent rapid advancement in synthesis techniques, enabling the production of both single-walled (SWCNTs) and multi-walled (MWCNTs) nanotubes.  The unique electronic structure of CNTs, determined by their chirality, will be discussed, emphasizing their potential as semiconductors or metallic conductors depending on their structure.  Furthermore, their extraordinary mechanical properties, including exceptional tensile strength and high Young's modulus, will be examined, alongside their thermal conductivity significantly exceeding that of copper.  The presentation will also briefly address the challenges associated with CNT processing, including purification, dispersion, and functionalization, essential for realizing their full technological potential. Finally, we will briefly touch upon promising applications across diverse fields, including electronics, composites, and energy storage.
