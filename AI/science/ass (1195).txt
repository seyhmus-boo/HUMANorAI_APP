Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon arising from the superposition principle, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  These entangled particles exhibit correlated behavior regardless of spatial separation, violating classical locality.  Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the state of its counterpart, a feature exploited in quantum information science.  The underlying mechanism is rooted in the shared quantum state described by a composite wavefunction that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each particle. This holistic description leads to stronger-than-classical correlations, quantifiable through measures like Bell inequalities, whose violation experimentally confirms entanglement's non-classical nature.  Current research focuses on understanding the limits of entanglement generation and manipulation, with applications spanning quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation. Challenges remain in scaling entanglement to larger systems and mitigating decoherence effects, which hinder the practical realization of quantum technologies relying on entangled states.  Further investigation into the fundamental aspects of entanglement promises significant advancements in our understanding of quantum mechanics and its technological potential.
