Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, is a complex interplay of physical, chemical, and biological mechanisms.  Fundamentally, it involves two interconnected stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The former utilizes photophysics, specifically the absorption of photons by chlorophyll and other pigments, triggering electron transport chains within photosystems I and II. This process, analyzed through spectroscopy and biophysics, generates ATP and NADPH.

The light-independent reactions, governed by enzyme kinetics and biochemistry, utilize the ATP and NADPH to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into organic molecules, primarily glucose.  This involves intricate enzyme-substrate interactions, understood through structural biology (e.g., Rubisco structure-function) and metabolic engineering.  Furthermore, the efficiency of photosynthesis is influenced by environmental factors like light intensity and CO2 concentration, studied through ecological and atmospheric science.  Understanding the complete mechanism necessitates integrating knowledge from diverse fields, highlighting photosynthesis as a prime example of interdisciplinary research.
