Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  Historically, the concept emerged from John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace's 18th-century speculations on "dark stars," objects so massive that even light could not escape their gravitational pull.  Einstein's theory of General Relativity provided the rigorous framework, predicting the existence of singularities – points of infinite density – within black holes.

The formation process begins with the exhaustion of nuclear fuel in a star significantly exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 solar masses).  Without the outward pressure generated by fusion, gravity overwhelms the star, leading to a catastrophic collapse.  For stars several times the mass of the Sun, this collapse proceeds unimpeded, forming a stellar-mass black hole.  More massive stars, exceeding tens of solar masses, may undergo pair-instability supernovae, potentially leaving no black hole remnant.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, are believed to form through a combination of stellar-mass black hole mergers and direct collapse of gas clouds in dense environments, a process still under active investigation.  Gravitational wave observations are now providing crucial insights into the dynamics of black hole mergers, significantly advancing our understanding of their formation and evolution.
