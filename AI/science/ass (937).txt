The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a cylindrical honeycomb lattice lead to unique electronic behaviour.  Depending on their chirality (the helical arrangement of the hexagonal lattice), CNTs can exhibit metallic or semiconducting properties.  This arises from the quantization of electron energy levels along the nanotube's circumference, resulting in specific energy bands that either overlap (metallic) or possess a band gap (semiconducting).  The diameter and chirality directly influence the size of this band gap, offering tunability for electronic applications.

Furthermore, the strong sp²-σ bonds within the graphitic sheets contribute to their exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness.  Quantum mechanical calculations confirm the high Young's modulus and tensile strength by analyzing the delocalized π-electron system and strong covalent bonding.  The one-dimensional nature of CNTs also results in unusual electron transport phenomena, including ballistic conduction over macroscopic lengths, owing to minimal phonon scattering.  These quantum mechanical underpinnings enable diverse applications, ranging from high-performance transistors to advanced composites.
