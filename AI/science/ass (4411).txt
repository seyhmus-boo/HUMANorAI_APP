Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns catalysts in organic chemistry.  Imagine a mountain pass:  a reaction, the journey from reactants to products, often requires surmounting a high-energy barrier, the mountain itself.  This barrier represents the activation energy. Catalysts, however, act like expertly engineered tunnels through that mountain.  They provide an alternative pathway, lowering the activation energy and thus accelerating the reaction.  They achieve this by forming temporary intermediate complexes with reactants, stabilizing the transition state.

Think of a key fitting a lock: the substrate is the lock, the product the opened door, and the catalyst, the specific key enabling the transformation. Crucially, the catalyst itself remains unchanged at the end of the process. It is not consumed; rather, it facilitates multiple reaction cycles.  It's a tireless worker, constantly assisting in the transformation of reactants to products, without itself undergoing permanent alteration.  Understanding catalytic mechanisms is fundamental to efficient and selective organic synthesis.
