Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them attractive for diverse technological applications.  Their unique structure, consisting of seamlessly rolled graphene sheets, imparts remarkable tensile strength exceeding that of steel, coupled with high flexibility and elasticity.  Electrical conductivity varies significantly depending on chirality and diameter, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, enabling their use in electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper, making them ideal for heat dissipation management.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT synthesis to achieve desired properties and in overcoming issues related to dispersion and functionalization for practical applications.  This review summarizes the fundamental properties of CNTs, highlighting the relationship between their structure and diverse functionalities.  Future research should focus on scalable, cost-effective production methods and innovative strategies for integrating CNTs into advanced materials and devices, thus unlocking their full potential across various technological sectors.
