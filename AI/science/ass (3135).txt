Plasma physics explores the collective behaviour of ionised gases, or plasmas, characterised by a significant fraction of free electrons and ions.  These systems exhibit unique phenomena driven by electromagnetic interactions, diverging significantly from neutral gas dynamics.  Fundamental processes include Debye shielding, where charged particles screen electric fields, and plasma oscillations, collective density fluctuations propagating at the plasma frequency.  Magnetic confinement, crucial in fusion research, harnesses magnetic fields to contain high-temperature plasmas, overcoming their inherent tendency to expand.  Instabilities, such as the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, pose a challenge to confinement, while wave-particle interactions, including Landau damping, mediate energy transfer within the plasma.

These phenomena find diverse practical applications.  Controlled nuclear fusion, aiming to replicate stellar energy production, relies heavily on understanding plasma confinement and stability.  Plasma processing techniques are widely used in semiconductor manufacturing for etching and deposition.  Other applications include plasma propulsion for spacecraft, plasma displays, and medical applications like plasma sterilization.  Advanced research explores the potential of plasma-based accelerators for particle physics and the development of novel materials through plasma-assisted synthesis.
