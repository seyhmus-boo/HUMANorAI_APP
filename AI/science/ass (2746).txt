Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, exhibiting stronger-than-classical correlations between the measured properties of entangled particles.  Upon measurement of one entangled particle's state, the state of the other is instantaneously determined, irrespective of distance, seemingly violating locality.  This non-local correlation arises from the superposition principle and the inseparability of the entangled state.  The precise mechanism remains a subject of ongoing debate, though interpretations invoke non-local hidden variables or a rejection of objective realism.

Practical applications of entanglement are burgeoning.  Quantum key distribution (QKD) leverages entanglement to secure communication channels, guaranteeing detection of eavesdropping attempts.  Entanglement-based quantum computing promises exponential speedups over classical algorithms, potentially revolutionizing fields like drug discovery and materials science.  Furthermore, quantum teleportation, utilizing entanglement as a resource, enables the transfer of quantum states between distant locations without physically transferring the particle itself. While technological challenges remain, the potential of entanglement to transform information science and technology is undeniable.
