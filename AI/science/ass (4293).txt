Quantum entanglement is a quintessential non-classical phenomenon arising from the superposition principle and the inseparability of composite quantum systems.  Two or more particles become entangled when their combined quantum state cannot be expressed as a product of individual states.  This means the particles' properties, such as spin or polarization, are correlated in a manner defying classical probabilistic descriptions.  

Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the others, regardless of spatial separation. This seemingly instantaneous correlation doesn't violate special relativity as no information is transmitted faster than light; the correlations pre-exist the measurement.  The entanglement is described by a joint wave function exhibiting non-local correlations, where the individual particle wave functions are undefined until a measurement collapses the overall state.  This collapse, governed by the projective measurement postulate, reveals the correlated properties, demonstrating the inherent interconnectedness imposed by the entangled state.  Understanding entanglement is crucial for advancements in quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
