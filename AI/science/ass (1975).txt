Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning cellular proliferation and heredity.  Imagine DNA as a meticulously crafted zipper: two intertwined strands, each a sequence of nucleotides.  Replication initiates when this zipper begins to unzip, catalysed by enzymes like helicases.  Each separated strand then serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.

Think of this synthesis as a skilled scribe meticulously copying a text.  DNA polymerase, our scribe, reads the template strand and adds complementary nucleotides, adhering to the base-pairing rules: adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine.  This process proceeds bidirectionally, creating two identical "daughter" zippers from the original "parent" zipper.  Importantly, proofreading mechanisms ensure fidelity, minimizing errors.  The final result: two identical DNA molecules, each comprising one original and one newly synthesized strand â€“ a semi-conservative model of replication.  Any errors that slip through are subject to repair mechanisms, maintaining the integrity of the genome.
