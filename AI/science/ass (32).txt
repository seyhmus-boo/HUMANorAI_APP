The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting gravitational singularities, remains a central problem in astrophysics.  Early theoretical groundwork, laid by Laplace in the late 18th century, considered the possibility of celestial bodies so massive that light could not escape their gravitational pull. However, it was not until Einstein's theory of General Relativity in 1915 that a rigorous theoretical framework for understanding black holes emerged.  Schwarzschild's solution to Einstein's field equations in 1916 provided the first description of a static, spherically symmetric black hole.  Subsequent work by Oppenheimer and Snyder in 1939 demonstrated the theoretical possibility of stellar collapse leading to black hole formation, solidifying the concept's plausibility.

Despite this early theoretical progress, observational evidence remained elusive for decades.  The first observational confirmations emerged in the latter half of the 20th century, with the identification of Cygnus X-1 as a strong candidate in the 1970s. Since then, advancements in observational techniques, particularly in gravitational wave astronomy and X-ray astronomy, have led to the detection and characterization of numerous black holes, spanning a vast range of masses. This paper will explore the current understanding of black hole formation, encompassing various progenitor stars and mechanisms involved in their collapse, ultimately aiming to synthesize the theoretical and observational advancements in this dynamic field.
