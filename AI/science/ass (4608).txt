Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and additional neutrons.  This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the daughter nuclei and released neutrons is less than the original nucleus, the difference being converted to energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  The released neutrons can trigger further fission events in a chain reaction, leading to a sustained release of energy, as exploited in nuclear reactors.

The criticality of a fission reaction hinges on the neutron multiplication factor; a value above unity ensures a self-sustaining chain reaction.  Control rods, typically made of neutron-absorbing materials like cadmium, regulate the reaction rate by absorbing excess neutrons.  Moderators, such as water or graphite, slow down fast neutrons to increase the probability of fission with fissile isotopes, enhancing efficiency.

Practical applications of fission processes primarily focus on energy generation in nuclear power plants, offering a high-energy density alternative to fossil fuels.  However, fission also finds applications in nuclear medicine, utilizing radioactive isotopes for diagnostic imaging and therapeutic treatments.  Furthermore, while less prevalent,  fission plays a role in the production of certain isotopes used in various industrial and scientific applications.  Despite its benefits, the inherent risks associated with radioactive waste management and potential for accidents remain crucial considerations in the continued utilization of nuclear fission.
