CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in gene editing.  However, several experimental challenges remain that hinder the widespread and reliable application of this technology. This presentation will address key obstacles encountered in CRISPR-based gene editing, focusing on three primary areas: (1) **Off-target effects:**  While improved guide RNA design and Cas variants have mitigated unintended genomic modifications, off-target activity persists and requires rigorous validation using sensitive detection methods.  We will discuss current strategies for minimizing off-target cleavage and improving target specificity. (2) **Delivery challenges:** Efficient and targeted delivery of CRISPR-Cas components remains a significant hurdle, particularly in vivo.  The presentation will explore limitations of viral and non-viral delivery systems, highlighting recent advancements in nanoparticle-mediated delivery and the ongoing need for tissue-specific and cell-type-specific delivery strategies. (3) **Mosaicism and incomplete editing:** Achieving homogenous gene editing across all target cells remains a major challenge.  The presentation will examine factors contributing to mosaicism, such as incomplete Cas activity and variations in DNA repair pathways, and will discuss potential strategies for enhancing editing efficiency and uniformity. Addressing these challenges is crucial for the safe and effective translation of CRISPR technology into therapeutic and agricultural applications.
