Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms.  These structures, either single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), confer remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  Their exceptional tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, arises from the strong covalent bonds within the graphitic lattice.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate remarkable flexibility and elasticity, capable of withstanding significant strain before failure.

Electrically, CNTs can behave as either semiconductors or metals, depending on their chirality (the arrangement of the hexagonal carbon lattice).  This tunability offers potential in electronics applications.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, making them attractive for thermal management applications.  However, challenges remain, including controlled synthesis to achieve desired chirality and the dispersion of CNTs in composite materials for practical applications, hindering their widespread use despite their remarkable potential.
