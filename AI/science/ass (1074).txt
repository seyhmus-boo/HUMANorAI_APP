Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, is a process with profound scientific and historical implications.  Its discovery, stemming from the work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and subsequently interpreted by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, revolutionized physics and ushered in the nuclear age.  This discovery revealed that the bombardment of uranium-235 with neutrons initiated a chain reaction, releasing vast quantities of energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.  This chain reaction, characterized by the cascading release of further neutrons upon fission, forms the basis of nuclear reactors and atomic weapons.

Fission processes predominantly utilize uranium-235 and plutonium-239, isotopes with high fission cross-sections.  The process involves the absorption of a neutron, forming an unstable nucleus which subsequently undergoes fission, yielding lighter fission products, typically ranging from zinc to terbium, along with the emission of several neutrons and a significant release of energy.  The energy released is primarily kinetic energy of the fission fragments, subsequently converted into heat.  Different fission pathways exist, leading to a diverse range of fission products and the release of varying numbers of neutrons, factors impacting reactor design and safety considerations.  Control of the chain reaction is crucial for harnessing fission's energy safely and efficiently.
