Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic synthesis, enabling efficient and selective transformations unattainable through stoichiometric methods.  However, their implementation often presents significant experimental challenges. This presentation will explore key difficulties encountered in catalyst development and application.  We will discuss issues related to catalyst stability, including degradation pathways under reaction conditions such as hydrolysis, oxidation, or ligand dissociation,  and strategies for enhancing longevity, such as the use of protective groups or robust ligand designs.  Furthermore, we will address challenges associated with catalyst heterogeneity, highlighting difficulties in achieving precise control over active site accessibility and the complexities of catalyst recovery and reuse.  The impact of impurities, both in starting materials and solvents, on catalyst activity and selectivity will also be examined, along with the development of robust purification and characterization methods to mitigate these effects. Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the challenges associated with scaling-up laboratory-optimized catalytic reactions to industrial processes, emphasizing the need for cost-effective and environmentally benign approaches.
