Catalysts are indispensable in organic chemistry, dramatically accelerating reaction rates and improving selectivity, thereby enhancing efficiency and sustainability.  Traditionally, homogeneous catalysts, such as transition metal complexes, dominated the field, facilitating reactions like cross-coupling and hydrogenation. However, recent developments emphasize heterogeneous catalysts and biocatalysis to address issues of catalyst separation and environmental impact.

Heterogeneous catalysts, including metal nanoparticles supported on porous materials, offer facile recovery and reuse, minimizing waste.  Significant progress involves the precise control of nanoparticle size and morphology to optimize catalytic activity and stability.  Furthermore, the burgeoning field of biocatalysis leverages enzymes' exquisite selectivity for environmentally benign transformations.  Recent breakthroughs involve engineering enzymes for enhanced activity and expanding their substrate scope through directed evolution and computational design.  These advancements, encompassing both heterogeneous and biocatalytic approaches, represent a paradigm shift towards greener and more sustainable organic synthesis.
