Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, remains incompletely understood, even within the framework of general relativity.  A fully comprehensive model necessitates incorporating quantum mechanics, given the extreme conditions near the event horizon and the singularity's inherent incompatibility with classical physics.  Current research explores several avenues.  The collapse of massive stars, the most common progenitor, involves a complex interplay of nuclear reactions and gravitational forces.  Quantum effects during the final stages, such as those arising from strong interactions within a dense quark-gluon plasma or the role of quantum tunneling in overcoming potential barriers, influence the precise characteristics of the resulting black hole.

Furthermore, the information paradox, a central challenge to our understanding, stems from the apparent loss of quantum information during black hole formation and evaporation via Hawking radiation.  Hypothetical solutions, including firewalls and fuzzballs, posit modifications to spacetime at the Planck scale, introducing quantum corrections to general relativity and altering the nature of the event horizon.  Ultimately, a complete quantum theory of gravity, currently lacking, is required to accurately describe the quantum mechanical processes underlying black hole formation, offering a unified understanding of both the macroscopic gravitational collapse and the microscopic quantum behavior at the singularity.  Ongoing research in loop quantum gravity and string theory provides promising avenues for constructing such a theory.
