Nuclear fission is the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the resulting nuclei is slightly less than the original nucleus, the difference being converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  The released neutrons can then induce further fission events in a chain reaction, provided a critical mass of fissile material is present. This chain reaction is the basis for both nuclear weapons and nuclear power plants.  In nuclear power plants, the chain reaction is carefully controlled using control rods to absorb neutrons, regulating the rate of fission and generating heat to produce steam that drives turbines, generating electricity.  Conversely, nuclear weapons exploit an uncontrolled chain reaction, resulting in a rapid and massive release of energy.  The byproducts of fission, however, include highly radioactive fission products, posing significant challenges for long-term waste management and environmental safety, necessitating robust containment and disposal strategies.
