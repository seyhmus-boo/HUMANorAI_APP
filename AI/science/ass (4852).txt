Photosynthesis, the fundamental process underpinning most life on Earth, has captivated scientists for centuries.  Early observations, dating back to the 17th century with Jan Baptista van Helmont's willow tree experiment, laid the groundwork for understanding plant growth.  However, it wasn't until the late 18th and early 19th centuries that the critical roles of light and carbon dioxide were established by Ingenhousz and de Saussure, respectively. This presentation will provide a concise overview of the intricacies of photosynthetic mechanisms, focusing on the two major pathways: C3 and C4.  We will explore the light-dependent reactions, including photosystems I and II, and the electron transport chain, culminating in ATP and NADPH production.  The subsequent light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) will be examined, highlighting the carboxylation of RuBP and the regeneration of RuBP.  Furthermore, the evolutionary advantages of C4 photosynthesis, particularly in arid and high-light environments, will be discussed. This presentation aims to provide a contemporary understanding of these complex processes built upon a historical foundation, emphasizing the remarkable adaptability of photosynthetic organisms across diverse ecological niches.
