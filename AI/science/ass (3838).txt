Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them promising materials for diverse applications.  This abstract summarizes key characteristics impacting their functionality.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel, stem from strong spÂ² hybridized carbon-carbon bonds.  Electrical conductivity varies significantly depending on chirality and diameter; single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials, offering potential for nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  However, challenges remain.  CNT synthesis often yields heterogeneous mixtures of chiral structures, complicating property control and reproducibility.  Furthermore, bundling and van der Waals interactions between nanotubes can impede individual properties.  This review highlights the unique properties of CNTs and discusses ongoing research aimed at overcoming challenges associated with their synthesis, processing, and scalable application in areas such as composites, energy storage, and sensing. Future research focusing on controlled synthesis and precise manipulation of CNT structure is crucial to realizing their full potential.
