CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient method for genome editing.  This review summarizes the current applications and limitations of CRISPR technology.  Its ease of use, coupled with high target specificity (though off-target effects remain a concern requiring further refinement), has enabled widespread adoption across diverse research fields.  Successful applications include gene knockouts, knockins, and base editing in various organisms, from bacteria to mammals, contributing significantly to disease modeling, gene therapy development, and agricultural biotechnology.  Recent advancements in CRISPR systems, such as base editors and prime editors, have expanded editing capabilities beyond simple insertions and deletions, facilitating more complex modifications. However, challenges persist, including delivery efficiency to target cells *in vivo*, the potential for unintended consequences, and ethical considerations surrounding germline editing.  Ongoing research focuses on improving specificity, developing novel delivery methods, and addressing ethical implications to harness the full potential of CRISPR technology while mitigating associated risks.  Further investigation into long-term effects and comprehensive risk assessment is crucial for responsible and beneficial implementation.
