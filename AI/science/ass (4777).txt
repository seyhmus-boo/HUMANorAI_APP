CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary gene editing technology, leverages a bacterial defense mechanism for precise genome manipulation.  The system comprises a guide RNA (gRNA), designed to target a specific DNA sequence, and the Cas9 enzyme, an endonuclease that creates a double-strand break at the targeted locus.  This break triggers the cell's endogenous DNA repair mechanisms, either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), resulting in insertions or deletions, or homology-directed repair (HDR), enabling precise gene replacement with a provided DNA template.

The versatility of CRISPR allows for diverse applications in genetic engineering.  Gene knockouts, achieved via NHEJ, facilitate functional gene studies and disease modelling.  HDR enables gene correction, offering therapeutic potential for inherited disorders like cystic fibrosis and sickle cell anaemia.  Furthermore, CRISPR facilitates precise gene regulation, influencing gene expression without altering the DNA sequence.  Beyond therapeutic applications, CRISPR finds utility in agricultural biotechnology, enhancing crop yields and disease resistance, and in basic research, facilitating the creation of genetically modified organisms for various experimental purposes.  However, ethical considerations surrounding its use in germline editing remain a significant area of ongoing debate.
