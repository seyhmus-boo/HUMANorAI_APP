Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties attracting significant interdisciplinary research.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, exceeding that of steel, finds application in materials science, enhancing the tensile strength and flexibility of composites.  Their unique electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, fuels advancements in electronics and sensing technologies, with potential for high-frequency transistors and highly sensitive biosensors.  Furthermore, their high aspect ratio and surface area contribute to significant advancements in energy storage, acting as high-capacity electrodes in batteries and supercapacitors.  The strong light-matter interaction exhibited by CNTs opens possibilities in optoelectronics and photonics, with applications in advanced optical devices and biomedical imaging.  However, challenges remain, particularly regarding scalable and cost-effective production, as well as the management of their inherent toxicity.  Interdisciplinary collaboration encompassing materials science, chemistry, physics, engineering, and biology is crucial to overcome these hurdles and fully exploit the extraordinary potential of CNTs across diverse scientific and technological fields.
