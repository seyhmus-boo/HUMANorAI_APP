Good morning. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a fascinating process within astrophysics.  Stellar-mass black holes originate from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses under its immense self-gravity.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit – approximately three times the mass of our Sun – even neutron degeneracy pressure cannot resist further collapse, resulting in a singularity surrounded by an event horizon.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, possess origins less certain, though likely involving accretion of matter and mergers of smaller black holes.

The study of black hole formation is crucial for several reasons. Gravitational wave astronomy, detecting ripples in spacetime from merging black holes, provides invaluable insights into their formation and evolution.  Understanding these processes refines our cosmological models, particularly regarding galaxy formation and evolution. Furthermore, the intense gravitational fields surrounding black holes offer opportunities to test Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in extreme environments, potentially revealing new physics.  Ultimately, unraveling the mysteries of black hole formation enhances our comprehension of the universe's structure and dynamics.
