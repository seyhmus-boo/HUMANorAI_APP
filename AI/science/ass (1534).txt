Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 through transmission electron microscopy, exhibit a unique combination of exceptional properties stemming from their distinctive cylindrical structure composed of sp²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices.  These properties render CNTs highly attractive for numerous applications.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel by several orders of magnitude, is coupled with remarkable flexibility and elasticity.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptionally high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of many metals, making them ideal for thermal management applications.  Their electrical conductivity is equally impressive, exhibiting metallic behavior depending on chirality—the arrangement of carbon atoms in the nanotube lattice—while others display semiconducting properties, offering possibilities for advanced electronic devices.  Finally, CNTs possess a large surface area, leading to significant applications in catalysis and adsorption.  This unique confluence of mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties, combined with their lightweight nature, continues to drive extensive research into the synthesis, functionalization, and application of carbon nanotubes across diverse fields.
