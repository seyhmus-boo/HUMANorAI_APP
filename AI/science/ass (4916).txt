Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become interconnected, regardless of the physical distance separating them.  This interconnection manifests as a correlated behavior: measuring the property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the measurable properties of the other, even if they are light-years apart. This correlation surpasses classical physics, defying locality and suggesting a non-local connection. The underlying mechanism arises from the superposition principle; entangled particles exist in a combined quantum state until measured, collapsing into a definite state that is correlated with the other particle's state.  

Practical applications of entanglement are actively being explored.  Quantum computing leverages entanglement to enable significantly faster computation through quantum superposition and entanglement-based algorithms.  Quantum cryptography utilizes the inherent unpredictability of entangled particle measurements to create secure communication channels, virtually impervious to eavesdropping.  Furthermore, quantum teleportation, while not transmitting matter, exploits entanglement to transfer quantum states between particles, paving the way for advanced quantum networks and potentially revolutionary technologies in quantum sensing and metrology.  Despite the challenges in scaling and maintaining entanglement, its potential to revolutionize various fields remains immense.
