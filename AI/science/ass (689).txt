Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, present significant experimental challenges despite their theoretical promise.  Their high aspect ratio, typically exceeding 1000:1, complicates manipulation and characterization.  Precise control over chirality, crucial for tailoring electronic properties (metallic vs. semiconducting), remains a significant hurdle in synthesis, leading to inhomogeneous samples that confound accurate property measurement.  Furthermore, the strong van der Waals forces between individual CNTs lead to bundling, hindering the individual characterization of their intrinsic properties and making the isolation of single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) a considerable challenge.  Precisely measuring mechanical strength requires techniques capable of applying and measuring forces at the nanoscale while avoiding damage to the fragile structure.  Similarly,  accurate thermal conductivity measurements are complicated by phonon scattering at tube junctions and defects, and by the difficulty in isolating heat flow through individual nanotubes within a bundle.  Overcoming these experimental obstacles is vital for the realization of CNT-based applications.
