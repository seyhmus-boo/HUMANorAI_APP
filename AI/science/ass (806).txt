DNA replication is a semiconservative process, whereby each strand of the parental double helix serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.  This process, crucial for cellular proliferation and heredity, is initiated at specific origins of replication, forming replication forks where DNA polymerases synthesize new strands in a 5' to 3' direction.  Leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously, while lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously in Okazaki fragments, requiring RNA primers and subsequent ligation.

Recent developments have significantly advanced our understanding of this fundamental process.  High-resolution imaging techniques, such as cryo-electron microscopy, have provided unprecedented detail on the structure and dynamics of the replisome, the complex of proteins involved in replication.  Furthermore, studies employing single-molecule techniques have elucidated the intricate mechanisms of polymerase processivity, proofreading, and the coordination between leading and lagging strand synthesis.  These advancements are revealing the remarkable fidelity and robustness of DNA replication, highlighting the role of accessory proteins in overcoming topological challenges and maintaining genomic stability, even in the face of replicative stress.  Ongoing research continues to explore the complex interplay of these factors and their implications for disease pathogenesis and potential therapeutic interventions.
