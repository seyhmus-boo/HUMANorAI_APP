Catalysts are indispensable in organic chemistry, significantly accelerating reaction rates and enhancing selectivity without being consumed in the overall process.  Their action typically involves lowering the activation energy of a reaction via the formation of intermediate catalyst-substrate complexes, thus opening pathways inaccessible under uncatalyzed conditions.  This influence extends across diverse reaction classes, including oxidations, reductions, and C-C bond formations.  Homogeneous catalysts, dissolved in the reaction mixture, often exhibit high activity and selectivity due to precise interactions with substrates, while heterogeneous catalysts, present in a separate phase, offer advantages in terms of ease of separation and catalyst recovery.

Practical applications are ubiquitous.  Zeolites, heterogeneous acid catalysts, are crucial in petrochemical processes like cracking and isomerization.  Transition metal complexes, like Wilkinson's catalyst, facilitate selective hydrogenations, vital in pharmaceutical and fine chemical synthesis.  Organocatalysis, employing small organic molecules, has emerged as a powerful tool for asymmetric synthesis, generating enantiomerically pure compounds essential in drug development.  Furthermore, enzymatic catalysis, utilizing biological catalysts, plays a central role in biotransformations and green chemistry initiatives, enabling efficient and environmentally benign syntheses.  The continued development of novel catalysts remains a major focus, driven by the need for more sustainable and efficient chemical processes.
