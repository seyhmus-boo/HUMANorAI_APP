Catalysts in organic chemistry are substances that accelerate reaction rates without being consumed themselves.  Their efficacy stems from their ability to lower the activation energy of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower energy transition state. This is achieved through the formation of intermediate complexes between the catalyst and reactants, facilitating bond breaking and formation.  Catalysts can be homogeneous, dissolving in the reaction mixture, or heterogeneous, existing in a separate phase.

Homogeneous catalysts often involve transition metal complexes that coordinate to reactants, activating them for subsequent reactions.  Heterogeneous catalysts, such as zeolites or supported metal nanoparticles, offer advantages in terms of ease of separation and recyclability.

Practical applications are ubiquitous.  In industrial processes, catalysts are essential for the production of polymers (e.g., Ziegler-Natta catalysts in polyethylene synthesis), pharmaceuticals (e.g., asymmetric catalysis for chiral drug synthesis), and fine chemicals.  In greener chemistry, catalysts enable reactions under milder conditions, reducing energy consumption and waste generation.  Furthermore, enzyme catalysis, utilizing biological catalysts, plays a vital role in numerous biochemical transformations, including metabolic processes within living organisms.
