Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a source of ongoing investigation.  This review summarizes key aspects of entanglement, exploring its theoretical foundations rooted in the superposition principle and the violation of Bell inequalities.  Experimental verification, ranging from photons and ions to superconducting circuits, consistently demonstrates the existence and robustness of entanglement, despite the challenges posed by decoherence.  Applications leveraging entanglement's non-classical correlations are burgeoning, including advancements in quantum computing, cryptography, and metrology.  However, several open questions persist, notably concerning the fundamental nature of entanglement and its potential implications for interpretations of quantum mechanics.  Future research directions will likely focus on enhancing the scalability and control of entangled systems, exploring more complex forms of entanglement, and developing practical quantum technologies based on these non-classical correlations.
