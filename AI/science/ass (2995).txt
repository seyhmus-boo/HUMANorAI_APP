Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of carbon atoms, have captivated scientific interest since their discovery in 1991 by Sumio Iijima.  This groundbreaking observation, initially revealed through transmission electron microscopy, marked the beginning of intensive research into the remarkable properties of these novel materials.  Iijima's work, building upon earlier theoretical predictions of cylindrical graphene structures, unveiled a class of nanomaterials possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  Subsequent research has focused on understanding and exploiting these properties, leading to the exploration of diverse applications spanning electronics, composites, energy storage, and biomedical engineering.  This paper delves into the fundamental properties of CNTs, examining their unique structural variations, namely single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), and their consequential impact on macroscopic material behaviours.  We will explore their exceptional tensile strength, high electrical conductivity (varying with chirality), exceptional thermal conductivity, and significant surface area, highlighting both the advantages and challenges associated with their synthesis, characterization, and practical implementation.  The review will conclude by discussing current limitations and future directions for research in this rapidly evolving field.
