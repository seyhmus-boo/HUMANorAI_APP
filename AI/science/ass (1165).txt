Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential across diverse applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  This presentation will focus on key difficulties encountered during the characterization and manipulation of CNTs.  We will discuss the challenges associated with achieving high purity and well-defined chirality, crucial for consistent material properties.  Furthermore,  the inherent tendency of CNTs to agglomerate due to strong van der Waals forces presents obstacles to effective dispersion and processing, hindering their integration into functional devices.  Precise control over CNT length and diameter distribution remains a significant hurdle, impacting macroscopic material properties.  Finally, the difficulties in accurately characterizing the structural and electronic properties of individual CNTs, particularly chirality determination, will be examined.  The presentation will conclude by highlighting ongoing research efforts aimed at addressing these experimental challenges, enabling the full exploitation of CNTs' remarkable potential.
