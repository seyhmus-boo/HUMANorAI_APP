DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating the genome, is crucial for cellular proliferation and heredity.  Initiation involves the unwinding of the double helix at origins of replication by helicases, stabilized by single-strand binding proteins.  This creates replication forks, progressing bidirectionally.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, the main replicative enzyme, to extend.  DNA polymerase III adds deoxyribonucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, generating Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase then seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, creating a continuous lagging strand.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity inherent to DNA polymerases and various repair mechanisms.  The precise coordination of these enzymatic activities ensures accurate and efficient duplication of the genetic blueprint.  Errors, though rare, can lead to mutations with potential phenotypic consequences.
