Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns chemical bonding and its influence on molecular structure.  Essentially, atoms, the fundamental building blocks of matter, rarely exist independently.  Think of them as social individuals – they prefer to interact and form stable relationships, analogous to bonds. These bonds arise from the electrostatic attraction between atoms, primarily involving their outermost electrons.  

We can categorize these interactions: ionic bonds, like a strong magnetic clasp, involve the complete transfer of electrons creating charged ions that are strongly attracted.  Covalent bonds, on the other hand, are more akin to a shared resource; electrons are shared between atoms, resulting in a stable molecule.  The number and arrangement of these bonds dictate the molecule's three-dimensional structure, influencing its properties.  Consider methane (CH₄): the four covalent bonds between carbon and hydrogen dictate a tetrahedral arrangement, impacting its reactivity and physical characteristics.  Understanding these fundamental bonding principles is crucial for predicting and interpreting the behaviours of countless substances.
