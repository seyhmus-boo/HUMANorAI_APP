Nuclear fission is the process whereby a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  This process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the nucleus to become unstable and subsequently undergo fission.  The released neutrons can then trigger further fission events in a chain reaction, leading to a sustained release of energy.  The energy released is a consequence of the mass defect, a difference in mass between the original nucleus and the resulting fission products, as described by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  The control of this chain reaction is paramount in practical applications.  Nuclear fission forms the basis of nuclear power generation, where the controlled chain reaction in a reactor core heats water to produce steam, driving turbines to generate electricity.  Furthermore, fission has been utilized in the creation of nuclear weapons, though the uncontrolled nature of this application presents significant dangers.  The byproducts of fission, however, present challenges in the form of radioactive waste requiring long-term storage and management solutions.
