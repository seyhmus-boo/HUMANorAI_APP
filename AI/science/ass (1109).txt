Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on CRISPR-Cas9's revolutionary impact on genetic engineering, highlighting its inherently interdisciplinary nature.  CRISPR, a prokaryotic adaptive immune system, has been repurposed as a precise gene-editing tool. Its success rests upon a confluence of disciplines.  Firstly, *molecular biology* provides the foundational understanding of DNA structure and function, enabling targeted gene modification.  *Biochemistry* contributes to the development and optimization of Cas9 enzyme variants, influencing efficiency and specificity.  *Computational biology* plays a crucial role in designing guide RNAs, predicting off-target effects, and analyzing large-scale genomic data generated through CRISPR applications.  Furthermore, *bioinformatics* aids in data interpretation and management. Finally, *bioethics* is essential in addressing the profound societal implications of this technology, encompassing concerns surrounding germline editing and equitable access.  Thus, CRISPR exemplifies the power of collaborative research across diverse scientific and ethical fields.
