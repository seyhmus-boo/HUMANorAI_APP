Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  Imagine a sheet of graphite, a single layer of hexagonally arranged carbon atoms – this is graphene. Now, imagine rolling that graphene sheet into a seamless cylinder; that’s essentially a CNT.  This seemingly simple structure gives rise to extraordinary properties.

Firstly, their exceptionally high tensile strength, surpassing even steel, can be likened to a microscopic cable of unparalleled resilience. Secondly, their electrical conductivity rivals that of copper, acting as efficient conductors, analogous to microscopic wires.  Furthermore, depending on their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet roll), CNTs can exhibit either metallic or semiconducting behaviour, much like a tiny, tunable switch.  Finally, their high aspect ratio – length significantly exceeding diameter – grants them unique thermal properties, functioning as exceptional heat conductors, comparable to a highly efficient microscopic heat pipe. These remarkable attributes make CNTs ideal candidates for a wide range of applications, from advanced composites to next-generation electronics.
