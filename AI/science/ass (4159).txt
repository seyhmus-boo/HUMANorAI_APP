The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting such extreme gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical work by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the late 18th century, predating Einstein's theory of General Relativity, considered the possibility of "dark stars" whose gravitational pull was so strong that light could not escape. However, it was Einstein's groundbreaking theory, published in 1915, that provided the rigorous framework for understanding black holes as solutions to his field equations.  Karl Schwarzschild's subsequent derivation of a specific solution, describing a non-rotating, spherically symmetric black hole, solidified this theoretical understanding.  The process of black hole formation itself hinges primarily on the collapse of massive stars.  When a star, many times the mass of our Sun, exhausts its nuclear fuel, the outward pressure resisting gravitational collapse is overcome.  This leads to an inexorable inward crushing, ultimately resulting in a singularity – a point of infinite density – at the center, surrounded by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which escape is impossible.  While the initial theoretical groundwork was laid in the early 20th century, observational evidence confirming the existence of black holes emerged only in the latter half of the century, primarily through the detection of their gravitational effects on nearby matter and the observation of powerful X-ray emissions from accretion disks surrounding them.
