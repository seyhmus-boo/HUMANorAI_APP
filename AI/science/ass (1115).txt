This presentation provides a concise overview of chemical bonding and molecular structure through the lens of quantum mechanics.  We will explore how the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics, specifically the Schrödinger equation and its solutions, underpin our understanding of atomic orbitals and their interactions.  The presentation will focus on the formation of covalent bonds, illustrating the concept of orbital overlap and the resulting molecular orbitals, both bonding and antibonding.  We will discuss the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approximation and its application in predicting molecular geometries and energy levels.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly touch upon the valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory, highlighting their strengths and limitations in explaining different types of chemical bonds and molecular structures.  Examples will be drawn from simple diatomic molecules like H₂ and O₂, progressing to more complex systems to illustrate the application of these concepts.  Finally, the limitations of the presented models and the role of advanced computational methods in tackling more intricate molecular systems will be briefly discussed.
