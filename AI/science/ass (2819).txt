Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique electronic structure, readily explained through quantum mechanics.  Their sp² hybridized carbon atoms form a hexagonal lattice, resulting in strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheet that constitutes the nanotube wall. The chirality, defined by the chiral vector (n,m), dictates the nanotube's diameter and electronic behavior.  Quantum confinement effects significantly impact the electronic properties.  Depending on (n,m), CNTs can behave as metallic conductors, with a linear dispersion relation near the Fermi level, or as semiconductors with a band gap inversely proportional to the diameter. This band gap arises from the quantization of electron wavefunctions along the circumferential direction, creating discrete energy levels.  Furthermore, the π-electron system contributes to high electron mobility and exceptional current carrying capacity, exceeding that of copper.  Finally, their strong mechanical strength is attributable to the robust sp² bonding, readily modeled through density functional theory calculations predicting exceptionally high Young's modulus.  These quantum mechanical underpinnings explain CNT's remarkable suitability for diverse applications in electronics, materials science, and nanotechnology.
