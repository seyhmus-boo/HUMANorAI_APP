Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon wherein two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, lies at the heart of numerous quantum technologies.  While the theoretical framework of entanglement is well-established, its practical application remains hampered by significant experimental challenges. This paper focuses on these challenges, examining the limitations imposed by current technological capabilities in generating, manipulating, and maintaining entangled states.  Specifically, we will explore the difficulties associated with achieving high fidelity entanglement, characterized by the robustness of the entangled state against decoherence from environmental noise.  The generation of entangled particles often suffers from low efficiency and requires complex and resource-intensive experimental setups, particularly for systems involving multiple entangled particles. Furthermore, maintaining the delicate entanglement over extended periods and across significant distances poses a substantial hurdle due to the sensitivity of entangled states to interactions with their surroundings. We will critically analyze these issues, reviewing recent advancements and outlining potential avenues for future research aimed at mitigating these obstacles and unlocking the full potential of entangled states for quantum computing, communication, and sensing.
