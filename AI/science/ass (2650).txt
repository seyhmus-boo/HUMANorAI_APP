DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating the genome, is crucial for cell proliferation and inheritance.  Initiation involves the unwinding of the double helix at origin sites by helicases, stabilized by single-strand binding proteins.  Topoisomerases alleviate torsional stress ahead of the replication fork.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH terminus for DNA polymerase III, the principal enzyme responsible for leading and lagging strand synthesis.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the phosphodiester backbone between Okazaki fragments, resulting in two identical daughter DNA molecules.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and various repair mechanisms.  Disruptions in this intricate process can lead to mutations and genomic instability, contributing to various diseases.
