Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in genome editing.  However, despite its widespread adoption and considerable therapeutic potential, the application of CRISPR technology remains hampered by a number of significant experimental challenges. This paper will examine these limitations, focusing on three key areas. Firstly, the issue of off-target effects, where unintended genomic modifications occur at sites distinct from the target locus, presents a major hurdle to clinical translation and necessitates the development of more precise and selective CRISPR systems.  Secondly, efficient delivery of the CRISPR-Cas machinery to target cells and tissues remains a significant obstacle, particularly for *in vivo* applications, demanding further innovation in vector design and targeted delivery strategies. Finally, the complexity of interpreting the resulting phenotypic changes following CRISPR-mediated gene editing requires sophisticated analytical techniques and careful consideration of potential compensatory mechanisms.  Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for realizing the full transformative potential of CRISPR technology across diverse fields, from disease modelling to therapeutic gene correction.
