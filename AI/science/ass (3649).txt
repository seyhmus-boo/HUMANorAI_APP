Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the mechanisms of photosynthesis, a process vital to life on Earth.  Early understanding, dating back to the 17th century with van Helmont's willow tree experiment, incorrectly attributed plant growth solely to water intake.  However, Priestley's and Ingenhousz's work in the late 18th century demonstrated the crucial role of light and air (oxygen) in this process.

Photosynthesis, at its core, is a two-stage process. The light-dependent reactions, occurring in the thylakoid membranes, utilize sunlight to energize electrons, splitting water molecules (photolysis) and generating ATP and NADPH.  These energy-carrying molecules then fuel the light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma. The Calvin cycle, elucidated by Melvin Calvin in the mid-20th century, involves the fixation of carbon dioxide into organic molecules, primarily glucose, through a series of enzymatic reactions. This effectively converts light energy into the chemical energy stored within carbohydrates.  The intricate interplay of these two stages sustains the vast majority of life on Earth.
