Black hole formation represents a critical endpoint in stellar evolution, predicated on the interplay between stellar mass and internal pressure.  This paper outlines the theoretical mechanisms underpinning this process.  Stars exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 solar masses) exhaust their nuclear fuel, leading to core collapse.  For sufficiently massive stars (â‰¥ 20 solar masses), the core's gravitational pressure overwhelms electron degeneracy pressure, resulting in a runaway collapse.  The implosion generates a catastrophic supernova explosion, expelling outer layers while the core continues to contract.  If the remnant core's mass surpasses the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (~3 solar masses), even neutron degeneracy pressure cannot withstand gravitational forces. This inexorable collapse culminates in the formation of a singularity, enveloped by an event horizon defining the black hole's boundary.  Variations in initial stellar mass and metallicity influence the precise mechanisms and progenitor characteristics, leading to diverse black hole populations observed across the cosmos.  Future research will focus on refining models to accurately predict black hole mass distributions and their contributions to galactic evolution.
