Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This linkage manifests as a correlation in their respective quantum states, such that measurement of one particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, even across vast distances. This apparent violation of locality has been rigorously experimentally verified, defying classical interpretations.

Recent developments have focused on leveraging entanglement for practical applications.  Significant progress has been made in improving the fidelity and scalability of entangled states, crucial for quantum computing and communication.  Advances in integrated photonic circuits are enabling the creation and manipulation of entangled photons on a chip, paving the way for more robust and compact quantum technologies.  Furthermore, research into entanglement distribution over increasingly longer distances, facilitated by advancements in quantum repeaters, is progressing towards the goal of a global quantum internet.  The exploration of entanglement in macroscopic systems, such as superconducting circuits, also continues to push the boundaries of our understanding and potential applications of this fundamental phenomenon.
