Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the fascinating phenomenon of quantum entanglement.  Initially conceived within the framework of early quantum mechanics, the concept, though initially met with skepticism even by Einstein, has since been experimentally verified countless times.  Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen famously articulated the EPR paradox in 1935, highlighting the apparent "spooky action at a distance" inherent in entanglement.

Entanglement describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  Measurement of a property of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of its partner, even across vast distances.  This violates classical notions of locality, where influences are limited by the speed of light.  Bell's theorem, formulated in the 1960s, provided a rigorous framework for experimentally testing the predictions of quantum mechanics against local realistic theories, ultimately supporting the validity of entanglement.  Ongoing research continues to explore the implications of entanglement for quantum computing, cryptography, and our fundamental understanding of the universe.
