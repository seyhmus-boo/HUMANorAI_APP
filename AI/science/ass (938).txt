Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon wherein two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, continues to be a subject of intense investigation.  This non-classical correlation, defying local realism, manifests in the intrinsically linked quantum states of entangled particles.  Recent developments have significantly advanced our understanding and technological applications of this peculiar phenomenon.  Advances in quantum information science leverage entanglement for quantum computing, enabling the construction of more powerful algorithms surpassing the capabilities of classical computers.  Specifically, advancements in creating and manipulating larger entangled systems, through techniques like trapped ions and superconducting circuits, have shown promise in building fault-tolerant quantum computers.  Furthermore, research into the fundamental aspects of entanglement, particularly its potential connection to gravity and spacetime, is ongoing.  Experiments exploring Bell inequalities with increasingly sophisticated setups continue to reinforce the reality of quantum entanglement and its violation of classical intuition.  The burgeoning field of quantum communication also relies heavily on entanglement for secure and high-bandwidth information transmission, with promising developments in quantum key distribution networks.
