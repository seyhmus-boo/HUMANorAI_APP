Black hole formation remains a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, bridging theoretical predictions with observational evidence.  This presentation will trace the historical evolution of our understanding, from the initial theoretical predictions of collapsed stellar remnants by Laplace and Michell in the 18th century to the contemporary observational confirmations via gravitational wave detection and imaging.  We will explore the key astrophysical mechanisms leading to black hole formation, focusing on the crucial role of stellar evolution and the Chandrasekhar limit.  The collapse of massive stars, exceeding this limit, culminates in a supernova event, often leaving behind a compact remnant â€“ a black hole.  Furthermore, we will discuss alternative formation pathways, including the direct collapse of supermassive stars in the early universe and the mergers of stellar-mass black holes, leading to the growth of supermassive black holes residing at galactic centers.  The presentation will conclude by highlighting ongoing research, including advancements in numerical simulations and multi-messenger astronomy, which are refining our understanding of this captivating phenomenon and its profound implications for the evolution of galaxies and the cosmos.
