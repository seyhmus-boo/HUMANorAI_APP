Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, represents a pivotal scientific and technological advancement with profound implications.  This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, tracing their historical development from the theoretical predictions of  Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in 1939, which explained the experimental observations of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, to the subsequent harnessing of this energy source.  We will explore the fundamental physics underpinning fission, focusing on the role of neutron interactions and the energy release through mass defect.  The presentation will then discuss the different types of fissionable materials, including uranium-235 and plutonium-239, highlighting their unique properties and practical applications.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the various reactor designs employed for controlled fission, comparing and contrasting their operational principles and safety features, concluding with a discussion of the ongoing challenges and future prospects of nuclear fission technology as a potential energy source for a sustainable future.  Specific attention will be paid to the ongoing research aimed at improving reactor efficiency and safety while mitigating nuclear waste.
