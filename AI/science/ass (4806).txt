This presentation explores the quantum mechanical underpinnings of nuclear fission processes, moving beyond the classical liquid drop model's limitations.  We will delve into the crucial role of quantum tunneling in overcoming the fission barrier, highlighting its probabilistic nature and its dependence on the nuclear shape and potential energy surface.  The presentation will discuss the impact of shell effects, arising from the quantized nature of nucleon motion, on fission probabilities and fragment distributions.  Specific focus will be placed on the role of quantum fluctuations in determining the asymmetry observed in many fission events, and how these fluctuations influence the distribution of excitation energy between the fission fragments.  Furthermore, we will briefly touch upon the application of advanced computational techniques, such as time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) and Monte Carlo simulations, in accurately modeling these inherently quantum mechanical phenomena.  Finally, we will discuss open challenges and future research directions in the quantum mechanical description of nuclear fission, particularly regarding the inclusion of collective and intrinsic degrees of freedom in a unified theoretical framework.
