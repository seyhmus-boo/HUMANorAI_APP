Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation surpasses classical physics, manifesting as a non-local connection where the measurement outcome of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, even across vast distances. This seemingly paradoxical behaviour arises from the superposition principle, where entangled particles exist in a combined state until measured, at which point the system collapses into a definite state for all involved particles.  The precise nature of this correlation is subject to ongoing debate, but its existence is experimentally verified.  Practical applications of entanglement are emerging rapidly.  Quantum computing leverages entanglement to perform computations impossible for classical computers, exploiting the superposition and entanglement of qubits for massively parallel processing. Quantum cryptography utilizes the inherent unpredictability of entangled particle measurements to create secure communication channels, impossible to eavesdrop upon without detection.  Furthermore, entanglement finds applications in quantum teleportation, enabling the transfer of quantum states between distant locations, and in precision measurements, surpassing the limitations imposed by classical noise.  The continued exploration of entanglement promises further technological advancements across diverse fields.
