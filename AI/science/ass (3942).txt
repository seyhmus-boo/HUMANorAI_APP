Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a cornerstone of both energy production and national security. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on the underlying mechanisms, influencing factors, and technological applications.  We begin by examining the fundamental physics governing fission, including the role of nuclear forces, binding energy, and the probability of fission induced by neutron bombardment.  Particular attention is given to the crucial role of neutron multiplicity and energy spectrum in sustaining chain reactions.  Furthermore, the paper explores different fissionable isotopes, comparing their relative fissilities and the resulting fission product yields.  We then analyze the technological implications of these processes, encompassing the design and operation of nuclear reactors, including both thermal and fast neutron reactors, and the challenges associated with nuclear waste management.  Finally, we discuss the ongoing research in advanced fission reactor concepts aimed at enhancing efficiency, safety, and proliferation resistance. This review contributes to a deeper understanding of the intricacies of nuclear fission and its significant impact on various scientific and technological domains.
