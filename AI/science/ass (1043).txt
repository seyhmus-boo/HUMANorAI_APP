Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon initially described by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in 1935 as a paradox highlighting potential incompleteness of quantum mechanics, signifies a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  These entangled particles exhibit correlated properties, such as spin or polarization, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  The EPR paradox challenged the principle of locality, suggesting that measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, even at vast distances.  However, Bell's theorem (1964) provided a framework for experimentally testing the predictions of quantum mechanics against local realism, with subsequent experiments overwhelmingly confirming the violation of Bell inequalities and thus supporting the reality of entanglement.  This counter-intuitive phenomenon has profound implications for our understanding of reality and has become a cornerstone of emerging quantum technologies.  Current research focuses on utilizing entanglement for quantum computing, cryptography, and precision measurement, promising advancements in diverse fields with potential for disruptive innovation.  Despite decades of research, the fundamental nature of entanglement and its implications for quantum foundations continue to be active areas of investigation.
