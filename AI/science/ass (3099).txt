Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have garnered significant interest for diverse applications.  This presentation will explore the key properties underpinning CNT utility.  Their extraordinary tensile strength and high Young's modulus make them ideal for reinforcing composite materials, enhancing their durability and strength-to-weight ratio in aerospace, automotive, and construction industries.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate remarkable electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality, offering potential for advanced electronics, including high-performance transistors and flexible displays.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, relevant for thermal management in microelectronics and energy storage systems.  This presentation will also briefly discuss challenges associated with CNT production, including scalability and purification, as well as limitations concerning their integration into practical devices.  Finally, emerging applications, such as sensors, drug delivery systems, and water filtration membranes, will be highlighted, emphasizing the ongoing research efforts towards harnessing the full potential of this remarkable nanomaterial.
