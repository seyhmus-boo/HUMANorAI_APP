Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms. This presentation will explore the key properties underpinning the vast potential applications of CNTs.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, with tensile strength exceeding that of steel, along with high elasticity and flexibility, will be discussed, emphasizing their potential in advanced composites and flexible electronics.  Furthermore, the presentation will delve into the remarkable electrical properties of CNTs, highlighting their ability to exhibit both metallic and semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality and diameter. This tunability allows for applications in high-performance transistors and other nanoelectronic devices.  Finally, the thermal conductivity of CNTs, significantly higher than that of copper, will be addressed, showcasing their potential in thermal management applications.  The presentation will conclude by briefly outlining current challenges and future research directions in harnessing the full potential of this remarkable material, emphasizing the continuing evolution of CNT synthesis and characterization techniques towards improved control over their properties and scalability for industrial applications.
