Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure.  Their cylindrical morphology, existing as single-walled (SWCNTs) or multi-walled (MWCNTs) structures, bestows them with extraordinary mechanical strength, exceeding that of steel by several orders of magnitude.  This strength, coupled with their low density, makes them attractive for numerous applications in composites.  

Furthermore, CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality and diameter, making them ideal components for nanoelectronics and sensors.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, a crucial property for thermal management applications.  However, challenges remain in controlling their precise synthesis and achieving consistent properties across large-scale production.  Moreover, toxicity concerns regarding potential health hazards associated with CNT exposure necessitate further investigation and the development of safe handling protocols.  Despite these limitations, the remarkable properties of CNTs continue to drive extensive research and development across a broad spectrum of technological fields.
