Good morning. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission, a process with profound interdisciplinary implications.  At its core, fission is the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into lighter nuclei, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. This energy release, governed by the strong and weak nuclear forces (physics), forms the basis of nuclear power generation (engineering) and nuclear weaponry (political science/international relations).

The process itself initiates with neutron bombardment, causing the nucleus to become unstable and subsequently fission.  The resulting fragments, along with further neutrons, trigger a chain reactionâ€”a concept central to reactor design (nuclear engineering) and weapon efficacy.  The released energy manifests as heat (thermodynamics), driving steam turbines to generate electricity (electrical engineering).  However, the radioactive byproducts (chemistry) pose significant challenges in waste management (environmental science) and necessitate sophisticated containment strategies (material science).  Understanding the long-term environmental impacts, including potential health consequences (medicine/public health), demands interdisciplinary collaboration.
