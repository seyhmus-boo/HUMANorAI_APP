Nuclear fission, the splitting of atomic nuclei, is a complex process with significant practical applications, primarily in energy generation.  This review summarizes the key aspects of fission processes.  The process typically involves bombarding heavy nuclei, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with neutrons, initiating a chain reaction.  This chain reaction releases vast amounts of energy due to the mass defect, a consequence of Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.  Control of the chain reaction is crucial, achieved through neutron moderators and control rods in nuclear reactors.  The released energy is harnessed to produce heat, subsequently generating steam to drive turbines and produce electricity.

While nuclear fission provides a significant carbon-free energy source, addressing the challenges of nuclear waste disposal and the potential for accidents remains paramount.  Furthermore, the application of fission in nuclear weaponry represents a distinct and morally complex area.  Research continues into improving reactor efficiency, waste management techniques, and exploring safer fissionable materials.  Despite these challenges, nuclear fission remains a critical component of global energy production and continues to be a subject of intense scientific and political discourse.
