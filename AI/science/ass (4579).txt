Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the indispensable role of catalysts in organic chemistry.  Catalysts, by definition, accelerate reaction rates without being consumed themselves, enabling synthetic pathways otherwise inaccessible under reasonable conditions.  Traditionally, homogeneous catalysts, such as transition metal complexes, dominated the field, offering exquisite selectivity.  However, their recovery and reuse pose significant challenges, driving research towards heterogeneous catalysis.

Recent advancements significantly improve catalyst efficiency and sustainability.  The development of single-site heterogeneous catalysts, where active sites are precisely defined on a support material, combines the advantages of both homogeneous and heterogeneous approaches.  Furthermore, the burgeoning field of photocatalysis utilizes light to activate catalysts, opening doors to milder reaction conditions and enhanced selectivity.  Finally, the design of biocatalysts, employing enzymes or engineered microorganisms, offers a powerful environmentally benign alternative for specific transformations, particularly in enantioselective synthesis.  These advancements are crucial for developing greener, more efficient synthetic routes in organic chemistry.
