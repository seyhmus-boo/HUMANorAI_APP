Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, releasing vast amounts of energy.  This process, underpinning nuclear power plants and weaponry, relies on the instability of certain isotopes, primarily uranium-235 and plutonium-239.  Neutron bombardment initiates fission, triggering a chain reaction as released neutrons induce further fission events.  Control of this reaction is crucial, achieved through neutron moderators and control rods in reactors.

Recent developments in fission research centre on improving reactor efficiency and safety.  Advanced reactor designs, such as Generation IV reactors, aim to enhance fuel utilization, minimize waste production, and improve inherent safety features.  Research into Accelerator Driven Subcritical Systems (ADSS) explores using particle accelerators to drive fission, potentially enabling the transmutation of nuclear waste.  Furthermore, ongoing investigations into thorium-based fuels offer a potential pathway to increased energy production and reduced proliferation risks, although significant technological hurdles remain. These advancements represent significant strides towards a safer and more sustainable future for nuclear energy.
