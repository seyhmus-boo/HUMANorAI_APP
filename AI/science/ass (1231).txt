Chemical bonding and molecular structure find their rigorous explanation within the framework of quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of atomic orbitals, governed by the Schr√∂dinger equation.  Constructive interference of atomic wavefunctions leads to the formation of bonding molecular orbitals (MOs), characterized by increased electron density between nuclei, resulting in a net attractive force.  Conversely, destructive interference generates antibonding MOs with nodal planes between nuclei, contributing to repulsive forces.  The stability of a molecule is determined by the net balance between these attractive and repulsive interactions, reflected in the overall energy of the molecule.  Molecular geometry, a crucial aspect of molecular structure, is dictated by the spatial arrangement of atomic orbitals that maximize bonding interactions while minimizing repulsions, such as those arising from electron-electron and lone-pair-lone-pair interactions.  Concepts like hybridization, where atomic orbitals combine to form new hybrid orbitals with different shapes and orientations, further explain observed molecular geometries and bond angles.  Advanced computational methods, rooted in quantum mechanics, allow for the prediction and refinement of molecular structures and bonding characteristics, providing a powerful tool for understanding chemical reactivity and properties.
