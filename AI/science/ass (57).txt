DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early experiments, such as those by Hershey and Chase (1952) confirming DNA as the genetic material, paved the way for understanding its replication mechanism.  The semi-conservative model, proposed by Watson and Crick, posited that each new DNA molecule consists of one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.  This model was experimentally validated by Meselson and Stahl (1958) using density gradient centrifugation.

Replication initiates at specific origins of replication, unwinding the double helix via helicases.  Single-stranded binding proteins prevent re-annealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, which adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, forming Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes primers, and DNA ligase joins the fragments.  Telomeres, repetitive sequences at chromosome ends, address the replication problem at lagging strand termini.  This intricate process, involving numerous enzymes and accessory proteins, ensures high fidelity genome duplication, crucial for cell division and heredity.
