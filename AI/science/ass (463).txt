Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, remains a pivotal process in energy production and scientific research. This presentation offers a concise overview of the fundamental principles governing fission, emphasizing the role of nuclear forces and the resulting energy release.  We will explore the mechanisms of induced fission, focusing on the interaction of neutrons with fissile isotopes such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, including a discussion of criticality and chain reactions.  The presentation will also address the key factors influencing the fission process, such as neutron energy, cross-sections, and the resulting fission product distribution.  Specific attention will be given to the characteristics of fission fragments, including their radioactivity and the associated challenges in nuclear waste management.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon advancements in reactor design and the potential for advanced reactor concepts to mitigate some of the inherent challenges associated with conventional fission reactors. This overview aims to provide a comprehensive yet accessible introduction to the complex physics underlying nuclear fission and its multifaceted implications.
