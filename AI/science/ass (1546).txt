The formation of black holes remains a cornerstone of astrophysical research, despite significant theoretical progress.  While stellar-mass black holes are widely accepted to form through core-collapse supernovae, directly observing this process presents immense experimental challenges.  The extreme densities and gravitational fields involved render conventional electromagnetic observation techniques largely ineffective.  Neutrino detection offers a potential avenue, but current detectors lack the sensitivity to definitively capture the crucial signals emitted during the collapse.

Similarly, the formation of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies is shrouded in mystery.  While accretion of stellar-mass black holes or direct collapse scenarios are proposed, directly observing these processes across cosmological distances is exceptionally difficult.  Gravitational wave astronomy, though a burgeoning field, offers only indirect evidence through mergers.  Furthermore, the detailed dynamics of gas accretion onto supermassive black holes, essential for understanding their growth, remain largely inferred from observations of active galactic nuclei, often hampered by obscuration and complex radiative transfer processes.  Ultimately, substantial advancements in detector sensitivity and observational techniques are required to achieve a clearer understanding of black hole formation across the entire mass spectrum.
