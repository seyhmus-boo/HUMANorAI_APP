Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a subject of ongoing intense research.  This review summarizes key aspects of entanglement, focusing on its theoretical underpinnings and experimental verification.  We discuss the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and Bell's inequalities, highlighting how experimental violations of these inequalities have decisively confirmed the existence of entanglement.  Furthermore, the review explores various applications of entanglement, including quantum cryptography, quantum teleportation, and quantum computing. While significant progress has been made in generating and manipulating entangled states, challenges remain, particularly in scaling up these systems for practical applications.  Future research directions involve improving the robustness of entangled states against decoherence and exploring novel entanglement generation and manipulation techniques.  This review concludes that entanglement is not merely a curious quantum effect, but a powerful resource with transformative potential across diverse scientific and technological domains.
