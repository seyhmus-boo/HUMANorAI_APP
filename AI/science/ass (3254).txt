Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic chemistry, enabling transformations that would otherwise be impractical or impossible.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of recent advancements in catalytic methodologies, focusing on key areas of significant progress. We will explore the burgeoning field of photoredox catalysis, highlighting its ability to facilitate challenging C-C and C-heteroatom bond formations under mild conditions, often with enhanced selectivity.  Furthermore, the increasing application of organocatalysis, specifically employing N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and chiral phosphoric acids, will be discussed, emphasizing their contributions to asymmetric synthesis and the development of environmentally benign reaction pathways.  Recent breakthroughs in the design of single-site heterogeneous catalysts, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), will be highlighted, addressing the challenges of catalyst recovery and reuse inherent in homogeneous systems. Finally, we will briefly examine the integration of AI and machine learning in catalyst design, paving the way for accelerated discovery and optimization of novel catalytic systems with improved activity and selectivity for a wide range of organic transformations.
