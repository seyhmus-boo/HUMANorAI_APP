Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, hinges on the interplay of gravity and stellar evolution, showcasing strong interdisciplinary links with nuclear physics and general relativity.  Massive stars, exceeding approximately eight solar masses, exhaust their nuclear fuel, ceasing the outward pressure that counteracts gravitational collapse.  This collapse, governed by the laws of general relativity, leads to a singularity – a point of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

Nuclear physics plays a crucial role in determining the star's lifespan and ultimate fate. The specific nuclear fusion processes within the stellar core dictate the star's mass, temperature profile, and the rate at which it consumes its fuel.  These factors directly influence whether the star's core achieves sufficient density to overcome electron degeneracy pressure, a quantum mechanical effect opposing gravitational collapse, and thus ultimately form a black hole. The intricate interplay between these gravitational and quantum phenomena, therefore, highlights the inherently multidisciplinary nature of black hole formation.  Further study involves computational astrophysics to simulate the complex hydrodynamic processes involved.
