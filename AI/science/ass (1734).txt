Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of carbon atoms.  Their discovery, albeit serendipitously, in the early 1990s by Sumio Iijima, revolutionized materials science.  These nanostructures exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics stemming from their unique sp²-hybridized carbon lattice.

Mechanically, CNTs possess extraordinary tensile strength, exceeding that of steel by several orders of magnitude, coupled with remarkable flexibility.  Electrically, their conductivity can range from metallic to semiconducting depending on their chirality – the arrangement of the hexagonal carbon lattice. This tunability offers vast potential in electronics.  Thermally, CNTs exhibit high thermal conductivity, making them ideal for heat dissipation applications.  Furthermore, their large surface area contributes to significant chemical reactivity and adsorption capabilities.  The exploitation of these diverse properties is driving innovation across numerous fields, from advanced composites to energy storage devices.
