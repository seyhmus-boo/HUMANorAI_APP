Nuclear fission is the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and ionizing radiation.  This process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the nucleus to become unstable and undergo fission.  The fission reaction also yields additional neutrons, which can, in turn, induce further fission events, leading to a self-sustaining chain reaction.  The control of this chain reaction is paramount in nuclear reactors, where the rate of fission is carefully regulated using control rods to absorb excess neutrons and prevent overheating or runaway reactions.  Practical applications of nuclear fission are primarily centered around energy production.  Nuclear power plants harness the immense heat generated during fission to produce steam, which drives turbines and generates electricity.  Furthermore, fission processes have been utilized in the production of radioisotopes for medical imaging and treatment, as well as in industrial applications such as gauging material thickness and sterilization.  However, the inherent risks associated with radioactive waste and the potential for nuclear proliferation remain significant challenges in the utilization of this powerful energy source.
