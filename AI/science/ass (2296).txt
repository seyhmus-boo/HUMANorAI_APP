Chemical bonding and molecular structure are intrinsically linked, dictating a substance's physical and chemical properties. This lecture elucidates the fundamental principles governing these interactions.  Emphasis is placed on the contrasting nature of ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding, highlighting the role of electronegativity differences and electron sharing/transfer.  Ionic bonds, arising from electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, are contrasted with the covalent bonds formed through shared electron pairs, resulting in discrete molecules with specific geometries.  The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory is introduced as a predictive model for molecular shape, explaining how electron pairs, both bonding and lone, arrange themselves to minimize electrostatic repulsion.  Finally, metallic bonding, characterized by a delocalized sea of electrons, is discussed in relation to the unique properties of metals, such as conductivity and malleability.  Understanding these bonding paradigms is crucial for predicting molecular reactivity and interpreting macroscopic properties.
