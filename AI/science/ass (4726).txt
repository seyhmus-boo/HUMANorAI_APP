Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, is a fundamental process with significant technological implications.  This lecture explored the underlying mechanism, focusing on the role of neutron bombardment in initiating the reaction.  The criticality of the fissile material, determined by its mass and geometry, was emphasized as a crucial factor in achieving a self-sustaining chain reaction.  Different fissile isotopes, primarily Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, exhibit varying fission cross-sections and energy release profiles, influencing reactor design and operation.  The lecture further addressed the byproducts of fission, including the release of substantial energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and prompt and delayed neutrons, alongside the generation of radioactive fission products, posing significant challenges for waste management.  Finally, the lecture briefly touched upon the controlled and uncontrolled nature of fission processes, contrasting the principles of nuclear reactors with those of nuclear weapons.
