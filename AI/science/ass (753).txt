DNA replication is the semi-conservative process by which a cell creates an identical copy of its DNA.  Imagine DNA as a zipper, with each side representing a single strand of nucleotides.  During replication, the "zipper" is unwound by enzymes like helicases, separating the two strands.  These separated strands then serve as templates for the synthesis of new complementary strands.  Think of this as having a half-zipper and using it to create a complete zipper by adding corresponding teeth.

This synthesis is catalyzed by DNA polymerase, which adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the growing strand, following the base-pairing rules (A with T, and G with C).  This process is not perfectly continuous; leading and lagging strands are synthesized differently due to the directional constraints of DNA polymerase. The lagging strand is synthesized in short fragments (Okazaki fragments), analogous to piecing together a mosaic.  Finally, these fragments are joined by DNA ligase, effectively completing the "zippering" process, resulting in two identical DNA molecules, each comprising one original strand and one newly synthesized strand.  This semi-conservative nature ensures faithful transmission of genetic information across generations.
