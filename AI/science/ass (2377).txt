Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have garnered significant attention across diverse scientific disciplines due to their exceptional properties.  This research paper explores the multifaceted nature of CNT properties, highlighting their interdisciplinary significance and potential applications.  Their unique combination of high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity (depending on chirality), exceptional thermal conductivity, and tunable surface chemistry makes them ideal candidates for a wide range of applications spanning materials science, electronics, medicine, and environmental engineering.  This interdisciplinary approach necessitates examining CNT properties from multiple perspectives.  We will investigate the impact of structural parameters, such as diameter and chirality, on their mechanical, electrical, and thermal behaviours, drawing connections to theoretical models and experimental observations. Furthermore, we will analyze the influence of surface functionalization on their interaction with biological systems and their potential for drug delivery and biosensing.  Finally, the paper will discuss the challenges associated with large-scale production, characterization, and the integration of CNTs into practical devices, highlighting the collaborative efforts needed for their successful implementation across various fields.
