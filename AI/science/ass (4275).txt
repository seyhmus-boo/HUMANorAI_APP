Black hole formation, a pivotal event in astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, the outward pressure counteracting gravity diminishes.  For stars exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 solar masses), electron degeneracy pressure proves insufficient, leading to an inexorable collapse.  This collapse proceeds until the density reaches a singularity, forming a black hole defined by its event horizon â€“ the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

Experimentally verifying this process presents significant challenges.  Direct observation is impossible due to the event horizon's light-trapping nature.  Instead, we rely on indirect evidence.  Observing gravitational waves emitted during the merger of black holes, as detected by LIGO and Virgo, offers compelling support. However, these observations only capture the final stage, not the complete formation process.  Furthermore, accurately modelling the complex dynamics of stellar collapse, incorporating processes like neutrino emission and magnetic field effects, remains computationally demanding, limiting our understanding of the exact conditions leading to black hole birth.  Finally, the extreme physical conditions within the collapsing star preclude direct experimental probing.
