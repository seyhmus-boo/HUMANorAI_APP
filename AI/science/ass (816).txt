Catalysts profoundly impact the rates and selectivity of organic reactions, often enabling otherwise inaccessible transformations.  A quantum mechanical perspective reveals their mechanism at the atomic level.  Catalysis fundamentally lowers the activation energy of a reaction by stabilizing the transition state, a concept readily explained through frontier molecular orbital (FMO) theory.  Catalyst interaction with reactants, often involving coordination complexes, modifies the reactant's molecular orbitals, leading to a lower energy barrier for bond breaking and formation.  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide crucial insights into reaction pathways, predicting activation energies and elucidating the role of specific catalyst orbitals in charge transfer and electron redistribution during the catalytic cycle.  Furthermore, the concept of catalyst-substrate interaction is not solely reliant on orbital interactions; dispersion forces, accurately modeled by sophisticated DFT functionals, also play a significant role, particularly in systems with weak interactions.  Ultimately, a quantum mechanical understanding of catalyst action allows for the rational design of new catalysts with tailored electronic and steric properties, enhancing efficiency and selectivity in complex organic syntheses.
