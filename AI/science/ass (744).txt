Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, have captivated researchers for their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.  Their unique nanoscale dimensions and inherent structural characteristics lead to a remarkable range of potential applications spanning diverse fields, including electronics, materials science, and medicine.  This paper reviews the fundamental properties of CNTs, focusing on recent advancements in understanding and manipulating their characteristics.  Significant progress has been made in controlling CNT chirality and diameter during synthesis, enabling precise tailoring of their electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior.  Furthermore,  advances in functionalization techniques have allowed for improved dispersion and integration of CNTs into composite materials, enhancing their macroscopic properties.  This review will examine the interplay between CNT structure, synthesis methods, and resulting properties, highlighting recent breakthroughs in characterization techniques that have enabled deeper insights into their complex behavior. We will also discuss emerging applications driven by these advancements and the remaining challenges that need to be addressed for their widespread adoption.
