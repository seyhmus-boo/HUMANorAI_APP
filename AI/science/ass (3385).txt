Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, irrespective of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation surpasses classical physics, exhibiting stronger-than-classical correlations that violate Bell's inequalities.  Entangled particles share a combined quantum state, such that measurement of a property on one particle instantaneously influences the measurement outcome of the corresponding property on the other, even at vast distances.  This non-local correlation does not permit faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of a measurement on one particle remains random until measured. However, the correlation between outcomes is perfectly predictable. The theoretical framework relies on the superposition principle and the tensor product of Hilbert spaces, describing the entangled state as a linear combination of separable states.  Practical applications of entanglement are being explored in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation, leveraging its non-classical correlations for enhanced computational power and secure communication.  Further research into the fundamental nature of entanglement and its implications for our understanding of reality remains a crucial area of investigation.
