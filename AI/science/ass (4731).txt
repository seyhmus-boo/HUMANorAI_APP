Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the mechanisms of photosynthesis, a process fundamental to life on Earth.  Early understanding, dating back to the 17th century with Jan van Helmont's willow tree experiment, incorrectly attributed plant growth solely to water uptake.  However, subsequent research, notably by Joseph Priestley and Jan Ingenhousz in the 18th century, revealed the crucial roles of light and air, specifically oxygen release.  

The overall process can be summarized as the conversion of light energy into chemical energy in the form of glucose. This occurs in two main stages: the light-dependent reactions, taking place within the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, and the light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, occurring in the stroma.  In the light-dependent reactions, light energy excites chlorophyll, driving electron transport chains that generate ATP and NADPH.  These energy-carrying molecules then fuel the Calvin cycle, where carbon dioxide is fixed into organic molecules. This intricate interplay of light absorption, electron transfer, and enzymatic reactions sustains almost all life on Earth.  Further investigation will delve into the specific components and regulation of these stages.
