Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing unique electronic and mechanical properties, are best understood through a quantum mechanical framework.  Their structure, essentially rolled-up graphene sheets, dictates their electronic behaviour.  The chirality, defined by the chiral vector (n,m), determines whether a CNT is metallic or semiconducting.  Metallic CNTs exhibit linear dispersion relations near the Fermi level, a direct consequence of the band structure derived from tight-binding calculations considering π-electron interactions.  Semiconducting CNTs, on the other hand, display a band gap, the magnitude of which is inversely proportional to the diameter and dependent on chirality.  Quantum confinement effects significantly influence these properties, particularly in smaller diameter nanotubes, leading to enhanced energy quantization.  Furthermore, the strong sp² hybridization contributes to exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, explained by the high bonding energy and rigidity of the carbon network.  Computational methods like density functional theory (DFT) are crucial for accurate prediction of CNT properties, allowing the investigation of effects beyond simple models, including electron-phonon interactions and defects.  Understanding these quantum phenomena is pivotal for exploiting CNTs in advanced applications like nanoelectronics and composites.
