Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, a fundamental process underpinning life's continuity.  Early understanding of heredity predated knowledge of DNA's structure, with Mendel's work laying the groundwork in the 19th century.  However, the elucidation of DNA's double helix by Watson and Crick in 1953 revolutionized the field.  Their model inherently suggested a mechanism for replication: the semi-conservative model.

This model, subsequently proven experimentally by Meselson and Stahl, posits that each strand of the parental DNA serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.  The process initiates at specific origins of replication, where the DNA unwinds with the aid of helicases.  DNA polymerases then synthesize new strands, adding nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to the formation of two identical DNA molecules, each consisting of one parental and one newly synthesized strand. This precise duplication ensures faithful transmission of genetic information during cell division, a cornerstone of biological inheritance.  We'll delve further into the enzymatic machinery and complexities of this process in subsequent lectures.
