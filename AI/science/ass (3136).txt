Black hole formation is a dramatic astrophysical process culminating from the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars.  Imagine a massive star, far exceeding our Sun's mass, as a colossal balloon filled with intensely hot, pressurized gas undergoing nuclear fusion.  This fusion, the star's energy source, combats the inward pull of gravity. However, when the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, this outward pressure diminishes.  This is analogous to slowly letting the air out of the balloon; the internal pressure can no longer support the balloon's structure.  The star's core, no longer supported by fusion, succumbs to its immense self-gravity, undergoing a catastrophic implosion.  This collapse is not merely a shrinking; it's a relentless compression beyond the limits of atomic structure.  Electrons are forced into protons, forming neutrons, creating a neutron star.  However, if the initial stellar mass surpasses a critical threshold (around 20-30 solar masses), even the neutron degeneracy pressure cannot resist the crushing gravity. The collapse continues unabated, eventually forming a singularity, a point of infinite density, surrounded by an event horizonâ€”the point of no return, akin to a one-way membrane from which not even light can escape.  This singularity, hidden within the event horizon, constitutes the black hole.
