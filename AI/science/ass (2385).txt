Black hole formation remains a cornerstone of astrophysical research, despite decades of study. This presentation will review the established pathways – stellar collapse and galactic mergers – highlighting recent advancements in our understanding of each.  Significant progress has been made in numerical relativity simulations, enabling more accurate modeling of stellar core collapse, including the crucial role of rotation and magnetic fields in determining black hole properties and the associated gravitational wave emission.  These simulations are now incorporating more sophisticated equations of state, leading to improved predictions of black hole masses and spins.  Furthermore, the era of multi-messenger astronomy, combining gravitational wave detections from LIGO/Virgo with electromagnetic observations, provides unprecedented insights into the aftermath of binary black hole mergers, shedding light on the progenitor systems and the surrounding environment.  Specifically, we will discuss recent observations that have challenged established models regarding the mass gap between neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes and the implications for binary black hole formation channels. Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon ongoing investigations into the formation of supermassive black holes, focusing on the challenges in explaining their rapid growth in the early universe.
