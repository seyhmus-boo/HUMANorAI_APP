Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, sparking significant interdisciplinary research.  This presentation will explore the key properties of CNTs, highlighting their relevance across diverse fields.  We will examine their remarkable tensile strength and Young's modulus, surpassing those of steel, crucial for advanced materials science applications in composites and nanoelectronics. Their unique electronic structure, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, enables applications in transistors, sensors, and energy storage devices.  Furthermore, the high thermal conductivity of CNTs offers potential for thermal management solutions in microelectronics and aerospace engineering.

The interdisciplinary nature of CNT research is emphasized by exploring their biocompatibility and toxicity.  Their potential for biomedical applications, such as drug delivery and tissue engineering, necessitates thorough investigation of their interactions with biological systems.  Finally, we will address challenges in scalable and cost-effective production of high-quality CNTs, essential for their widespread technological implementation.  This presentation aims to provide a concise overview of the remarkable properties of CNTs and their bridging role across materials science, engineering, physics, chemistry, and biology.
