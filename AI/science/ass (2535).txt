Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on black hole formation.  These enigmatic objects arise from the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars.  When a star, exceeding approximately three times the mass of our Sun, exhausts its nuclear fuel, the outward pressure counteracting gravity fails.  The core implodes catastrophically, ultimately reaching a singularity – a point of infinite density.  This implosion isn't instantaneous; it involves complex processes like neutron star formation, which can temporarily resist the collapse, before succumbing to gravity's relentless pull.

The surrounding stellar material either falls into the singularity or is ejected in a spectacular supernova explosion.  The resulting black hole possesses immense gravitational pull, warping spacetime and defining an event horizon beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

While the direct observation of black holes remains challenging, their existence is inferred through indirect methods such as gravitational lensing and the detection of gravitational waves produced by binary black hole mergers. These mergers, predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity, are instrumental in advancing our understanding of gravitational physics.  Furthermore, observations of black holes inform models of galaxy formation and evolution, offering insights into the large-scale structure of the universe.  The study of black holes, therefore, has profound implications for astrophysics and fundamental physics.
