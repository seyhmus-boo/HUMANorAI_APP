Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties driving extensive research and development.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds, results in high tensile strength and Young's modulus, far exceeding those of steel.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable electrical conductivity, demonstrating metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality, enabling applications in electronics and sensors.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to exceptional thermal conductivity along the tube axis, making them promising for thermal management applications.

Recent advancements focus on precisely controlling CNT synthesis to achieve desired chirality and length distributions, crucial for optimizing specific properties.  Techniques such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with advanced catalysts and growth substrates are yielding higher purity and more uniform CNT arrays.  Furthermore, research into functionalization strategies, including covalent and non-covalent modifications, is enhancing CNT dispersibility in various solvents and matrices, facilitating their integration into composite materials.  The development of scalable and cost-effective production methods remains a key challenge, but ongoing progress promises wider adoption across diverse technological fields.
