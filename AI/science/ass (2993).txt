Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, constitutes a significant energy release mechanism.  This process is typically initiated by neutron bombardment, wherein the absorption of a neutron by a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, leads to an unstable, highly energetic intermediate state. This intermediate subsequently undergoes fission, releasing a substantial amount of kinetic energy manifested as the rapid movement of the fission fragments.  Concurrently, several neutrons are emitted, crucial for the possibility of a chain reaction.  The energy yield per fission event is considerable, predominantly stemming from the strong nuclear force overcoming the Coulomb repulsion between protons within the fragment nuclei.  The exact nature of the fission products is stochastic, resulting in a wide range of isotopes with varying radioactive decay characteristics, necessitating careful consideration of nuclear waste management.  The average number of neutrons released per fission, denoted as Î½, significantly influences the criticality of a fission reactor, determining whether the chain reaction is self-sustaining or subcritical.  Variations in this parameter, influenced by factors such as neutron energy and fissile material composition, are crucial to reactor control and safety.
