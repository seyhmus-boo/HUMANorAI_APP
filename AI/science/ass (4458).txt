DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning life, remains a subject of intense investigation.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of the core mechanisms of DNA replication, focusing on the intricate interplay of enzymes such as DNA polymerases, helicases, and primases.  We will explore the challenges posed by replication fork stalling and the cellular responses to these impediments, including the roles of translesion synthesis polymerases and homologous recombination pathways.

Recent advances in single-molecule techniques have revolutionized our understanding of replication dynamics.  High-resolution imaging and force spectroscopy have revealed unprecedented detail about the physical forces involved and the spatiotemporal organization of the replisome.  Furthermore, advancements in CRISPR-Cas9 technology have enabled precise manipulation of replication origins and components, allowing for targeted investigation of specific regulatory mechanisms.  Finally,  the implications of these discoveries for understanding genomic instability and its contribution to disease, including cancer, will be discussed.  The presentation will conclude by highlighting promising avenues for future research, including the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting replication vulnerabilities.
