Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon arising from the principles of quantum mechanics, describes a situation where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that they exhibit correlated behavior, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation transcends classical physics; measuring the state of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, even across vast distances. This non-local correlation, famously highlighted by Einstein's "spooky action at a distance," is a consequence of the superposition principle and the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum states.  The entangled particles share a combined quantum state, and individual particle states are only defined upon measurement, collapsing the wave function for the entire entangled system.  This fundamental characteristic has far-reaching implications.  Practical applications are actively being explored, most notably in quantum computing, where entanglement forms the basis for powerful algorithms surpassing classical capabilities.  Entanglement is also crucial for quantum cryptography, enabling secure communication channels impervious to eavesdropping, and is being investigated for its potential in quantum teleportation, facilitating the transfer of quantum information across distances.  Further research into entanglement holds immense promise for advancements across diverse fields, from materials science to precision measurement.
