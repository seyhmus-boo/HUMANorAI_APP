Black hole formation remains a central challenge in astrophysics, despite considerable theoretical progress.  While stellar-mass black holes are predicted to form via the gravitational collapse of massive stars, directly observing this process is hampered by the obscuring effects of dust and gas, as well as the immense timescales involved.  Gravitational wave astronomy offers a promising avenue, providing indirect evidence through the detection of mergers; however,  the precise pre-merger evolution and the characterization of the progenitor stars remain difficult to ascertain.  Supermassive black hole formation presents even greater difficulties, with competing models proposing direct collapse, runaway mergers, or growth from seed black holes.  Observational constraints are limited by the extreme distances and the challenges of resolving the central regions of active galactic nuclei.  Furthermore, accurately modelling the complex interplay of gas dynamics, magnetic fields, and radiative transfer in these high-density environments remains computationally expensive and fraught with uncertainties.  Future advancements rely on improved observational techniques, including next-generation telescopes capable of resolving finer details, and on the development of sophisticated numerical simulations incorporating more realistic physics. Bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and observational evidence requires a multi-faceted approach, encompassing multi-messenger astronomy and advanced computational modelling.
