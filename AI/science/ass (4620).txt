Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding a synergistic approach involving theoretical physics, observational astronomy, and computational astrophysics. This presentation explores the diverse pathways to black hole creation, emphasizing the interplay between these fields. We will review the classical collapse of massive stars, focusing on the role of stellar evolution models and their limitations in accurately predicting the final fate of stars.  Furthermore, we will examine the formation of intermediate-mass black holes, a less understood process potentially involving runaway stellar collisions within dense clusters, highlighting the crucial role of numerical simulations in understanding this complex dynamical environment.  The discussion will then extend to supermassive black holes residing at galactic centres, exploring the competing theories of direct collapse and hierarchical merging, showcasing how observations from multi-wavelength astronomy, including gravitational wave detection, inform and constrain these models.  Finally, we will briefly address open questions and future research directions, emphasizing the need for continued interdisciplinary collaboration to unravel the mysteries surrounding black hole genesis across all mass scales.
