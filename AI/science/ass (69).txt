Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical physics, wherein systems exhibit independent states.  Entangled particles, regardless of spatial separation, share a unified quantum state, such that measurement of one instantly influences the state of the others, a phenomenon seemingly violating locality.  This interconnectedness is formally represented by a joint wavefunction that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each constituent particle.  Violation of Bell's inequalities experimentally confirms the existence of entangled states, ruling out local hidden variable theories as explanations for quantum correlations.  The strength of entanglement is quantified through measures like concurrence or entanglement entropy, providing tools to assess the degree of non-classical correlation.  Understanding and harnessing quantum entanglement is crucial for advancements in quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation, exploiting the non-classical correlations for novel technological applications.  Ongoing research focuses on generating, manipulating, and preserving entanglement in increasingly complex systems, paving the way for the development of practical quantum technologies.
