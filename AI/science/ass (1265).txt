This presentation explores the fundamental concepts of chemical bonding and molecular structure, tracing their historical development and highlighting their contemporary significance.  Early atomic theories, such as Dalton's postulates, provided a foundational understanding of matter's composition, but lacked an explanation for the forces holding atoms together.  The subsequent development of quantum mechanics revolutionized our understanding, leading to the formulation of valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory.  We will examine these theories, contrasting their strengths and limitations in describing diverse bonding types, including covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds.

The presentation will delve into the crucial relationship between molecular structure and chemical properties.  Geometric parameters such as bond length, bond angle, and dihedral angle, determined experimentally via techniques like X-ray crystallography and spectroscopy, are directly linked to a molecule's reactivity, physical state, and biological function.  We will illustrate how understanding molecular geometry, including concepts like hybridization and resonance, is crucial for predicting chemical behavior and designing novel materials.  Finally, we will briefly discuss advanced computational methods used to model and predict molecular structures and properties, emphasizing the ongoing interplay between theoretical and experimental approaches in this ever-evolving field.
