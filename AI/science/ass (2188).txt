Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them attractive for a wide range of applications.  Their high aspect ratio and spÂ²-bonded carbon lattice contribute to tensile strengths exceeding those of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility.  Electrical conductivity varies significantly depending on chirality, with some exhibiting metallic behavior and others semiconducting properties, offering tunability for electronic device applications.  High thermal conductivity, exceeding that of diamond in some configurations, makes them promising for thermal management solutions.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT synthesis to achieve precise chirality and length distributions, as well as addressing issues related to dispersion and functionalization for effective integration into composite materials and devices.  This review summarizes the key properties of CNTs, highlighting their potential and the ongoing research aimed at overcoming limitations for realizing their full technological potential in diverse fields, including electronics, composites, energy storage, and biomedical applications.  Further research focusing on scalable, controlled synthesis and improved processing techniques is crucial for widespread adoption.
