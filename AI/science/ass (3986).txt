The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting such intense gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical groundwork, stemming from John Michell's and Pierre-Simon Laplace's 18th-century speculations on "dark stars," posited the existence of objects with gravitational pull strong enough to prevent light from escaping.  However, a rigorous theoretical framework emerged only with Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the early 20th century, which provided the mathematical description necessary to understand the extreme gravitational collapse leading to black hole formation.  This collapse is primarily understood to occur at the end of the life cycle of massive stars (typically exceeding 20 solar masses).  Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel, the immense gravitational pressure overwhelms the outward pressure of degeneracy, resulting in a catastrophic implosion.  If the stellar remnant's mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, no known force can prevent further collapse, ultimately leading to the formation of a singularity at the center, shrouded by an event horizon marking the point of no return.  While the exact details of the collapse process remain an active area of research, simulations and observations strongly support the stellar-mass black hole formation pathway as the primary mechanism for their creation.  Alternative formation pathways, such as those involving the direct collapse of massive gas clouds, are also being explored.
