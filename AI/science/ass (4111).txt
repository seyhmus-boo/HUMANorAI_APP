Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit a remarkable array of properties that underpin their diverse applications across multiple scientific disciplines.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from the strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds in their hexagonal lattice structure, is crucial in materials science for developing high-strength composites and nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS).  This strength is complemented by exceptional flexibility, enabling their use in flexible electronics and biomedical devices.  Furthermore, CNTs possess unique electrical properties, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality and diameter, a feature exploited in electronics and sensor technology.  Their high aspect ratio and large surface area, central to their utility in catalysis and energy storage, also facilitate significant advancements in chemistry and chemical engineering, for example, in developing high-capacity batteries and efficient catalysts.  Finally, the biocompatibility of certain CNT functionalizations opens avenues in biomedicine, including drug delivery and biosensing, bridging the gap between materials science and biological applications.  Understanding these diverse properties across various fields is essential for realizing the full potential of CNTs in numerous technological advancements.
