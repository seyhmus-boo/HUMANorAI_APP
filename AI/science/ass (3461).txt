Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on chemical bonding and molecular structure, a cornerstone of modern chemistry.  Early attempts to understand matter, notably Dalton's atomic theory, laid the groundwork, but it was the subsequent development of quantum mechanics that revolutionised our understanding.  We now know that chemical bonds arise from the electrostatic interactions between atoms, primarily involving the valence electrons. These interactions minimize the overall energy of the system, leading to stable molecular structures.  

The primary bond types, covalent and ionic, represent extremes of electron sharing and electron transfer respectively, with polar covalent bonds existing on a spectrum between these.  The arrangement of atoms within a molecule, its structure, is dictated by these bonds, along with factors such as electron-pair repulsion and hybridisation.  Understanding molecular structure is paramount as it dictates a molecule's physical and chemical properties, influencing reactivity, polarity, and ultimately, its function in biological and industrial contexts.  We will explore these concepts in greater detail throughout this course.
