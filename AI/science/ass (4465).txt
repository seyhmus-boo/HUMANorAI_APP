DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating the genome, remains a central focus in molecular biology.  The core mechanism, involving unwinding by helicases, primer synthesis by primases, leading and lagging strand synthesis by DNA polymerases, and ligation by ligases, is well-established. However, recent research has refined our understanding of several aspects.  High-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled detailed analysis of replication timing and origin usage across diverse genomes, revealing complex regulatory networks and their implications for genome stability.  Studies exploring the roles of accessory proteins, like chromatin remodelers and single-stranded DNA-binding proteins, have illuminated their crucial contribution to replication fork progression and stability, particularly in resolving challenging genomic regions.  Furthermore, advances in cryo-electron microscopy have provided unprecedented structural insights into the replisome, a multi-protein complex orchestrating replication, revealing dynamic interactions between its components.  Finally, research into the mechanisms of replication stress response and its connection to aging and disease continues to unveil novel therapeutic targets for cancer and other age-related disorders.  These developments underscore the ongoing evolution of our comprehension of this fundamental biological process.
