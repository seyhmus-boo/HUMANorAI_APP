Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic chemistry, enabling efficient and selective transformations that would be otherwise unattainable under conventional conditions. This presentation will provide an overview of the diverse roles catalysts play in organic synthesis, highlighting key mechanistic principles and emerging trends.  We will explore the application of various catalyst classes, including homogeneous metal catalysts (e.g., palladium, rhodium), heterogeneous catalysts (e.g., zeolites, metal oxides), and biocatalysts (e.g., enzymes).  Specific examples will illustrate the impact of catalyst design on reaction selectivity, yield, and sustainability.  The discussion will also encompass practical applications, focusing on the significant contributions of catalysis to the production of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials science.  For instance, asymmetric catalysis is crucial for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure drugs, while cross-coupling reactions facilitated by palladium catalysts are vital in the preparation of complex molecules.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon current research directions, including the development of more sustainable and environmentally benign catalytic systems, and the integration of artificial intelligence in catalyst design.
