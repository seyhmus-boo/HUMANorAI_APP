This presentation explores the intricacies of nuclear fission processes through the lens of quantum mechanics.  While classical physics provides a framework for understanding the macroscopic behavior of fission, a complete description necessitates a quantum mechanical approach. We will delve into the crucial role of quantum tunneling in overcoming the Coulomb barrier, enabling the fission process to initiate even with seemingly insufficient kinetic energy. The presentation will highlight the importance of nuclear shell structure and its influence on fission fragment yields, emphasizing the quantum nature of nuclear energy levels and their impact on the stability of the resulting nuclei.  Furthermore, we will discuss the limitations of current theoretical models and the ongoing challenges in accurately predicting fission fragment distributions and neutron emission probabilities.  Specifically, the complexities arising from the many-body problem and the need for sophisticated computational methods will be addressed.  The presentation will conclude by briefly examining the potential for advancements in quantum computing to refine our understanding and predictive capabilities in this vital area of nuclear physics.
