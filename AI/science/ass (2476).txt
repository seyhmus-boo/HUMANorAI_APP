Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on catalysts in organic chemistry.  Catalysts, in essence, are the unsung heroes of chemical reactions.  Think of them as matchmakers, facilitating a union between reactants that would otherwise proceed too slowly or not at all.  They achieve this without being consumed themselves in the process â€“ much like a wedding officiant, who plays a vital role but doesn't become part of the married couple.

Catalysts achieve this by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy.  Imagine a mountain pass between two valleys representing reactants and products.  The uncatalysed reaction is a high, arduous climb.  The catalyst, however, creates a lower, more accessible tunnel through the mountain, allowing the reaction to proceed more readily.

This lower energy pathway is typically achieved through the formation of intermediate complexes between the catalyst and reactants.  These complexes then decompose, regenerating the catalyst and releasing the desired products. The specific mechanism by which this occurs varies greatly depending on the catalyst and the reaction, encompassing acid-base catalysis, organometallic catalysis, and enzymatic catalysis, to name but a few.  Understanding these mechanisms is crucial to designing efficient and selective synthetic routes.
