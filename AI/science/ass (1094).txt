Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns catalysts in organic chemistry.  Catalysts are substances that accelerate the rate of a chemical reaction without being consumed themselves.  Think of them as matchmakers in the world of molecules.  They facilitate interactions between reactants, lowering the activation energy – the energetic hurdle preventing reaction – much like a match reduces the energy required to ignite a fire.

Unlike stoichiometric reagents, catalysts are present in far smaller quantities and are regenerated at the end of the reaction.  Imagine a tireless postman delivering letters (reactants) between two houses (products). The postman (catalyst) is crucial for efficient delivery, but he remains unchanged after delivering countless letters.

Catalysts achieve this acceleration through various mechanisms. They can, for example, bind reactants and orient them favourably for reaction, analogous to a skilled carpenter expertly aligning pieces of wood before joining them.  Or, they might temporarily form intermediates, lowering the energy barrier to the transition state – a shortcut on the mountainous path to product formation.  Understanding catalyst function is central to optimising numerous industrial processes and developing new synthetic routes in organic chemistry.
