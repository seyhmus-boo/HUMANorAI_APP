Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on black hole formation, a fascinating area of ongoing research in astrophysics.  The primary mechanism, stellar collapse, occurs when a massive star, at least eight times the mass of our Sun, exhausts its nuclear fuel.  The ensuing gravitational collapse overcomes degeneracy pressure, resulting in a singularity – a point of infinite density – at the core.  This forms a black hole, defined by its event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

Recent developments refine our understanding of this process. Gravitational wave astronomy, through detections by LIGO and Virgo, provides direct observational evidence of binary black hole mergers, confirming theoretical predictions and offering insights into their formation and evolution within dense stellar environments.  Furthermore, advancements in numerical relativity simulations allow for increasingly accurate modelling of the complex physics involved in collapse, particularly regarding the effects of rotation and magnetic fields on the final black hole properties. These computational advances, combined with increasingly precise observational data, are continuously refining our knowledge of black hole formation and their diverse populations across the universe.
