Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms.  Their discovery spurred intense research due to their predicted and subsequently demonstrated superior mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  Mechanically, CNTs exhibit exceptional tensile strength and Young's modulus, surpassing those of steel.  Electrically, their behaviour is strongly dependent on chirality, with some displaying metallic conductivity and others semiconducting properties, offering potential for advanced electronics.  Thermally, CNTs demonstrate high thermal conductivity, making them attractive for thermal management applications.

However,  their practical application faces challenges.  Precise control over chirality during synthesis remains a hurdle, impacting the reproducibility of desired electrical properties.  Furthermore, challenges exist in their processing and integration into larger-scale devices, as well as in addressing potential toxicity concerns. Despite these limitations, the remarkable properties of CNTs continue to drive significant research efforts, promising breakthroughs in diverse fields including composites, energy storage, and biomedical engineering.
