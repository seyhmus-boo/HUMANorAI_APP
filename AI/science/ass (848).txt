The formation of black holes, while classically understood through gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, necessitates a quantum mechanical perspective to address the singularity at its core and the information paradox.  Gravitational collapse, governed by general relativity on macroscopic scales, ultimately leads to densities exceeding the Planck scale where quantum effects become dominant.  The precise mechanism remains an open problem, but prevailing theories suggest that quantum fluctuations in the early universe may have seeded the formation of primordial black holes, possibly contributing to dark matter.  Furthermore, quantum field theory in curved spacetime predicts Hawking radiation, a thermal emission originating from the event horizon. This process, while exceedingly slow for stellar-mass black holes, implies a gradual evaporation and ultimately the resolution of the singularity, although the specific information preservation mechanism remains unresolved.  The nature of spacetime at the Planck scale, potentially involving quantum geometries like loop quantum gravity or string theory, is critical to a complete understanding. These theories propose modifications to general relativity at high densities, potentially avoiding the formation of a true singularity and replacing it with a more complex quantum structure.  Ultimately, a unified theory of quantum gravity is required to fully elucidate black hole formation and evolution.
