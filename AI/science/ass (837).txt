Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic synthesis, enabling efficient and selective transformations that would otherwise be impractical. This presentation will provide an overview of recent advancements in catalyst design and application within organic chemistry.  We will focus on several key areas, including the burgeoning field of single-site heterogeneous catalysts, which offer improved recyclability and stability compared to their homogeneous counterparts.  Advances in the development of photoredox catalysts, capable of mediating challenging redox reactions under mild conditions, will also be discussed, highlighting their impact on sustainable synthesis.  Furthermore, the presentation will explore the increasing sophistication of biocatalysis, showcasing the use of engineered enzymes and whole-cell systems for enantioselective and regioselective transformations.  Finally, we will briefly examine the emerging area of organocatalysis, focusing on novel catalyst designs that exhibit enhanced reactivity and selectivity.  This overview aims to highlight the continued evolution of catalytic methodologies, emphasizing their crucial role in addressing contemporary challenges in the synthesis of complex molecules and the development of environmentally benign processes.
