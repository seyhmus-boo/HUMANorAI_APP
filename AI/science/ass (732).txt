Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter fragments, is fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles.  The process initiates when a neutron interacts with the target nucleus, increasing its energy and distorting the nuclear potential well. This distortion, described by the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation, weakens the strong nuclear force holding the nucleus together.  Tunneling, a purely quantum phenomenon, allows the nucleus to overcome the Coulomb barrier, a classical energy hurdle preventing proton repulsion.

The subsequent fission process is probabilistic, with various decay pathways possible depending on the excited state of the compound nucleus.  The wavefunction describing the system collapses into one of several final states representing the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  The specific fragment mass distribution, a key experimental observable, is directly linked to the probability density of the different possible wavefunction collapses, reflecting the complex interplay of nuclear forces and shell effects. The release of energy during fission originates from the binding energy difference between the initial heavy nucleus and the resultant lighter fragments, a consequence of the quantum nature of the strong nuclear force.  Furthermore, the emission of prompt neutrons is governed by the probability of nucleons overcoming the nuclear potential barrier, another manifestation of quantum tunneling.
