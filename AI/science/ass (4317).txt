Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the interplay of the strong nuclear force, which binds nucleons together, and the Coulombic repulsion between protons.  In heavy nuclei, the Coulombic repulsion becomes increasingly significant, destabilizing the system.  Quantum tunneling plays a crucial role, allowing the nucleus to overcome the potential energy barrier separating the initial state from the fission fragments even when the kinetic energy is insufficient classically.  This tunneling probability is described by the penetrability of the potential barrier, a function of the barrier height and width, both of which are determined by the nuclear potential and the specific nuclear configurations involved.  The subsequent decay into fission fragments is further governed by quantum mechanical principles, with the fragments' energy and angular momentum distributions reflecting the underlying nuclear wavefunctions and their interactions.  Furthermore, the emission of neutrons, a characteristic feature of many fission reactions, arises from the statistical distribution of nucleons' energy levels in the excited fission fragments, a direct consequence of the quantum mechanical nature of nuclear energy states.  Detailed calculations involving sophisticated nuclear models, incorporating both single-particle and collective aspects of nuclear dynamics, are necessary to accurately predict fission yields and fragment distributions.
