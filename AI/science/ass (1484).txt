Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition.  Entanglement describes a correlation between two or more quantum particles, irrespective of the spatial separation.  Measurements performed on one entangled particle instantaneously influence the state of others, regardless of distance. This apparent violation of locality has profound implications.

Historically, understanding entanglement was hampered by experimental limitations. However, recent developments in quantum technology have significantly advanced our capabilities.  Advances in high-fidelity quantum state preparation and manipulation, particularly with trapped ions and superconducting circuits, allow for the creation and characterization of increasingly complex entangled states.  Furthermore, the development of quantum networks, leveraging entanglement distribution via optical fibres or free-space links, opens pathways for distributed quantum computing and secure communication protocols.  Ongoing research investigates the potential of entanglement for quantum metrology, surpassing classical limits in precision measurements.  While much remains to be explored, the current trajectory points towards a future where harnessing entanglement becomes commonplace in advanced technological applications.
