Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, have garnered significant attention since their discovery in 1991.  Their unique structure, characterized by spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, underpins their remarkable characteristics. This paper explores the fundamental properties of CNTs, focusing on recent advancements in understanding and manipulating these materials.  Initial research primarily concentrated on establishing the relationship between structural parameters (diameter, chirality) and macroscopic properties, but recent studies have moved beyond this, delving into more sophisticated applications.  Significant progress has been made in controlled synthesis, enabling the precise tailoring of CNT properties for specific applications.  Furthermore, advanced characterization techniques, such as advanced microscopy and spectroscopy, have provided unprecedented insights into the complex structure-property relationships at the nanoscale. This review will examine the latest developments in the controlled growth of CNTs with specific chiralities, advancements in functionalization strategies for enhancing their dispersibility and reactivity, and emerging applications in fields such as electronics, composites, and energy storage, highlighting the ongoing challenges and future prospects in this rapidly evolving field.
