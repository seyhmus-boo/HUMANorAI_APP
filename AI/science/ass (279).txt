Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties that bridge multiple scientific disciplines.  Their unique combination of high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity (depending on chirality), and high thermal conductivity makes them promising candidates for diverse applications.  The strong mechanical properties, stemming from the spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms and strong covalent bonding, are exploited in materials science for reinforced composites and nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS).  Furthermore, their electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting, are investigated extensively in nanoelectronics, with potential for high-performance transistors and sensors.  Their high surface area and tunable surface chemistry are crucial in chemical engineering, enabling applications in catalysis, energy storage (e.g., batteries and supercapacitors), and drug delivery.  However, challenges remain, including efficient scalable production, precise control over chirality and dispersion in matrices, and biocompatibility concerns. Interdisciplinary research combining materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering is crucial for overcoming these challenges and realizing the full potential of CNTs across various technological domains.
