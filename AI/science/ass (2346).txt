The understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure, central to modern chemistry, evolved significantly throughout the 20th century.  Early attempts, such as the valence bond theory developed in the 1920s and 1930s, explained bonding through the overlap of atomic orbitals, leading to the formation of covalent bonds.  This theory, while successful in explaining many simple molecules, struggled to account for the properties of molecules with delocalized electrons.  Consequently, molecular orbital theory, emerging concurrently and gaining prominence later, provided a more comprehensive framework.  It describes bonding in terms of the combination of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals, encompassing both bonding and antibonding interactions.  This approach effectively explains phenomena such as resonance and aromaticity, which were difficult to reconcile with valence bond theory alone.  The development of sophisticated computational methods, like density functional theory (DFT), further enhanced our ability to predict and analyze molecular geometries and bonding characteristics, moving beyond simple diatomic molecules to complex macromolecules and materials. This continuous refinement of theoretical models, complemented by advancements in experimental techniques such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, has provided an increasingly accurate and detailed picture of the relationship between chemical bonding and the three-dimensional structure of molecules.
