This presentation explores the formation of black holes from a quantum mechanical perspective, addressing limitations inherent in purely classical gravitational treatments.  While the classical picture describes gravitational collapse leading to a singularity, quantum effects are expected to play a crucial role at the Planck scale, near the event horizon.  We will examine the implications of Hawking radiation, detailing its role in information loss paradoxes and its potential influence on the final stages of black hole formation.  Specifically, we will discuss models attempting to resolve the singularity problem through quantum gravity approaches, such as loop quantum gravity and string theory, highlighting their predictions regarding the structure of the event horizon and the nature of spacetime at extremely high energy densities.  Furthermore, we will touch upon the potential role of quantum fluctuations in the initial stages of proto-stellar collapse, examining whether they could significantly alter the dynamics leading to black hole formation.  Finally, we will briefly consider the open questions surrounding the nature of quantum black holes and their observational implications, emphasizing the need for further theoretical and observational investigations.
