Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  The prevalent mechanism is stellar collapse.  Massive stars, exceeding approximately eight solar masses, exhaust their nuclear fuel, culminating in core collapse.  Gravitational forces overwhelm the degeneracy pressure, leading to an inexorable inward collapse, ultimately forming a singularity â€“ a point of infinite density.

Recent developments refine our understanding of this process.  Advanced numerical simulations, incorporating improved equations of state and magnetohydrodynamic effects, provide increasingly detailed insights into the dynamics of collapse and the subsequent jet formation often observed in gamma-ray bursts, strongly linked to some black hole births.  Furthermore, gravitational wave astronomy, pioneered by LIGO and Virgo, directly detects the mergers of stellar-mass black holes, providing observational confirmation of theoretical models and offering valuable data on their masses and spins.  These observations, coupled with continued advancements in theoretical modelling, promise a richer and more precise understanding of black hole formation in the coming years.
