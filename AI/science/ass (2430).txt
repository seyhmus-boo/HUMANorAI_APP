Nuclear fission, the splitting of an atomic nucleus into two or more smaller nuclei, represents a pivotal scientific discovery with profound implications for energy production, weaponry, and scientific understanding.  Its historical trajectory began with the theoretical work of physicists like Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, culminating in the experimental demonstration of uranium fission by Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938. This groundbreaking achievement, initially interpreted with Meitner's crucial theoretical contributions, unveiled an unprecedented release of energy, far exceeding that of any previously known chemical reaction.  The subsequent realization of the chain reaction potential, largely fueled by the efforts of scientists like Enrico Fermi, initiated the Manhattan Project and ushered in the atomic age.  This paper will delve into the fundamental mechanisms of nuclear fission, exploring the various processes involved, including spontaneous fission, induced fission, and the crucial role of neutron interactions. We will further analyze the factors influencing fission yield and energy release, considering both the impact of projectile energy and target nucleus properties.  Finally, the paper will discuss the ongoing relevance of nuclear fission in contemporary energy production and its future prospects within a broader context of sustainable energy solutions.
