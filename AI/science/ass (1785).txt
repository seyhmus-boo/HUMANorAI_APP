Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, necessitates an interdisciplinary approach integrating stellar evolution, general relativity, and nuclear physics.  Massive stars, exceeding approximately 8 solar masses, exhaust their nuclear fuel, culminating in core collapse.  The interplay of gravity and the intense pressure of degenerate matter within the core becomes critical.  If the core mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 solar masses), further collapse ensues, leading to the formation of a neutron star. However, exceeding the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (~2-3 solar masses), even neutron degeneracy pressure fails to counteract gravity, resulting in the formation of a black hole.  

This process necessitates a sophisticated understanding of nuclear reactions within the stellar core, determining the final mass and composition prior to collapse.  Furthermore, general relativity dictates the spacetime curvature around the resulting singularity, influencing the accretion disk dynamics and the emission of gravitational wavesâ€”a phenomenon directly observable through interdisciplinary collaborations involving gravitational wave astronomy and theoretical modelling.  Understanding black hole formation thus requires a robust framework encompassing diverse physical phenomena across multiple disciplines.
