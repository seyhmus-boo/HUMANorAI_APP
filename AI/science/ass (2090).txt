Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon predicted by early quantum mechanics and experimentally verified in subsequent decades, describes a strong correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical physics, where independent systems possess separable states.  Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen famously argued that entanglement implied incompleteness in quantum mechanics, highlighting the "spooky action at a distance" inherent in correlated systems.  Bell's theorem, formulated in the 1960s, provided a crucial framework for experimentally testing the predictions of quantum mechanics against local realism, leading to numerous experiments conclusively demonstrating the violation of Bell inequalities.  These experiments confirmed the existence of entanglement and its non-classical nature.  Entanglement now serves as a fundamental resource in burgeoning fields such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography, where it enables the creation of entangled qubits for powerful computational tasks and secure communication protocols.  Further research focuses on exploring the limits of entanglement, its robustness against decoherence, and its potential for developing novel quantum technologies.
