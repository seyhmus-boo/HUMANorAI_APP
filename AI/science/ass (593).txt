Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the mechanisms of photosynthesis, the remarkable process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy.  Think of photosynthesis as a sophisticated two-stage factory.  The first, the light-dependent reactions, are like the power generation plant.  Here, sunlight, the raw material, is absorbed by chlorophyll, acting as solar panels, exciting electrons. This energy is then used to split water molecules, analogous to a hydroelectric dam harnessing water's potential energy, generating ATP and NADPH – the factory's energy currency.

The second stage, the light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, represents the assembly line.  Using the ATP and NADPH generated in the first stage, the factory, using carbon dioxide as a raw material, constructs glucose, a sugar molecule – the finished product –  through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  This process is remarkably efficient,  transforming atmospheric carbon dioxide into the very foundation of most food webs.  Understanding these two interconnected stages is crucial to grasping the fundamental process of life on Earth.
