Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, is a complex process underpinned by the interplay of strong and electromagnetic forces.  This paper summarizes the key mechanisms driving fission, focusing on the role of nuclear deformation and the resulting potential energy landscape.  The process is initiated by neutron absorption, leading to an excited compound nucleus that subsequently undergoes deformation through a series of collective vibrational and rotational modes.  This deformation ultimately leads to the formation of a scission configuration, characterized by a neck rupture and the separation of fission fragments.  The energy release, primarily stemming from the mass defect between the initial nucleus and the fragments, is distributed between kinetic energy of the fragments, prompt neutron emission, and the excitation energy of the fragments.  Fission fragment yields follow characteristic distributions, exhibiting a strong dependence on the fissile nucleus and the incident neutron energy.  Furthermore, the prompt neutron multiplicity plays a crucial role in reactor criticality and the design of nuclear weapons.  Future research directions include a more refined understanding of pre-scission dynamics and the development of accurate theoretical models to predict fission fragment properties.
