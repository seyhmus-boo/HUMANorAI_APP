Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of carbon atoms.  Their discovery, serendipitously observed in the late 1980s by Sumio Iijima through transmission electron microscopy, marked a pivotal moment in nanotechnology.  

CNTs exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel at a significantly lower density. This high tensile strength stems from the strong sp² hybridized carbon bonds within their hexagonal lattice structure.  Their electrical properties are equally noteworthy, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality – the arrangement of the hexagonal carbon rings.  This tunability is crucial for potential applications in electronics. Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation, and remarkable chemical stability. These unique properties, combined with their high aspect ratio, position CNTs as promising materials for diverse applications, ranging from advanced composites and electronics to energy storage and biomedical devices.
