DNA replication, the fundamental process of duplicating genetic material, is crucial for cellular proliferation and heredity.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of this vital biological process, tracing its historical understanding from early conceptualizations to current molecular mechanistic detail.  We will begin by briefly exploring the historical context, highlighting the seminal experiments of Griffith, Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty, which implicated DNA as the hereditary material, and culminating in the elucidation of the double helix structure by Watson and Crick, providing a crucial framework for understanding replication.

The presentation will then delve into the molecular mechanisms of DNA replication, focusing on the key enzymes involved, including helicases, primases, DNA polymerases, and ligases.  We will discuss the semi-conservative nature of replication, the leading and lagging strands, and the importance of proofreading mechanisms in maintaining genomic integrity.  Furthermore, the presentation will touch upon the challenges presented by the replication of telomeres and the implications of replication errors in disease development.  Finally, we will briefly discuss current research focusing on manipulating DNA replication for therapeutic applications, such as targeted gene editing and cancer treatment.  This overview aims to provide a balanced and accessible understanding of DNA replication, from its historical roots to its contemporary significance.
