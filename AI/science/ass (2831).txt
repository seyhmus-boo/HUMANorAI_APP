The concept of chemical bonding, explaining the forces holding atoms together in molecules and solids, evolved significantly throughout the 20th century.  Early attempts, such as the valence bond theory proposed by G.N. Lewis, focused on the sharing of electron pairs to achieve stable octets, a cornerstone of understanding covalent bonds.  However, this model struggled to fully explain the geometry and properties of more complex molecules.  Subsequently, the development of molecular orbital (MO) theory provided a more sophisticated framework, describing bonding as the combination of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals encompassing the entire molecule.  This approach elegantly accounts for phenomena like resonance and delocalization, which are beyond the scope of simple valence bond theory.  The interplay between bonding theory and molecular structure is paramount; the arrangement of atoms within a molecule – its geometry – is a direct consequence of the nature and strength of the bonds formed.  Understanding bond angles, bond lengths, and the overall molecular shape is crucial for predicting reactivity, physical properties, and biological function.  Sophisticated techniques such as X-ray crystallography and spectroscopy are instrumental in determining these structural parameters, validating and refining our understanding of the fundamental forces driving chemical bonding.
