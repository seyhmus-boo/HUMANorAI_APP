Plasma physics phenomena, while classically described by macroscopic fluid equations, reveal a rich tapestry of behaviours deeply rooted in quantum mechanical principles.  The fundamental interaction governing plasma dynamics – the Coulomb interaction – is inherently quantum mechanical, exhibiting long-range effects that necessitate sophisticated treatment beyond classical approximations.  Quantum effects manifest most prominently at high densities and low temperatures, where quantum degeneracy pressure becomes significant and alters the plasma's equation of state.  For instance, the Pauli exclusion principle plays a crucial role in determining the behaviour of degenerate plasmas found in white dwarf stars, influencing their stability against gravitational collapse.  Furthermore, quantum fluctuations, especially those associated with virtual particle-antiparticle pair creation, affect plasma screening and collective oscillations.  The quantization of electromagnetic fields leads to phenomena such as stimulated emission and absorption, crucial in understanding laser-plasma interactions and the development of instabilities.  Finally, at sufficiently high energies, quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects, including vacuum polarization and radiative corrections, become non-negligible, requiring relativistic quantum field theory for accurate modelling of highly energetic plasmas, such as those found in astrophysical jets or within high-energy laser experiments.  Thus, a comprehensive understanding of plasma physics necessitates a careful consideration of its quantum mechanical underpinnings.
