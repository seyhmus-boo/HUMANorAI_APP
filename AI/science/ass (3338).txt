Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked regardless of spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics despite significant experimental hurdles.  While the theoretical framework is well-established, realizing and exploiting entanglement in practical applications presents considerable challenges.  Maintaining coherence, a crucial prerequisite for entanglement's preservation, is severely hampered by environmental noise and decoherence effects.  This necessitates sophisticated isolation techniques, often involving cryogenic environments and advanced shielding from electromagnetic interference, significantly increasing experimental complexity and cost.

Furthermore, generating and verifying entanglement reliably across multiple particles remains a significant technical obstacle.  Scaling up entanglement to larger systems, essential for quantum computing and communication, requires robust entanglement generation methods capable of overcoming limitations imposed by experimental imperfections and inherent particle-particle interactions.  Finally, accurate and efficient state tomography, the process of characterizing the entangled state, is resource-intensive and faces challenges associated with the high dimensionality of entangled states.  Overcoming these experimental limitations is crucial for transitioning entanglement from a fascinating quantum phenomenon to a powerful technological tool.
