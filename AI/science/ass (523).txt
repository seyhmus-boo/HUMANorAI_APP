Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, driving extensive research into their diverse applications.  Their remarkable tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, coupled with high elasticity, makes them attractive for reinforcement in composite materials.  Recent advancements focus on controlled synthesis techniques, enabling precise tailoring of CNT diameter, chirality, and length, thereby fine-tuning their properties.  For instance, the development of  catalytic chemical vapor deposition methods allows for large-scale production of high-quality, single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) with specific chirality distributions, crucial for electronic applications.  Furthermore, research into functionalization strategies, including covalent and non-covalent modifications, improves CNT dispersibility and facilitates integration into various matrices.  Progress in understanding the intricate relationship between CNT structure and properties, facilitated by advanced characterization techniques like advanced microscopy and spectroscopy, is paving the way for the development of novel devices, including high-performance transistors, sensors, and energy storage systems.  However, challenges remain regarding large-scale, cost-effective production and addressing potential health and environmental concerns associated with CNT handling.
