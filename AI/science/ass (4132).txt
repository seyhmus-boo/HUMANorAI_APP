Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on chemical bonding and its influence on molecular structure.  Essentially, atoms, like social magnets, seek stability. This stability is achieved through chemical bonding, the attractive forces holding atoms together in molecules.  Think of it like building with LEGOs: individual bricks (atoms) connect via specific attachments (bonds) to form elaborate structures (molecules).

We primarily encounter two major bonding types: ionic and covalent.  Ionic bonding resembles a power imbalance, where one atom (the "bully") forcefully takes an electron from a weaker atom, creating oppositely charged ions that attract electrostatically – like magnets sticking together due to opposite poles. Covalent bonding, conversely, is a cooperative venture; atoms share electrons to achieve a stable electron configuration, like two individuals sharing a resource to mutually benefit.  

The type of bonding dictates the molecule's structure – linear, bent, tetrahedral, etc. – influencing its physical and chemical properties.  Understanding these fundamental bonding principles provides the foundation for predicting and explaining the behaviours of countless substances we encounter daily.  We'll explore these structural variations in greater detail throughout this module.
