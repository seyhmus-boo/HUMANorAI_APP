Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, irrespective of spatial separation.  This non-classical correlation, established during an interaction, persists even when the systems are subsequently isolated.  Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the corresponding property of the other(s), regardless of distance, a seemingly paradoxical violation of local realism.  This non-local correlation is not due to pre-existing properties, but rather arises from the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.  The entangled state is described by a combined wavefunction, incapable of being factored into independent individual wavefunctions.  Entanglement has profound implications for quantum computing, enabling the creation of powerful quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols.  However, experimental verification and practical applications remain challenged by the fragility of entangled states and the difficulties in maintaining coherence over macroscopic distances.  Further research into the theoretical foundations and technological implementation of quantum entanglement is crucial for advancing quantum technologies.
