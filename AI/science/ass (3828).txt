Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of rolled-up graphene sheets, have captivated researchers since their discovery by Iijima in 1991.  This presentation will explore the remarkable properties of CNTs that underpin their vast potential across diverse technological applications.  Their unique sp² hybridized carbon structure gives rise to exceptional mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel while possessing significantly lower density.  This exceptional strength, coupled with high elasticity and flexibility, makes them ideal candidates for advanced composites and flexible electronics.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit extraordinary electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality – the angle and orientation of the graphene sheet's rolling.  This tunable conductivity is crucial for applications ranging from high-performance transistors to transparent conducting films.  Finally, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation in microelectronic devices and potentially enabling advanced thermal management systems.  This presentation will review the key structural and physical properties of CNTs, highlighting their synthesis methods and current challenges in scalable production and controlled functionalization towards realizing their full technological potential.  The ongoing research and future directions in this rapidly evolving field will also be briefly discussed.
