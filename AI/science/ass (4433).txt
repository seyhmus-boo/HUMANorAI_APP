Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile moduli exceeding that of steel, arises from the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheets forming their walls.  This strength, coupled with their exceptionally high aspect ratio, renders them attractive for reinforcement in composite materials.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable electrical conductivity, depending on their chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior. This tunable conductivity facilitates applications in electronics and sensors.  Their high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper, contributes to their use in thermal management systems.  However, challenges remain, including the control of chirality distribution during synthesis and the efficient dispersion of CNTs in matrices.  Further research focuses on exploring the intricate interplay between structure, chirality, and resultant properties to fully exploit their potential in diverse technological applications, encompassing energy storage, nanoelectronics, and biomedical devices.
