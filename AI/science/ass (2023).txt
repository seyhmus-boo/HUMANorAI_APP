Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This strong correlation implies that the entangled particles share a combined quantum state, such that measuring a property of one instantaneously influences the corresponding property of the others, even at distances exceeding light-travel time.  This non-local correlation has profound implications across multiple disciplines.

In physics, entanglement is crucial for quantum computing and cryptography, enabling the development of algorithms and secure communication protocols impossible with classical systems.  In computer science, the exploration of entanglement leads to advancements in quantum algorithm design and error correction.  Furthermore, entanglement's implications for the foundations of quantum mechanics continue to fuel philosophical debates regarding locality and realism.  Finally,  interdisciplinary research explores potential applications in biology, investigating the possibility of entanglement playing a role in biological processes, although concrete evidence remains scarce. The study of entanglement therefore bridges fundamental physics, computer science, and potentially even biological sciences, highlighting its central role in advancing scientific understanding.
