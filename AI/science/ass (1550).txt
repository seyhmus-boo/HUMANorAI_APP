Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, with recent advancements refining our understanding of the diverse pathways leading to these enigmatic objects.  Stellar-mass black holes, born from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, are increasingly well-characterized through gravitational wave observations from binary mergers, providing constraints on progenitor properties and the nature of the collapse itself. Numerical simulations incorporating sophisticated equations of state and magnetic fields are improving the accuracy of these models, revealing the importance of rotation and magnetic fields in the final stages of collapse.  Furthermore, the study of intermediate-mass black holes, bridging the gap between stellar and supermassive black holes, is gaining momentum.  Observations suggest potential formation mechanisms such as runaway stellar collisions in dense clusters or the direct collapse of massive gas clouds, although definitive evidence remains elusive.  The formation of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies presents another significant challenge.  While the favored scenario involves accretion of surrounding matter onto a seed black hole (either stellar-mass or from direct collapse), the efficiency and timescales of this process continue to be debated, with recent research exploring the roles of feedback mechanisms and galaxy mergers.  Ongoing multi-messenger astronomy, combining gravitational wave and electromagnetic data, promises further insights into black hole formation across the mass spectrum.
