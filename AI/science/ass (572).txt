Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have garnered significant research interest for diverse applications. This presentation will review the fundamental properties of CNTs, focusing on their remarkable strength and stiffness, stemming from the strong covalent bonds within their hexagonal lattice structure.  Their electrical properties are highly dependent on chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour, enabling potential applications in electronics and sensors.  The presentation will also address the thermal conductivity of CNTs, which surpasses that of many other materials, making them attractive for thermal management applications.  Furthermore, we will discuss the challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and functionalization, crucial for realizing their full potential.  Specific examples will highlight the use of CNTs in advanced composites, energy storage devices, and biomedical applications.  The presentation concludes by outlining future research directions focused on controlling CNT synthesis for improved properties and exploring novel applications leveraging their unique multi-faceted characteristics.
