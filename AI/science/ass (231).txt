Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, is a powerful energy-releasing process underpinned by the strong and weak nuclear forces.  Initiated by neutron bombardment, typically of uranium-235 or plutonium-239, fission releases a significant quantity of energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²), along with further neutrons capable of inducing chain reactions.  These chain reactions are controlled in nuclear reactors through moderators (e.g., graphite) which slow neutrons to increase fission probability, and control rods (e.g., cadmium) which absorb excess neutrons, preventing uncontrolled exponential growth.  The energy released manifests as heat, used to generate steam for electricity production in nuclear power plants – a significant, albeit controversial, source of baseload power globally.

Beyond electricity generation, fission finds applications in nuclear medicine, providing radioisotopes for diagnostics (e.g., technetium-99m for imaging) and radiotherapy (e.g., cobalt-60 for cancer treatment).  Furthermore,  fission plays a crucial role in the production of nuclear weapons, though its destructive potential necessitates stringent international regulations.  The management of nuclear waste, however, remains a significant challenge demanding ongoing research into advanced reactor designs and efficient waste disposal methodologies.
