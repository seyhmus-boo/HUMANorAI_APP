Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional properties, exhibit remarkable interdisciplinary relevance.  Their unique cylindrical structure, comprised of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices, dictates their exceptional mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel at a significantly lower density. This exceptional strength, coupled with their high aspect ratio, finds applications in materials science, notably in the development of high-strength composites and advanced nano-scale devices.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate exceptional electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality, a property of immense interest to electrical engineering and electronics.  This tunable conductivity enables applications in transistors, sensors, and flexible electronics.  The large surface area of CNTs, particularly crucial in their application as catalysts and energy storage materials, is a critical factor in chemistry and chemical engineering, influencing their use in catalysis, fuel cells, and supercapacitors.  Finally, their unique optical properties, such as strong absorption in the near-infrared region, are exploited in biomedical imaging and drug delivery, showcasing the interdisciplinary reach of CNT research across materials science, chemistry, physics, electrical engineering, and biomedicine.
