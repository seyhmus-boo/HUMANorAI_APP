Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is a process with profound interdisciplinary implications.  Physics underpins the fundamental understanding of nuclear forces and energy levels involved in the fission process, utilising models like the liquid drop model to predict fissionability.  However, the engineering challenges in harnessing this energy are substantial.  Chemical engineering plays a crucial role in designing and operating nuclear reactors, managing radioactive waste, and ensuring the safe handling of fissile materials.  Material science is vital in developing radiation-resistant materials for reactor components and in designing effective containment structures.  Furthermore, the environmental impact of fission necessitates input from environmental science and geology, particularly concerning long-term radioactive waste disposal and its impact on ecosystems.  Finally, the social sciences, encompassing economics and political science, are essential in addressing the ethical, economic, and geopolitical considerations surrounding nuclear energy production and its applications.  Therefore, understanding nuclear fission necessitates a truly interdisciplinary approach.
