Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Its historical roots lie in the theoretical work of physicists like Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, who, in 1938, observed the unexpected fission of uranium-235 upon neutron bombardment, a finding subsequently explained by Meitner and Frisch using theoretical models of nuclear forces.  This groundbreaking achievement immediately suggested the possibility of immense energy release, a concept rapidly exploited during the Manhattan Project.

The process itself is initiated by the absorption of a neutron by a fissile nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239.  This destabilizes the nucleus, causing it to undergo fission, releasing a considerable amount of energy primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and prompt neutrons.  Crucially, these released neutrons can induce further fission events in surrounding fissile material, leading to a chain reaction.  Control over this chain reaction is essential in nuclear reactors, achieved through the use of neutron moderators and control rods.  Conversely, uncontrolled chain reactions characterize nuclear weapons, harnessing the explosive potential of fission.  Understanding the intricacies of fission, including neutron cross-sections and energy yields, remains a crucial aspect of nuclear engineering and physics.
