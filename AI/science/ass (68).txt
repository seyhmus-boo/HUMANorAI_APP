DNA replication is the fundamental process by which a cell duplicates its genome prior to cell division, ensuring the faithful transmission of genetic information to daughter cells.  This semiconservative process involves the unwinding of the double helix by enzymes like helicases, creating a replication fork.  Single-stranded binding proteins prevent reannealing, while DNA primase synthesizes RNA primers to initiate DNA polymerase activity.  DNA polymerase III then adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the primer, synthesizing the leading and lagging strands in a 5' to 3' direction.  The lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments, which are subsequently joined by DNA ligase.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerase.  The accuracy of DNA replication is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing mutations.  Practical applications of understanding DNA replication are extensive.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, a cornerstone of molecular biology, mimics this process to amplify specific DNA sequences for diverse applications, including forensic science, diagnostics, and gene cloning. Furthermore, an understanding of replication fidelity informs strategies for cancer treatment targeting replication machinery and the development of novel antiviral therapies targeting viral DNA replication.  The study of DNA replication continues to be crucial for advancements in various fields of science and medicine.
