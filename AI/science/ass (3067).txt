Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a crucial resource for emerging quantum technologies. This presentation will provide a concise overview of entanglement, emphasizing its non-classical correlations and contrasting it with classical correlations. We will discuss recent breakthroughs in generating and manipulating entangled states, focusing on advancements in scalable platforms.  Significant progress has been made in generating high-fidelity entanglement across various systems, including trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonic systems.  This improved control has facilitated the development of novel quantum algorithms and protocols. We will highlight recent experimental demonstrations of entanglement distribution over extended distances, showcasing progress towards a quantum internet.  Furthermore, the presentation will touch upon the challenges in scaling up entangled systems and the crucial role of error correction in building fault-tolerant quantum computers.  Finally, we will briefly explore the implications of recent advancements for future applications in quantum sensing, quantum computing, and quantum communication.
