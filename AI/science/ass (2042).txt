This presentation explores the role of catalysts in organic chemistry through the lens of quantum mechanics.  We will examine how computational methods, specifically density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio calculations, provide crucial insights into catalytic mechanisms that are often inaccessible through experimental means alone.  The focus will be on elucidating the electronic structure changes occurring at the catalyst-reactant interface, highlighting the importance of frontier molecular orbitals in determining reaction pathways and activation barriers.  We will showcase case studies illustrating how quantum chemical calculations can predict catalyst activity and selectivity, identifying key structural features responsible for enhanced performance.  Specific examples will include transition metal catalysis, focusing on the crucial role of d-orbitals in facilitating bond breaking and formation, and organocatalysis, highlighting the importance of non-covalent interactions such as hydrogen bonding and π-π stacking. Finally, we will discuss the challenges and limitations of current computational approaches and suggest promising avenues for future research, particularly in the development of more accurate and efficient methods for modelling complex catalytic systems.
