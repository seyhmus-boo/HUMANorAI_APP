Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked, exhibiting correlated behaviour regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation transcends classical physics, violating Bell's inequalities and demonstrating the non-locality inherent in quantum mechanics.  Entangled particles share a combined quantum state, meaning measurement of one instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of distance.  This does not allow for faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of the measurement on one particle remains probabilistic until measured.

Recent developments focus on enhancing control and scalability of entangled systems.  Significant progress has been made in generating entanglement between larger numbers of qubits, utilizing platforms like superconducting circuits and trapped ions.  This advancement facilitates the creation of more complex quantum states essential for quantum computing and simulation. Moreover, research into entanglement distribution over longer distances, employing techniques like quantum repeaters, is progressing, bridging the gap towards a practical quantum internet. The ongoing exploration of entanglement's fundamental limits and its exploitation for technological applications remains a vibrant area of quantum research.
