DNA replication, the fundamental process of duplicating a cell's genome, remains a central area of biological inquiry.  Its fidelity is paramount for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing disease, while its speed and efficiency are crucial for cellular proliferation and organismal development.  Classical models have described the process as a semi-conservative mechanism involving DNA polymerases, helicases, and numerous accessory proteins. However, recent advancements have significantly refined our understanding beyond this basic framework.  High-resolution imaging techniques, such as cryo-electron microscopy, have provided unprecedented structural insights into the replisome, revealing dynamic interactions between replication proteins and the intricate choreography of DNA unwinding, priming, and polymerization.  Furthermore, single-molecule studies have quantified the kinetics of individual replication enzymes, revealing surprising heterogeneity in replication speed and processivity.  Advances in genome sequencing technologies have also allowed for comprehensive analyses of replication origins, revealing their complex organization and regulation, including the impact of epigenetic modifications and chromatin structure. This review will synthesize these recent developments, focusing on the emergent complexities of the replication process and their implications for genome stability, disease, and potential therapeutic interventions.
