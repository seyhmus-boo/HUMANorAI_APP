Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature.  Fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, is fundamentally a physics phenomenon governed by the strong and weak nuclear forces.  However, its applications and consequences extend far beyond physics.

The controlled release of energy through fission, as harnessed in nuclear reactors, necessitates sophisticated engineering solutions.  Material science plays a crucial role in designing reactor components capable of withstanding extreme temperatures and radiation.  Chemistry is vital for understanding the behaviour of radioactive isotopes and developing methods for nuclear fuel reprocessing and waste management.  Furthermore, the societal impact of nuclear power – encompassing energy policy, economics, and public health – necessitates input from the social sciences and humanities.  The environmental implications, including long-term radioactive waste disposal and potential accidents, necessitate a multidisciplinary approach encompassing environmental science, geology, and risk assessment.  Therefore, a complete understanding of nuclear fission demands a truly interdisciplinary perspective.
