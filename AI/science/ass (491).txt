Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles.  The process initiates when a neutron interacts with the target nucleus, typically via the strong nuclear force, a short-range interaction described by quantum chromodynamics.  This interaction perturbs the nuclear wavefunction, causing a transition to a higher energy state.  Crucially, the potential energy landscape of the nucleus, influenced by the interplay of the strong and Coulomb forces, exhibits a double-humped structure. Tunneling, a quantum phenomenon where a particle can penetrate a potential barrier even if its energy is insufficient to overcome it classically, plays a pivotal role.  The probability of fission depends on the tunneling probability through this barrier, influenced by the shape of the potential and the energy of the nucleus.  Following tunneling, the nucleus deforms, ultimately overcoming the Coulomb repulsion, leading to scission and the release of kinetic energy primarily attributed to the Coulombic repulsion of the fission fragments.  The precise nature of the fragments and the accompanying neutron emission are statistically determined, reflecting the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics inherent in the wavefunction collapse during scission.  Furthermore, resonance effects within the compound nucleus further modulate the fission cross-section.
