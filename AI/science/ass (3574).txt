Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, regardless of the physical distance separating them.  Their fates are intertwined; measuring a property of one particle instantaneously influences the corresponding property of the other, even across vast interstellar distances.  This defies classical intuition, which suggests independent, locally determined behaviours.

Imagine two coins, magically linked.  If one lands heads, the other *must* land tails, regardless of how far apart they are flipped.  This is analogous to entanglement, where the "heads" and "tails" represent specific quantum states.  However, unlike classical coins whose states are pre-determined, entangled particles do not possess definite properties until measured.  Before measurement, they exist in a superposition, a probabilistic blend of possible states.  The act of measurement collapses this superposition, instantly determining the state of both particles.

Einstein famously referred to this "spooky action at a distance."  The instantaneous correlation isn't due to faster-than-light signalling, as no information is transmitted. Rather, the entangled particles share a combined quantum state described by a single wave function, violating the principle of locality inherent in classical physics. This interconnectedness forms the basis for several emerging quantum technologies, including quantum computing and cryptography.
