Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon perplexing physicists since its theoretical prediction by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in their 1935 paradox.  EPR argued that quantum mechanics, as then understood, implied "spooky action at a distance"â€”correlations between spatially separated particles exceeding classical limits.  Their thought experiment highlighted the apparent non-locality inherent in the theory.

Experimental verification, however, began much later, with Alain Aspect's experiments in the 1980s confirming the violation of Bell's inequalities, a mathematical framework designed to test the EPR paradox.  These experiments demonstrated that entangled particles, sharing a combined quantum state, exhibit correlated behaviour regardless of the distance separating them.  Measurement of one particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, even across vast distances, defying classical intuition.  This counterintuitive feature of quantum entanglement continues to be a subject of intense research, with implications spanning quantum computing, cryptography, and our fundamental understanding of reality.
