Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of sp²-hybridized carbon atoms, have captivated the scientific community for their exceptional physicochemical properties.  Their unique combination of high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity, and exceptional thermal properties positions them as promising candidates for a diverse range of applications, from advanced composites to next-generation electronics.  This paper reviews the key properties of CNTs, focusing on recent advancements that refine our understanding and expand their potential.  Significant strides have been made in controlling CNT chirality and diameter, leading to more precise tailoring of their electronic properties.  This precise control facilitates the development of high-performance transistors and other nanoscale devices.  Furthermore, advancements in scalable synthesis techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and plasma-enhanced CVD, have significantly improved the yield and purity of CNT production, making them increasingly accessible for industrial applications.  The ongoing research into functionalization strategies – including covalent and non-covalent modifications – allows for the fine-tuning of CNT dispersibility and interfacial interactions, opening up new avenues for their integration into various matrices and devices.  This review will explore these recent developments and their implications for the future of CNT-based technologies.
