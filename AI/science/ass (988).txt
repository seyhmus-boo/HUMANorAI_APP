Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with unique cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties rendering them attractive for diverse applications.  This review summarizes key characteristics driving their technological potential.  CNTs demonstrate remarkable mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel with significantly lower density, a crucial feature for lightweight, high-strength composites.  Their electrical conductivity varies significantly depending on chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, offering versatility in electronic applications.  Furthermore, their high aspect ratio and large surface area contribute to exceptional thermal conductivity and adsorption capabilities, making them ideal for thermal management and energy storage.  However, challenges remain, including the control of chirality during synthesis, efficient dispersion in composite matrices, and the potential toxicity associated with certain CNT types.  Further research focusing on scalable, cost-effective synthesis methods and detailed toxicity assessments is crucial for realizing the full potential of CNTs across various technological sectors, from aerospace and electronics to biomedical engineering and environmental remediation.
