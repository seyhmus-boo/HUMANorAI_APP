The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting such intense gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical groundwork, laid by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the late 18th century, posited the existence of "dark stars" – objects massive enough to prevent light from escaping their gravitational pull.  However, these concepts lacked the framework of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, published in 1915, which provided the rigorous mathematical description necessary to understand black hole formation.  General Relativity predicted the existence of black holes as a consequence of gravitational collapse, a process where a sufficiently massive star, having exhausted its nuclear fuel, implodes under its own gravity.  The critical mass required for this collapse is determined by the star's initial mass and composition, with stars exceeding a certain threshold – typically several times the mass of our Sun – being prime candidates for black hole formation.  The final stages of collapse are complex, involving phenomena like the formation of a singularity – a point of infinite density – and the generation of powerful gravitational waves.  Observational evidence, such as the detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes and the observation of stellar-mass black holes orbiting other stars, strongly supports this theoretical framework.
