Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional properties, exhibit remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  Their cylindrical structure, composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices, underpins their unique functionalities.  Mechanically, CNTs boast exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel.  Electrically, they can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality, offering potential for advanced electronics.  Furthermore, their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation.

Recent developments focus on refining CNT synthesis and processing to enhance their application potential.  Techniques like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are being optimized for controlled diameter and chirality selection, leading to improved device performance.  Significant progress has been made in developing scalable production methods for high-quality, defect-free CNTs.  Moreover, research into functionalization strategies, including covalent and non-covalent modifications, aims to improve CNT dispersibility and compatibility with various matrices for composite materials.  These advancements are paving the way for wider implementation in fields such as advanced composites, energy storage, sensors, and biomedical applications.
