Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional properties, present significant experimental challenges despite their potential in diverse applications.  Their inherent tendency to agglomerate due to strong van der Waals forces complicates dispersion and necessitates the development of sophisticated functionalization techniques, often impacting their intrinsic properties.  Precise control over CNT chirality, crucial for tailoring electronic properties, remains a substantial hurdle.  Synthesis methods, while advancing, frequently yield heterogeneous mixtures of nanotubes with varying diameters, lengths, and chiralities, requiring complex purification and sorting procedures.  Accurate characterization also poses challenges.  Determining the precise structural parameters (chirality, diameter) of individual nanotubes requires advanced techniques such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy, which are often time-consuming and require specialized expertise.  Furthermore, the development of reliable and scalable methods for measuring and controlling the mechanical properties of individual CNTs under diverse conditions is an ongoing area of intensive research, hindering the realization of their full potential in structural applications.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is paramount for unlocking the full potential of CNTs.
