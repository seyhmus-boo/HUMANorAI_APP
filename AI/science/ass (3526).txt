DNA replication, the process by which a double-stranded DNA molecule produces two identical copies, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding stemmed from Chargaff's rules (1950), demonstrating base pairing ratios, and the subsequent elucidation of the double helix structure by Watson and Crick (1953).  This model suggested a semiconservative mechanism â€“ each new DNA molecule retains one parental strand and incorporates one newly synthesized strand.  This hypothesis was experimentally validated by Meselson and Stahl (1958) using density gradient centrifugation.

The process itself involves unwinding the double helix by helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins prevent re-annealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate synthesis in a 5' to 3' direction, continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand (forming Okazaki fragments).  DNA polymerase I removes primers and fills gaps, while DNA ligase joins Okazaki fragments.  Proofreading mechanisms, inherent to DNA polymerases, maintain fidelity.  Telomerase addresses the replication problem at chromosome ends.  The coordinated action of these enzymes ensures accurate and efficient duplication of the genome, critical for cell division and heredity.
