Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, exhibiting non-local behavior violating Bell's inequalities.  From a quantum mechanical perspective, entangled particles are described by a single, composite wavefunction, not as individual systems.  Measurement on one entangled particle instantaneously collapses the wavefunction, determining the state of the other, regardless of distance, a feature seemingly at odds with the principle of locality.

The theoretical framework of entanglement arises from the tensor product structure of Hilbert spaces, representing the combined system's state as a superposition of entangled states.  Different entanglement types exist, including Bell states representing maximal entanglement.  The implications are far-reaching, extending beyond fundamental physics.  Entanglement forms the basis for quantum computing, enabling the development of quantum algorithms surpassing classical counterparts in computational power.  Despite its profound implications, the precise nature of entanglement and its interpretation remain subjects of ongoing debate, particularly regarding the non-local correlations and their potential impact on our understanding of spacetime.
