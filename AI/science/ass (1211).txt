Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of rolled-up graphene sheets, have captivated the scientific community since their discovery in 1991 by Iijima.  This presentation will explore the remarkable properties of CNTs that underpin their potential for a wide array of applications.  We will examine their exceptional mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel at a significantly lower density, and their unique electrical characteristics.  Depending on their chirality (the arrangement of carbon atoms), CNTs can exhibit metallic or semiconducting behaviour, making them promising candidates for nanoelectronics.  Their high aspect ratio and large surface area contribute to their exceptional thermal conductivity and adsorption capabilities, opening doors for applications in thermal management and catalysis.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly touch upon the challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and scalable production, which are crucial for their widespread adoption.  We will conclude by highlighting the ongoing research focused on harnessing the full potential of CNTs in diverse fields, from advanced composites and energy storage to biomedical devices and sensors.  This overview aims to provide a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the fascinating world of carbon nanotube properties and their implications.
