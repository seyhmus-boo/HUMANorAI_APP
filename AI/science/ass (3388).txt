Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that they exhibit correlated behavior, even when spatially separated.  This correlation transcends classical physics, defying intuitive explanations based on local realism.  The theoretical groundwork was laid in the 1930s by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in their famous EPR paradox, which argued that quantum mechanics was incomplete due to its seemingly paradoxical predictions regarding entangled particles.  Their thought experiment highlighted the seemingly instantaneous correlation between measurements of entangled particles, suggesting a violation of localityâ€”the principle that an object can only be influenced by its immediate surroundings.  However, subsequent work, notably Bell's theorem (1964), provided a framework for experimentally testing the predictions of quantum mechanics against local realism.  Numerous experiments since then have consistently confirmed the predictions of quantum mechanics, demonstrating the reality of entanglement and thus the violation of Bell inequalities.  This non-classical correlation forms the basis for emerging quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum cryptography, harnessing the power of entangled states for enhanced computational capabilities and secure communication protocols.
