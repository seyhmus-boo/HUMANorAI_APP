Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the interplay of the strong nuclear force, which binds nucleons, and the Coulomb repulsion between protons.  A quantum mechanical description necessitates considering the collective behavior of nucleons, often approximated using models such as the liquid drop model or the shell model.  These models account for the nuclear deformation and the tunneling probability through the potential barrier separating the initial compound nucleus from the fission fragments.  The probability of fission is strongly influenced by the quantum states of the nucleus, particularly the excitation energy and the nuclear shape isomerism.  Furthermore, the emission of neutrons during fission is a direct consequence of the energy redistribution among the fragments and the subsequent decay of highly excited states.  The detailed theoretical understanding of fission requires sophisticated quantum many-body techniques, often employing computational approaches like density functional theory or Monte Carlo methods.  Advances in these computational techniques are continually refining our understanding of the complex quantum dynamics involved in nuclear fission, with implications for nuclear energy and nuclear astrophysics.
