DNA replication, the precise duplication of the genome, is fundamental to life. This presentation will provide an overview of the intricate mechanisms governing this process, focusing on the key enzymes and proteins involved. We will explore the semiconservative nature of replication, highlighting the unwinding of the double helix by helicases, the stabilization of single-stranded DNA by single-strand binding proteins, and the role of primase in RNA primer synthesis.  The central role of DNA polymerases in adding nucleotides to the growing strand, following the 5’ to 3’ direction, will be discussed, emphasizing the differences between leading and lagging strand synthesis and the formation of Okazaki fragments.  Furthermore, we will examine the fidelity mechanisms ensuring high accuracy, including proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and mismatch repair pathways.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the challenges posed by replication in eukaryotic cells, including the complexities of replicating telomeres and the coordination of replication with cell cycle progression. This overview aims to provide a comprehensive yet accessible understanding of this crucial biological process.
