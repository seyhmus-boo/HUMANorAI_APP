Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, are a subject of intense scientific investigation. This presentation explores the quantum mechanical underpinnings of these remarkable characteristics. We will examine the electronic structure of CNTs, derived from the Ï€-electron network within their graphene-based cylindrical structure, focusing on the impact of chirality and diameter on band gap and conductivity.  The relationship between the quantum confinement effect and the resulting electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour, will be discussed.  Further, we will delve into the vibrational properties of CNTs, exploring the phonon dispersion relations and their influence on thermal conductivity and mechanical strength.  A key focus will be on how quantum mechanical simulations, such as density functional theory (DFT) calculations, provide critical insights into these properties, enabling predictive modelling and guiding the design of CNT-based materials for advanced applications.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon challenges and future directions in the quantum mechanical modelling of CNTs, including the complexities of defect modelling and many-body interactions.
