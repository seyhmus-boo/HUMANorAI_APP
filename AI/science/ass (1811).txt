DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning life, remains a vibrant area of research.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of the core mechanisms of eukaryotic DNA replication, focusing on the interplay between the replisome components and the challenges presented by complex genomic architecture.  We will highlight recent advancements in our understanding of origin firing control, emphasizing the roles of chromatin structure and regulatory factors like the origin recognition complex (ORC) and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs).  Emerging techniques like single-molecule imaging have revolutionized our ability to visualize replication dynamics in real-time, revealing previously unappreciated aspects of replisome processivity and the response to replication stress.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss recent breakthroughs in understanding the mechanisms of replication fork restart and the intricate pathways involved in resolving stalled replication forks to prevent genome instability.  Finally, we will briefly explore the implications of these discoveries for understanding diseases linked to replication defects, such as cancer and premature aging, and the potential for therapeutic intervention.
