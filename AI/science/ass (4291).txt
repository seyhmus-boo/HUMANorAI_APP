Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into smaller nuclei, is a process driven by the strong nuclear force and governed by quantum mechanics.  This exothermic reaction releases a significant amount of energy, primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  The mass defect, dictated by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²), accounts for the substantial energy yield.  Criticality, the condition where the neutron production rate equals or exceeds the neutron loss rate, is paramount for sustaining a chain reaction.  This necessitates a sufficient concentration of fissile material, like Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, often moderated to control neutron speeds.

Practical applications of fission are primarily focused on energy generation.  Nuclear power plants leverage controlled chain reactions within reactors to produce heat, which drives turbines and generates electricity.  This provides a reliable, high-power density energy source, albeit with associated risks of radioactive waste and potential for accidents.  Furthermore, fission plays a crucial role in the production of medical isotopes used in diagnostics and therapy, alongside applications in industrial radiography and materials science. Military applications, while ethically complex, also utilize the immense energy release of fission in nuclear weaponry.  However, the long-term challenges related to radioactive waste management and nuclear proliferation remain significant concerns.
