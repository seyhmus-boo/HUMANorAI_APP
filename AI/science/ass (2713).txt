The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem from their unique sp²-hybridized carbon structure, fostering significant interdisciplinary research.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength, surpassing that of steel by a considerable margin, is crucial for materials science applications in advanced composites and high-strength fibers.  Remarkably high electrical conductivity, comparable to copper, arises from the delocalized π-electrons, making them attractive for nanoelectronics and sensor development.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit excellent thermal conductivity, surpassing many metals, influencing their use in thermal management systems and energy applications.  These properties, however, are heavily dependent on factors such as diameter, chirality, and degree of purity, highlighting the importance of precise synthesis and characterization techniques – a realm demanding collaborations between chemistry and materials science.  Their large surface area, coupled with tunable electronic properties, provides immense potential in catalysis, energy storage (e.g., in lithium-ion batteries), and biomedical applications like drug delivery, demanding expertise across chemistry, biology, and medicine.  Finally, the study of CNT mechanics necessitates sophisticated modeling and simulation techniques, bridging materials science with computational physics and engineering.
