Black hole formation is a pivotal process in astrophysics, primarily arising from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses under its own immense gravity.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), no known force can counteract the collapse, resulting in a singularity – a point of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon, defining the black hole.

Recent developments have focused on refining our understanding of this process.  Numerical simulations, incorporating increasingly sophisticated models of stellar evolution and general relativity, are providing greater accuracy in predicting black hole properties, such as mass and spin, depending on the progenitor star's initial characteristics.  Furthermore, observations of gravitational waves from merging black holes, facilitated by detectors like LIGO and Virgo, are providing invaluable empirical data.  These observations confirm the existence of stellar-mass black holes and offer constraints on their formation mechanisms, including the potential role of binary interactions and common envelope evolution.  Investigations into intermediate-mass black holes, bridging the gap between stellar and supermassive black holes, remain an area of active research and debate, with potential formation pathways involving runaway stellar collisions in dense star clusters.
