Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, driving significant interdisciplinary research.  Their unique combination of high tensile strength, Young's modulus exceeding that of steel, and remarkable flexibility underpins their potential in advanced materials science, from lightweight composites for aerospace applications to flexible electronics.  Electrically, CNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality, offering opportunities in nanoelectronics and sensor development.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation in microelectronics and thermal management systems.  Beyond material science, CNTs' biocompatibility and surface functionalizability are exploited in biomedical engineering, with applications ranging from drug delivery vehicles and biosensors to regenerative medicine scaffolds.  However, challenges remain, including scalable production methods, precise control over chirality for tailored properties, and addressing potential toxicity concerns.  Overcoming these challenges through interdisciplinary collaborations across chemistry, physics, materials science, biology, and engineering is crucial for unlocking the full potential of CNTs.
