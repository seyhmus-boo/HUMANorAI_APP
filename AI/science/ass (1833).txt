Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of spatial separation, presents significant experimental challenges.  These challenges primarily stem from the fragility of entangled states to environmental noise, leading to decoherence and the loss of entanglement.  Maintaining coherence necessitates extremely low temperatures, high vacuum environments, and sophisticated shielding from electromagnetic interference.  Furthermore, generating and verifying high-fidelity entangled states, particularly for multi-partite systems, requires precise control over individual quantum systems and robust quantum state tomography techniques. Scalability also poses a major hurdle; extending entanglement to larger numbers of particles or greater distances significantly amplifies the impact of noise and increases the complexity of experimental apparatus.  Overcoming these experimental limitations, including the development of improved quantum control techniques and the design of robust quantum memory, is crucial for advancing applications in quantum computing, communication, and sensing.  Significant progress has been made, yet substantial technological hurdles remain before the full potential of entangled systems can be realized.
