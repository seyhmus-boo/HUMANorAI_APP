DNA replication, the fundamental process of duplicating the genome, is meticulously orchestrated to ensure high fidelity and complete duplication of the genetic material.  This review summarizes the key features of this process, focusing on the intricate interplay of enzymes and proteins involved.  The initiation phase, marked by origin recognition and unwinding of the double helix by helicases, sets the stage for the action of DNA polymerases.  These enzymes, working in a semi-conservative manner, synthesize new DNA strands, utilizing the existing strands as templates. The leading and lagging strands are synthesized differently, leading to the formation of Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand which subsequently require ligation.  Proofreading mechanisms, inherent to certain polymerases, ensure accuracy; however, mismatch repair systems further contribute to fidelity.  Telomere replication, a distinct aspect requiring telomerase activity, is crucial for maintaining chromosomal integrity.  This review highlights the remarkable precision and complexity of DNA replication, underscoring its vital role in cellular proliferation and genetic inheritance.  Future research should focus on further elucidating the regulation and potential therapeutic targeting of this crucial cellular process, particularly in the context of aging and disease.
