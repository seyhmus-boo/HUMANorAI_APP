Catalysts in organic chemistry are indispensable for facilitating reactions that would otherwise proceed too slowly or not at all under typical conditions. Their function relies on lowering the activation energy of a reaction by providing an alternative, lower-energy reaction pathway, without being consumed themselves in the overall process.  This interdisciplinary field draws heavily upon physical chemistry for understanding reaction mechanisms and kinetics, employing techniques like computational chemistry (DFT calculations) to model catalyst-substrate interactions and predict catalytic activity.

Furthermore, inorganic chemistry plays a crucial role in catalyst design and synthesis, focusing on the properties of transition metals and their ligands to tailor catalytic activity and selectivity.  Materials science contributes by exploring heterogeneous catalysts, such as metal nanoparticles supported on various materials, influencing surface area, porosity, and stability.  Ultimately, the efficacy of a catalyst is assessed through analytical chemistry techniques like NMR, GC-MS, and HPLC, allowing for product quantification and structural elucidation.  The impact of catalysts extends to other fields such as biology (enzyme catalysis) and engineering (process optimization), highlighting their pervasive significance.
