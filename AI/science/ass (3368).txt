Black hole formation remains a central yet experimentally challenging problem in astrophysics.  While the theoretical framework of general relativity robustly predicts their existence via stellar collapse and galactic mergers, direct observational confirmation of the formation process itself remains elusive.  The extreme gravitational fields involved render traditional electromagnetic probes ineffective, limiting our ability to directly witness the crucial stages of singularity creation. Gravitational wave astronomy, while offering invaluable insights into the mergers of already-formed black holes, provides limited information on the initial collapse stages.  Neutrino observations present another avenue, potentially capturing information from the core collapse supernovae that often precede black hole formation, yet  detecting the faint neutrino signal amidst background noise presents a significant technical hurdle.  Furthermore, modelling the complex interplay of hydrodynamic instabilities, magnetic fields, and nuclear reactions within collapsing stellar cores remains computationally demanding and susceptible to uncertainties in the equation of state of dense matter.  Overcoming these experimental limitations necessitates further advancements in both detector sensitivity (gravitational wave and neutrino) and high-fidelity numerical simulations, ideally coupled with multi-messenger approaches that combine data from diverse sources.
