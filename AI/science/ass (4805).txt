Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of carbon atoms.  Their discovery, serendipitously observed in the late 1980s by Sumio Iijima using transmission electron microscopy, marked a pivotal moment in materials science.  CNTs exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, boasting tensile strength significantly higher than steel, while maintaining remarkable flexibility.  Their electrical conductivity is equally impressive, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality â€“ the helical arrangement of carbon atoms.  This unique property makes them attractive for a broad range of applications in electronics.

Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  Their large surface area-to-volume ratio contributes to significant adsorption capabilities, making them suitable for applications like gas storage and catalysis. However, challenges remain in large-scale, cost-effective production and effective dispersion within composite materials.  Despite these hurdles, ongoing research continues to unlock the vast potential of carbon nanotubes across diverse technological fields.
