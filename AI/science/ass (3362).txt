Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional properties rendering them attractive for diverse applications. This presentation will overview the key characteristics defining CNT behavior and potential.  We will discuss the influence of chirality and diameter on electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, highlighting the impact on device fabrication.  Mechanical properties, including exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, will be examined, along with their implications for composite materials and nanomechanical devices.  Furthermore, the thermal conductivity of CNTs, significantly exceeding that of copper, will be explored, focusing on its relevance to thermal management applications.  The presentation will also touch upon the challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and functionalization, crucial aspects for realizing their full potential in various technological sectors. Finally, emerging research areas and future directions for CNT-based technologies will be briefly discussed, focusing on advancements in scalable production and integration into complex systems.
