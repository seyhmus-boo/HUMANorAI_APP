Nuclear fission is the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy and gamma radiation. This splitting is induced by the absorption of a neutron, causing the nucleus to become unstable and subsequently fission.  The process is chain-reactive; the released neutrons can trigger further fission events in other nuclei, leading to a sustained nuclear reaction.  This chain reaction is controlled in nuclear reactors through the use of neutron-absorbing control rods.

The immense energy released from fission has several practical applications.  Most notably, it serves as a primary energy source in nuclear power plants, generating electricity on a large scale.  Furthermore, fission is utilized in the production of medical isotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, such as iodine-131 for thyroid treatment.  While the primary application is energy production, the intense neutron flux generated by fission reactors is also exploited in materials research and neutron activation analysis for determining elemental composition.  However, the inherent risks associated with radioactive waste and the potential for nuclear accidents necessitate stringent safety protocols and careful consideration of long-term waste management strategies.
