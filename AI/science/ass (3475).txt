This presentation offers a contemporary overview of chemical bonding and molecular structure, focusing on recent advancements that refine our understanding of these fundamental concepts.  Traditional valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory, while providing robust frameworks, are increasingly complemented by sophisticated computational techniques.  We will explore the growing application of density functional theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock methods in accurately predicting molecular geometries and properties, particularly for larger and more complex systems beyond the scope of traditional methods.  Recent progress in characterizing non-covalent interactions, including weak hydrogen bonds and van der Waals forces, using advanced experimental techniques such as NMR spectroscopy and sophisticated computational approaches like SAPT (symmetry-adapted perturbation theory), will be highlighted.  Furthermore, we will discuss emerging areas of research, including the exploration of unconventional bonding scenarios in novel materials and the development of machine learning algorithms for accelerating the prediction of molecular properties.  The presentation aims to bridge the gap between established theories and cutting-edge research, offering a comprehensive yet concise overview of this dynamic field.
