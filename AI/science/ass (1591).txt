Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, combined with remarkable flexibility, makes them attractive for reinforcing composite materials in aerospace and automotive applications.  Depending on chirality, CNTs can behave as metallic or semiconducting materials, enabling their use in advanced electronics such as high-frequency transistors and flexible displays. Their high aspect ratio and surface area facilitate their application as efficient catalysts and adsorbents in environmental remediation, notably in water purification and gas sensing.  Furthermore, their exceptional thermal conductivity allows for their integration into thermal management systems for electronics.  However, challenges remain regarding scalable, cost-effective production,  consistent quality control, and the potential toxicity associated with their handling and environmental release.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these limitations to fully realize the transformative potential of CNTs across diverse technological sectors.
