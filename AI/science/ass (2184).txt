Chemical bonding and molecular structure remain fundamental concepts underpinning our understanding of chemistry and materials science.  While classical theories like valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory provide a robust framework for describing bonding, recent advancements have significantly refined our predictive capabilities and expanded the scope of investigation to increasingly complex systems.  This paper explores the interplay between chemical bonding and molecular structure, focusing on recent developments in several key areas.  Specifically, we examine the burgeoning field of  machine learning applied to predict and understand bonding characteristics, including its application in discovering novel materials with tailored properties.  Furthermore, we discuss advancements in experimental techniques, such as advanced spectroscopies and high-resolution microscopy, providing unprecedented detail on molecular geometries and electronic structures.  The impact of relativistic effects on heavy-element bonding will also be considered, highlighting their crucial role in accurately modelling the behavior of compounds containing elements beyond the third row. Finally, we will briefly explore the implications of these advancements for diverse applications, ranging from drug design and catalysis to the development of novel energy materials.
