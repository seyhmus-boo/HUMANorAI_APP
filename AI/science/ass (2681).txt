Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, presents a profound departure from classical intuition.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of entanglement from a purely quantum mechanical perspective, focusing on its mathematical formalism and physical implications.  We will begin by defining entangled states, illustrating their non-separability using Bell states as a prime example.  The violation of Bell inequalities, experimentally verified numerous times, will be discussed as definitive proof of the existence of entanglement and its incompatibility with local realism.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the role of entanglement in quantum information science, highlighting its crucial function in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  We will briefly touch upon the challenges of maintaining entanglement, namely decoherence, and explore potential mitigation strategies.  Finally, we will conclude by considering open questions and future research directions in the field, emphasizing the continued exploration of entanglement's fundamental implications for our understanding of the universe.
