Black hole formation remains a key area of astrophysical research, with ongoing refinements to our understanding of the processes involved.  The canonical model posits that stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (â‰¥8 solar masses) at the end of their lifecycles.  Recent high-precision observations from gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo have provided direct evidence for black hole mergers, confirming theoretical predictions and offering invaluable data on their masses and spins.  These observations also hint at a potential population of black holes formed through alternative pathways, such as direct collapse scenarios in low-metallicity environments, where rapid accretion prevents the formation of a supernova.  Furthermore, advancements in numerical relativity have enabled increasingly sophisticated simulations of core collapse, providing insights into the complex interplay of neutrino emission, magnetic fields, and rotation during the collapse process.  These simulations are crucial for clarifying the conditions that favour the formation of black holes versus neutron stars, and for predicting the properties of the resulting black holes.  The study of black hole formation continues to be a dynamic field, with ongoing developments enriching our comprehension of these enigmatic objects and their role in the evolution of galaxies.
