Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, predominantly occurs via two distinct mechanisms: C3 and C4.  C3 photosynthesis, the most widespread, involves the initial fixation of CO2 by RuBisCO in the Calvin cycle.  However, RuBisCO's affinity for O2 leads to photorespiration, a wasteful process reducing efficiency.  C4 photosynthesis, prevalent in arid and high-light environments, spatially separates CO2 fixation (by PEP carboxylase) and the Calvin cycle, minimizing photorespiration.  

Recent research has focused on enhancing photosynthetic efficiency.  CRISPR-Cas9 technology is being employed to engineer RuBisCO with improved kinetic properties, thereby reducing photorespiration in C3 plants.  Furthermore, studies exploring the introduction of C4-like characteristics into C3 plants, through metabolic engineering, aim to bolster productivity.  Simultaneously, investigations into the role of alternative electron transport pathways and the optimisation of light-harvesting complexes are underway, aiming to improve overall energy capture and utilization within photosynthetic machinery.  These developments promise significant advancements in crop yields and biofuel production.
