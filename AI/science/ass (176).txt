Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in the lifecycle of massive stars.  When a star with a mass exceeding approximately 20 solar masses exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer sustain itself against its own immense gravity. The core collapses catastrophically, triggering a supernova explosion that expels the outer layers.  If the remaining core mass surpasses the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), even the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is insufficient to counterbalance gravity, resulting in the formation of a singularity – a black hole.  Alternatively, stellar-mass black holes may form through the direct collapse of massive stars without a supernova event.  Supermassive black holes, residing at the centers of most galaxies, likely originate through a combination of accretion of surrounding matter and mergers of smaller black holes.  Understanding black hole formation is crucial for refining models of stellar evolution and galactic dynamics.  Practical applications of this knowledge extend to gravitational wave astronomy, where the detection of merging black holes provides valuable insights into both black hole properties and the nature of gravity itself.  Furthermore, studies of active galactic nuclei, powered by supermassive black holes, inform our comprehension of galaxy evolution and the distribution of matter in the universe.
