Black hole formation is a consequence of extreme gravitational collapse. Imagine a massive star, a celestial body many times the mass of our Sun, nearing the end of its lifespan.  Its nuclear fuel exhausted, the outward pressure from fusion ceases, and the star's immense gravity becomes the dominant force.  This is analogous to a deflating balloon – the internal pressure supporting its shape is gone, and it collapses inwards.

However, unlike a balloon, the star's collapse isn't halted.  Gravity relentlessly compresses the stellar material until it reaches a point of singularity – a region of infinite density. This singularity is surrounded by an event horizon, a boundary beyond which even light cannot escape, akin to a point of no return in a powerful whirlpool.  The stronger the initial gravitational pull (i.e., the greater the star's initial mass), the more swiftly and completely the collapse occurs.  While stellar-mass black holes originate from this supernova-induced collapse, supermassive black holes at galactic centers likely form via a different, less understood process involving mergers and accretion of matter over cosmic timescales.  In essence, black holes are the ultimate consequence of gravity's overpowering influence on sufficiently dense matter.
