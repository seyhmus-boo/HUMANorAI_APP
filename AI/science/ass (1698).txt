Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, has been a central focus of biological research since its discovery.  Early understanding, stemming from Jan Ingenhousz's 18th-century observations on plant oxygen production in light, laid the foundation for later investigations.  The 20th century witnessed significant advancements, notably the elucidation of the two principal stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent (Calvin) cycle.

The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, utilizing photosystems I and II.  These systems, containing chlorophyll and accessory pigments, capture light energy, driving electron transport chains and generating ATP and NADPH.  Water is split (photolysis), releasing oxygen as a byproduct.  The Calvin cycle, occurring in the stroma, utilizes the ATP and NADPH generated to fix atmospheric CO2 into organic molecules, primarily glucose, via a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  Variations exist, such as C4 and CAM photosynthesis, adaptations in plants thriving in arid or high-light environments, showcasing the evolutionary diversity of photosynthetic mechanisms.  Ongoing research focuses on optimizing photosynthetic efficiency for biofuel production and enhancing crop yields.
