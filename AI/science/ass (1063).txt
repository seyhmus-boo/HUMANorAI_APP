Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.  Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel, the core's outward pressure diminishes, initiating a catastrophic implosion.  The ensuing collapse is characterized by increasingly intense gravitational forces, overcoming degeneracy pressure and ultimately exceeding the Schwarzschild radius. This event horizon marks the point of no return, beyond which even light cannot escape.  The precise mechanism of collapse is complex, influenced by the star's initial mass, metallicity, and angular momentum, leading to variations in the final black hole's mass and spin.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, are hypothesized to form via several pathways including the direct collapse of supermassive stars, runaway mergers of stellar-mass black holes, or through a process of accretion and hierarchical mergers of smaller black holes within dense stellar environments.  Further research into the interplay of these mechanisms, particularly during the early universe, remains crucial for understanding the evolution of galaxies and the distribution of black holes across cosmic time.
