Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on catalysts in organic chemistry.  Imagine a mountain pass – a high-energy barrier between reactants (your starting point) and products (your destination).  Organic reactions often require surmounting this energetic hurdle.  Catalysts, however, act as skilled mountaineers, providing an alternative, lower-energy route. They don't alter the ultimate destination – the products formed remain the same – but dramatically reduce the energy needed to reach it, accelerating the reaction.

Think of a catalyst as a matchmaker: it brings the reactants together in a favourable orientation, facilitating bond breaking and formation. It forms temporary interactions with the reactants, forming an intermediate complex, before being released unchanged at the end, ready to facilitate another reaction.  Crucially, catalysts aren't consumed in the process, acting repeatedly.  Their impact is profound: they enable reactions to occur at lower temperatures, faster rates, and with increased selectivity, allowing for finer control over product formation, analogous to a skilled guide leading you safely and efficiently through challenging terrain.  Different catalysts can offer various routes, influencing product yield and purity.
