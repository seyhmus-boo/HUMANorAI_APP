CRISPR-Cas systems, initially identified as bacterial adaptive immune mechanisms, have revolutionized genetic engineering.  Prior to CRISPR, gene editing relied on less precise methods such as zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), which were costly and laborious to design and implement.  The discovery of CRISPR's ability to target and modify specific DNA sequences using a guide RNA molecule coupled with the Cas endonuclease, primarily Cas9, provided a transformative leap in precision and efficiency. This simplicity and versatility have enabled widespread adoption across diverse biological fields.

CRISPR-Cas9's mechanism involves guide RNA-directed targeting of a specific DNA sequence, followed by Cas9-mediated double-strand break induction.  Cellular repair mechanisms, either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) leading to insertions or deletions (indels), or homology-directed repair (HDR) using a provided DNA template, facilitate gene knockout or precise gene editing, respectively. Ongoing research focuses on enhancing specificity, minimizing off-target effects, and developing novel CRISPR-Cas systems with expanded targeting capabilities and functionalities, including base editing and prime editing.  The widespread application of CRISPR technology continues to reshape our ability to manipulate genomes for therapeutic purposes, agricultural improvement, and fundamental biological research.
