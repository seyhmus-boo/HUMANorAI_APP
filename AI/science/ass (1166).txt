The concept of chemical bonding, explaining the attractive forces holding atoms together in molecules, emerged gradually.  Early atomic theories, while acknowledging the existence of atoms, lacked a mechanism for their cohesion.  The advent of quantum mechanics revolutionized the field, providing a theoretical framework for understanding bonding through the sharing or transfer of electrons.  The Lewis model, based on the octet rule, offered a simplistic yet powerful depiction of covalent bonding via shared electron pairs.  This was further elaborated by Valence Bond Theory (VBT), incorporating atomic orbital hybridization to explain molecular geometry.  Meanwhile, Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT) provided a more sophisticated, delocalized description of bonding using linear combinations of atomic orbitals.

Molecular structure, intimately linked to bonding, describes the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms within a molecule.  This arrangement dictates a molecule's physical and chemical properties.  VBT predicts molecular geometry based on the repulsion between electron pairs (VSEPR theory), while MOT provides insights into bond order and electron density distribution.  Understanding the interplay between bonding and molecular structure is crucial for predicting reactivity, properties, and ultimately, for designing molecules with specific functionalities.
