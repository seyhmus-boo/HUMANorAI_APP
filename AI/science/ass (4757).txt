Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient tool for genome editing. This review explores the mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas systems, focusing primarily on the widely utilized CRISPR-Cas9 system, and its applications across diverse fields.  While naturally occurring prokaryotic defense mechanisms against invading phages, CRISPR-Cas systems have been adapted for targeted genome manipulation in a wide range of organisms, from bacteria to mammals.  This adaptability stems from the system's programmable nature; a short guide RNA directs the Cas nuclease to a specific DNA sequence, enabling targeted gene disruption, insertion, or replacement.  We examine the advantages of CRISPR-Cas9 over previous gene editing technologies, highlighting its increased simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and precision. However, we also address the limitations and potential off-target effects, along with ongoing efforts to improve specificity and mitigate these challenges. Finally, this paper will discuss the ethical implications and future directions of CRISPR technology, particularly within the context of therapeutic applications, agricultural biotechnology, and synthetic biology.
