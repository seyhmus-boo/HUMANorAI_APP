Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, is a fundamental process underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry.  This process, typically initiated by neutron bombardment, releases a significant amount of energy primarily due to the mass defect between the parent nucleus and its fission products.  The energy released manifests as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and the emission of additional neutrons, leading to the possibility of chain reactions.  The specific fission products and their yields are dependent on the fissile nucleus and the incident neutron energy, with a broad distribution observed experimentally.  Understanding the underlying nuclear physics governing fission fragment mass and charge distributions is crucial for predicting reactor performance and waste management strategies.  Theoretical models, incorporating liquid drop and shell effects, provide insights into the fission process, although discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental data remain.  Continued research focusing on improving theoretical models and refining experimental measurements is essential for advancing nuclear reactor design, improving safety protocols, and developing strategies for effective nuclear waste management.
