Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary gene-editing technology transforming genetic engineering.  Prior to CRISPR, techniques like zinc finger nucleases and TALENs offered gene modification, but lacked the simplicity and efficiency of this newer system.  CRISPR, derived from a bacterial defense mechanism against viral infection, utilizes a guide RNA molecule to direct the Cas9 enzyme to a specific DNA sequence.  This targeted sequence is then cleaved, allowing for gene disruption or, with the addition of a DNA template, precise gene replacement or insertion.

The historical significance of CRISPR lies in its accessibility and affordability compared to predecessors.  This has democratized gene editing, leading to a rapid proliferation of research across diverse fields.  From correcting genetic defects in disease models to engineering crops with enhanced traits, CRISPR's potential applications are vast. However, ethical considerations surrounding germline editing and off-target effects remain significant challenges demanding careful consideration as the field continues to advance.  We will delve further into these aspects in subsequent lectures.
