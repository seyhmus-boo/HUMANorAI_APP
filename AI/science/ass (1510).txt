Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating phenomenon of quantum entanglement.  Imagine two coins, flipped simultaneously but sealed in separate boxes.  Classical physics dictates that each coin has a definite state – heads or tails – independent of the other, even before opening the boxes.  Entanglement, however, defies this intuition.

In the quantum realm, these "coins" can exist in a superposition, a probabilistic mixture of heads and tails, until measured.  Crucially, entangled particles are linked: if you open one box and find heads, you *instantly* know the other box contains tails, regardless of the spatial separation.  This isn't due to some hidden signal; the entangled particles share a correlated quantum state.  Consider it as a single system, existing across vast distances, rather than two independent entities.

This interconnectedness, a violation of classical locality, has profound implications for quantum computing and communication.  The instantaneous correlation, however, does not allow for faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of the measurement on one particle is random, precluding the transmission of information.  Nevertheless, the non-classical correlations inherent in entanglement form the bedrock of many emerging quantum technologies.
