The formation of black holes remains a central problem in astrophysics, with recent developments refining our understanding of this complex process.  While the classical picture involves the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, the precise mechanisms and progenitor characteristics are still debated.  Advances in numerical relativity have enabled more accurate simulations of stellar core collapse, revealing the crucial role of rotation and magnetic fields in the formation dynamics.  These simulations increasingly demonstrate the potential for jet launching and the ejection of significant amounts of mass, altering the final black hole mass and spin.

Observational constraints have also significantly improved.  Gravitational wave astronomy, through detections like those from binary black hole mergers by LIGO and Virgo, provides insights into the black hole mass distribution and spin. Electromagnetic counterparts associated with these events, although challenging to detect, offer complementary information on the progenitor systems and the surrounding environment.  Finally, the study of supermassive black hole formation continues to be an active area of research, with theories ranging from direct collapse of massive gas clouds to hierarchical mergers of stellar-mass black holes. These ongoing efforts, bridging theoretical modelling and observational data, are progressively illuminating the multifaceted pathways to black hole birth.
