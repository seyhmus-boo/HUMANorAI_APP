DNA replication, the fundamental process by which genetic information is duplicated, underpins the propagation of life.  This intricate molecular mechanism, meticulously orchestrated by a complex array of enzymes and proteins, ensures the faithful transmission of the genome from one generation to the next.  Understanding the intricacies of DNA replication is not merely an academic pursuit; it holds profound implications for numerous practical applications.  This paper will explore the key steps involved in DNA replication, focusing on the mechanisms of initiation, elongation, and termination, highlighting the roles of key enzymes such as DNA polymerase and helicase.  Furthermore, we will examine the fidelity mechanisms ensuring accuracy and the cellular processes involved in DNA repair, crucial for maintaining genomic integrity.  The practical implications of this knowledge are far-reaching, impacting areas such as medicine, biotechnology, and forensic science.  For instance, understanding replication errors is crucial for comprehending the origins of genetic mutations and their contribution to disease development. Moreover, the manipulation of DNA replication processes is pivotal in techniques such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) – a cornerstone of molecular biology – and gene therapy strategies aiming to correct genetic defects.  This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of DNA replication, emphasizing both its fundamental biological mechanisms and its significant contributions to various technological advancements.
