Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two lighter nuclei.  Imagine a meticulously balanced ball on a hilltop – this represents the unstable, large nucleus. A slight nudge, analogous to the absorption of a neutron, disrupts this balance. The ball rapidly rolls down the hill, releasing potential energy in the process. This "roll" represents the fission event, where the nucleus fragments into two smaller nuclei,  like the ball breaking into two smaller pieces upon reaching the bottom.

This descent isn't just a simple fall; it's a chaotic cascade.  The released energy manifests as kinetic energy of the daughter nuclei, akin to the speed of the two smaller ball fragments.  Crucially, this process also releases additional neutrons, analogous to the smaller ball fragments triggering an avalanche by colliding with other balls on the hillside. If sufficient fissile material is present – a critical mass – this neutron release leads to a chain reaction, a self-sustaining avalanche of fission events, releasing vast amounts of energy, much like a large-scale landslide.  Control of this chain reaction is paramount in nuclear reactors, achieved through neutron absorption mechanisms to prevent an uncontrolled escalation.
