Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, a fundamental process underpinning life's continuity.  Early understanding of heredity, predating the discovery of DNA's structure, hinted at a self-replicating mechanism.  However, it was Watson and Crick's 1953 model, revealing the double helix's complementary base pairing, that provided the crucial insight into *how* replication occurred.

The semi-conservative model, experimentally confirmed by Meselson and Stahl, posits that each daughter DNA molecule retains one parental strand. Replication begins at specific origins, where helicase unwinds the double helix, creating a replication fork.  DNA polymerase, the key enzyme, then synthesizes new strands by adding nucleotides complementary to the template strands. This process is facilitated by other enzymes, including primase (for RNA primer synthesis) and ligase (for joining Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand).  The meticulous accuracy of DNA replication, despite its inherent speed, is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing mutations.  We will delve deeper into the intricate molecular mechanisms in subsequent sessions.
