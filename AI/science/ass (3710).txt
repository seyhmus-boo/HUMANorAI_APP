Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission.  Imagine an atom's nucleus, specifically a heavy one like Uranium-235, as a delicately balanced, highly stressed bowling ball perched atop a precarious hill. This ball represents the nucleus, held together by the strong nuclear force, but also experiencing immense internal pressure.

Now, imagine a tiny marble – a neutron – rolling down the hill and striking the bowling ball. This impact, representing neutron bombardment, is sufficient to disrupt the delicate balance. The bowling ball, overwhelmed, doesn't simply move; it shatters spectacularly into two smaller bowling balls – fission fragments – releasing a burst of energy equivalent to the potential energy stored in the unstable initial configuration.  This energy release is akin to the conversion of a small fraction of the bowling ball's mass into immense kinetic energy.

Crucially, this shattering also releases more marbles – additional neutrons – further rolling down the hill, potentially striking other precariously balanced bowling balls, initiating a chain reaction.  This chain reaction is the essence of sustained nuclear fission, a process we harness in nuclear power plants, but which, uncontrolled, can lead to catastrophic events.  Thus, controlling the “marble roll” is paramount in safe nuclear fission applications.
