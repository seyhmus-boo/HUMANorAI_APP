Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure.  Their extraordinary mechanical strength, high aspect ratio, and excellent electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, are theoretically well-established. However, experimental verification and exploitation of these properties present significant challenges.  Precise control over chirality during synthesis remains elusive, leading to heterogeneous samples with varying properties.  Characterizing individual nanotubes, especially concerning their structural and electronic characteristics, requires advanced microscopy techniques with limitations in resolution and throughput.  Furthermore, the strong van der Waals forces between nanotubes lead to bundle formation, hindering the realization of their full potential in applications requiring individual nanotube dispersion.  Finally, purifying CNTs to remove catalyst residues and amorphous carbon is a complex and energy-intensive process impacting scalability and cost-effectiveness.  Addressing these experimental hurdles is crucial for realizing the transformative potential of CNTs in various technological fields.
