Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, lies at the heart of numerous quantum technologies.  While the theoretical foundations of entanglement are well-established, realizing its full potential for applications like quantum computing and communication faces significant experimental hurdles. This paper explores the key experimental challenges associated with generating, manipulating, and verifying entangled states, particularly focusing on the fragility of entanglement to environmental noise and decoherence.  We will examine the limitations imposed by current technological capabilities in achieving high-fidelity entanglement generation, including limitations in control over individual quantum systems and the challenges of precise state preparation and measurement.  Furthermore, we will address the difficulties inherent in maintaining entanglement over long distances and the development of robust protocols for entanglement distribution and verification, including the impact of channel noise and imperfections in quantum repeaters.  Finally, we discuss emerging strategies to overcome these obstacles, emphasizing the ongoing quest for scalable and robust entanglement-based technologies.
