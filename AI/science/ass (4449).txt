Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional material properties rendering them attractive for a wide range of applications. This presentation will explore the key physical and chemical properties that underpin their potential.  We will examine the remarkable mechanical strength and stiffness of CNTs, arising from their strong covalent bonding and unique structural arrangement,  comparing their tensile strength to that of steel and their Young's modulus to that of diamond.  The exceptional electrical conductivity of CNTs, dependent on chirality and diameter, will be discussed, highlighting their potential in nanoelectronics and energy storage devices.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the significant thermal conductivity of CNTs, superior to many conventional materials, and their unique optical properties, including strong absorption in the near-infrared region.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the challenges associated with CNT production, purification, and functionalization,  emphasizing the ongoing research aimed at overcoming these limitations and unlocking the full potential of these remarkable nanomaterials for applications spanning electronics, composites, and medicine.
