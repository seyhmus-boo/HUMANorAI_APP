Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, defies classical intuition by exhibiting correlations between spatially separated quantum systems exceeding any classical explanation. This presentation provides a concise overview of entanglement from a fundamentally quantum mechanical perspective.  We will begin by defining entanglement through the lens of composite quantum systems and their associated Hilbert spaces, emphasizing the crucial role of superposition and the violation of Bell inequalities.  The mathematical formalism will be introduced, focusing on entangled states such as Bell states and their properties. We will discuss how entanglement arises from the inherently non-local nature of quantum mechanics, highlighting the contrast with classical correlations arising from shared past interactions.  The presentation will further explore the crucial role of entanglement in quantum information science, including its application in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation. Finally, we will briefly discuss open questions and ongoing research in understanding the fundamental nature of entanglement and its potential applications beyond the current technological landscape.
