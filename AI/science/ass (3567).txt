Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into smaller nuclei, releasing a tremendous amount of energy.  Imagine a meticulously balanced stack of dominoes: the nucleus represents this precarious structure.  A neutron, acting like a precisely placed nudge, initiates the process. This "nudge" disrupts the delicate balance, causing the nucleus to undergo fission. The resulting smaller nuclei are analogous to the dominoes falling in a chain reaction –  the released energy and neutrons become the cascading effect, causing further nuclei to split.

This chain reaction is self-sustaining, provided a critical mass of fissile material is present.  Think of it like a wildfire – a small spark (a single neutron) can only ignite a limited number of trees (nuclei) unless sufficient fuel (fissile material) exists for the flames to spread rapidly.  The energy released during fission is a consequence of the mass defect – the mass of the products is slightly less than the original nucleus, with this "missing" mass converted into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation E=mc².  This enormous energy release, far exceeding that of chemical reactions, is harnessed in nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons, but careful control of the chain reaction is crucial to prevent runaway fission.  Different isotopes and varying neutron energies influence the efficiency and nature of this crucial process.
