DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning life, remains a vibrant area of research. This presentation will provide a concise overview of this crucial cellular mechanism, highlighting recent advancements in our understanding. We will briefly revisit the established semiconservative model and core enzymatic machinery, including DNA polymerases, helicases, and primases.  However, the focus will be on recent breakthroughs.  These include enhanced understanding of the intricate interplay between replication and chromatin structure, particularly regarding the role of histone chaperones and modifications in facilitating efficient replication fork progression.  Furthermore, the presentation will delve into emerging findings concerning the mechanisms of replication stress response and its implications in genomic instability and disease.  Advances in single-molecule techniques and advanced imaging modalities are revealing unprecedented detail about replication dynamics *in vivo*, challenging previous models and opening avenues for novel therapeutic interventions targeting replication-associated diseases, such as cancer.  Finally, the discussion will briefly touch upon the ongoing efforts to develop improved methods for replicating synthetic DNA sequences for applications in biotechnology and synthetic biology.
