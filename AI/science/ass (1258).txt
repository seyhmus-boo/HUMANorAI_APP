DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating the genome, remains a central area of biological investigation.  The canonical model, involving unwinding by helicases, primer synthesis by primases, leading and lagging strand synthesis by DNA polymerases, and ligation by ligases, provides a robust framework.  However, recent research has significantly refined our understanding.  High-resolution structural studies, including cryo-EM, have elucidated the intricate dynamics of the replisome, revealing dynamic interactions between polymerase complexes and accessory proteins involved in proofreading and processivity.  Furthermore, investigations into the replication of challenging genomic regions, such as highly repetitive sequences or regions with secondary structures, have highlighted the role of specialized replication machinery and the intricate mechanisms employed to overcome replication stress.  Recent work exploring the impact of epigenetic modifications on replication timing and fidelity adds another layer of complexity.  Finally, advancements in single-molecule techniques offer unprecedented insights into the real-time dynamics of DNA replication forks, allowing for the detailed characterization of replication speed, pausing, and restart mechanisms. These advancements continue to unravel the complexities of this fundamental biological process, contributing significantly to our understanding of genome stability and its implications for disease.
