Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  Imagine a single sheet of graphite, a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms, rolled into a seamless cylinder. This, in essence, is a single-walled CNT (SWCNT).  Their cylindrical structure, along with the strong sp² hybridised carbon bonds, results in exceptional tensile strength – think of a steel cable, but far lighter and stronger.  Their high aspect ratio, like incredibly long and thin needles, leads to excellent electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic conductors or semiconductors depending on their chirality (the way the sheet is rolled), analogous to a switch.  Furthermore, their high surface area, like a highly porous sponge, makes them ideal for applications in energy storage and catalysis.  Finally, their thermal conductivity is exceptionally high, comparable to diamond, efficiently dissipating heat like a highly effective heat sink.  These extraordinary properties render CNTs promising materials across diverse fields.
