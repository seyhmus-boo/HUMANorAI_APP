Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating process of black hole formation.  Imagine a massive star, a celestial behemoth many times larger than our sun.  Fuelled by nuclear fusion, it lives a relatively short, yet vibrant, life.  Think of this fusion as a controlled explosion, counteracting the star's immense gravity.  However, this fuel eventually depletes.

When the star runs out of fuel, its own gravity takes over in a dramatic fashion.  Picture a deflated balloon: the star collapses in on itself, its outer layers imploding inwards.  For stars exceeding a critical mass, this collapse is unstoppable.  The core compresses to an incredibly dense point, a singularity, possessing such intense gravity that not even light can escape its grasp.  This singularity, surrounded by its event horizon – the point of no return – is what we define as a black hole.  The remaining stellar material is either ejected violently in a supernova explosion or accreted onto the black hole, further increasing its mass.  Thus, a black hole is the ultimate endpoint for sufficiently massive stars, a celestial graveyard born from the ashes of a dying giant.
