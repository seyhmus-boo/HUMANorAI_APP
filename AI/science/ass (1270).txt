Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, the fundamental process by which a cell duplicates its genome.  Imagine DNA as a zip file containing all the instructions for building and maintaining an organism.  Replication is akin to making an exact copy of this file.  The process begins with the "unzipping" of the double helix â€“ the two strands separating, thanks to enzymes like helicases.  Each strand now serves as a template.

Think of this template as a stencil.  Using the rules of base pairing (A with T, and G with C),  DNA polymerase, our "copying machine," adds complementary nucleotides, building a new strand alongside each original. This occurs simultaneously on both strands, in a semi-conservative manner; each new DNA molecule retains one original strand and one newly synthesized strand. This ensures accuracy and safeguards against errors.  The process concludes with proofreading and ligation, akin to checking for typos and binding the copied files together.  The result: two identical DNA molecules, ready for cell division.  This precise duplication is crucial for maintaining genetic integrity and enabling cellular proliferation.
