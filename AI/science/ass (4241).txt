Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy.  Imagine a highly unstable, tightly wound spring representing the nucleus.  This spring, due to its inherent instability (strong nuclear force countered by electromagnetic repulsion), is primed to release enormous potential energy.  Introducing a neutron, akin to striking the spring with a hammer, triggers this release.  The spring violently unwinds (fission), fracturing into smaller, more stable springs (daughter nuclei) and releasing stored energy as kinetic energy of the fragments and emitted neutrons.  

These emitted neutrons, acting like further hammers, can then trigger a chain reaction, where each fission event spawns further fissions, leading to an exponential increase in energy release, similar to a domino effect. This uncontrolled chain reaction is characteristic of nuclear weapons.  However, in nuclear reactors, control rods, analogous to dampers absorbing the hammer blows, regulate the neutron flux, maintaining a controlled, sustained chain reaction to generate power.  The energy released manifests as heat, subsequently used to generate electricity.  Crucially, the mass of the products is less than the original nucleus, with the 'missing' mass converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².
