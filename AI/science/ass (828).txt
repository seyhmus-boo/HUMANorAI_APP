Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic chemistry, enabling the efficient and selective synthesis of complex molecules. This presentation will provide an overview of the diverse roles catalysts play in organic transformations, highlighting recent advancements and future directions. We will examine various catalytic strategies, including homogeneous catalysis (e.g., transition metal complexes, organocatalysis), heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., zeolites, metal nanoparticles), and biocatalysis (e.g., enzymes).  Emphasis will be placed on the mechanisms of action, with specific examples illustrating the impact of catalyst design on reaction selectivity, yield, and sustainability.  The discussion will encompass a range of important organic reactions, such as C-C bond formation, oxidation, reduction, and asymmetric catalysis.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the crucial role of catalysts in addressing current challenges in organic synthesis, including the development of greener and more environmentally benign methodologies, the synthesis of complex natural products, and the production of pharmaceuticals.  Finally, emerging trends in catalyst development, such as the use of artificial intelligence in catalyst design and the exploration of novel catalytic materials, will be briefly discussed.
