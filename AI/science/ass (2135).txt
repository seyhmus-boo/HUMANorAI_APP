Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The valence electrons of atoms, described by atomic orbitals, interact to form molecular orbitals, a consequence of the superposition principle.  These molecular orbitals encompass the entire molecule, leading to electron delocalization and influencing molecular geometry.  The Aufbau principle and Hund's rule, adapted for molecular systems, dictate the filling of molecular orbitals with electrons, determining bond order and stability.  Different bonding theories offer varying degrees of approximation: Valence Bond Theory (VBT) describes bonding through orbital overlap, resulting in localized bonds; while Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT) generates delocalized molecular orbitals through linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO).  MOT, although computationally more demanding, provides a more comprehensive description of phenomena such as resonance and aromaticity, accurately predicting magnetic properties.  The strength and length of a chemical bond are directly correlated to the electron density within the bonding molecular orbital, quantifiable through techniques such as Density Functional Theory (DFT). Ultimately, the interplay between electron-electron repulsion and the attractive forces between electrons and nuclei determines the equilibrium structure and stability of a molecule, explained through energy minimization principles.
