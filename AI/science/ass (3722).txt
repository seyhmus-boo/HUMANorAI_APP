This presentation provides a concise overview of chemical bonding and molecular structure through the lens of quantum mechanics.  We will explore how the fundamental principles of quantum theory, specifically the Schr√∂dinger equation and its solutions, underpin our understanding of molecular geometries and stability.  The presentation will focus on the valence bond (VB) and molecular orbital (MO) theories, contrasting their approaches to describing covalent bonding.  We will examine the construction of molecular orbitals from atomic orbitals, highlighting the concepts of bonding, antibonding, and non-bonding orbitals, and their influence on bond order and molecular properties.  Furthermore, the implications of hybridization for molecular geometry will be discussed, using examples such as methane and ethene.  Finally, we will briefly address the limitations of both VB and MO theories and touch upon advanced computational methods employed for modeling complex molecular systems. This presentation aims to provide a foundational understanding of how quantum mechanics provides a rigorous framework for interpreting and predicting chemical bonding and the resulting molecular structures.
