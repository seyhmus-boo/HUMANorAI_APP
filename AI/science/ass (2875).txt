Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation.  This correlation, exceeding classical predictions, was first highlighted by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in their 1935 paper, which paradoxically argued against the completeness of quantum mechanics.  Their thought experiment, involving entangled particles with correlated properties, showcased seemingly instantaneous influences violating locality.

Subsequent experimental work, notably the Bell inequalities tests beginning in the 1960s and continuing to the present day, confirmed the violation of Bell's theorem, definitively demonstrating the existence of entanglement.  These experiments disproved local realism, a cornerstone of classical physics.  While the implications of entanglement remain a subject of ongoing debate regarding interpretations of quantum mechanics, its practical applications are rapidly developing.  Quantum computing and quantum cryptography leverage entanglement for enhanced computational power and secure communication, respectively. Despite its counterintuitive nature, entanglement's experimental verification solidifies its place as a fundamental and consequential aspect of the quantum world.
