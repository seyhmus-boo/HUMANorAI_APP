Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique sp²-hybridized carbon lattice.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile strength exceeding that of steel, is attributed to the strong covalent bonds within the graphitic structure.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, exhibiting metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality – the arrangement of carbon atoms within the tube.  This tunable conductivity is crucial for various applications.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to an extraordinarily high surface area, making them ideal for adsorption and catalysis applications.  Thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, exceeding that of most other materials, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  However, challenges remain in scalable production and precise control over chirality and diameter, which directly impact their properties and ultimate applications.  Further research focusing on these aspects is essential for realizing the full potential of CNTs in diverse technological domains.
