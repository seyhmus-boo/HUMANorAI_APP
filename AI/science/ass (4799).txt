Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic chemistry, enabling transformations that would otherwise be impractical or impossible. This presentation will provide an overview of the diverse roles catalysts play in facilitating efficient and selective organic reactions, emphasizing their crucial contribution to sustainable chemical synthesis. We will explore different catalyst classes, including homogeneous (e.g., transition metal complexes, organocatalysts) and heterogeneous (e.g., zeolites, metal nanoparticles) catalysts, highlighting their respective advantages and limitations.  Specific examples will showcase how catalysts drive key reactions such as C-C bond formation, oxidation, and reduction, impacting various fields.  Practical applications will be discussed, including the asymmetric synthesis of pharmaceuticals, the development of sustainable polymer materials, and the design of efficient energy storage systems.  Furthermore, the presentation will touch upon current research trends focusing on catalyst design for enhanced activity, selectivity, and recyclability, ultimately contributing to greener and more economically viable chemical processes.  We will conclude by briefly examining future challenges and opportunities in catalyst development for addressing pressing global issues.
