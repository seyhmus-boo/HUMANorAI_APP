Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a pivotal process in energy production and scientific research. This review summarizes the fundamental principles governing fission, focusing on the crucial role of neutron interactions and the resulting chain reaction.  The energy release mechanism, driven by the strong nuclear force and mass defect, is discussed, highlighting its dependence on isotopic composition and neutron energy.  Different fissionable materials, including uranium-235 and plutonium-239, are compared in terms of their fission cross-sections and neutron yield.  Moreover, the review addresses criticality conditions, emphasizing the importance of neutron moderation and control in reactor design.  Challenges associated with nuclear fission, such as radioactive waste management and nuclear proliferation, are acknowledged.  Finally,  ongoing research into advanced reactor designs, aimed at enhancing efficiency and safety, and the potential for thorium-based fuel cycles, are briefly explored.  This overview provides a concise yet comprehensive introduction to the multifaceted nature of nuclear fission processes and their enduring significance in various technological applications.
