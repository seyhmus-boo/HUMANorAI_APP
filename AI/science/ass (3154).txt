Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is a process underpinned by the interplay of strong and electromagnetic forces.  This exothermic reaction releases a significant amount of energy, primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and prompt neutrons.  The mass defect, governed by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²), accounts for the substantial energy yield.  Fission is typically induced by neutron bombardment, with specific isotopes like Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239 exhibiting high fissile capabilities.  The process is characterized by a chain reaction, where the emitted neutrons trigger further fission events, leading to exponential energy release.  Control of this chain reaction is crucial in nuclear reactors, achieved through neutron moderators and control rods that regulate neutron flux.  However, uncontrolled chain reactions form the basis of nuclear weapons.  The fission process also generates radioactive fission products, posing significant challenges in nuclear waste management due to their long half-lives and high radioactivity.  Ongoing research focuses on advanced reactor designs aimed at improving efficiency, safety, and waste reduction.
