Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them attractive for a wide range of applications. This presentation will explore the fundamental properties governing CNT behavior, focusing on the interplay between structure and functionality.  We will discuss the impact of chirality and diameter on electronic properties, differentiating between metallic and semiconducting CNTs and their implications for nanoelectronics.  The exceptional tensile strength and Young's modulus of CNTs, exceeding those of steel, will be examined, along with their implications for advanced composite materials. Furthermore, the superior thermal conductivity of CNTs, enabling efficient heat dissipation, will be highlighted.  The presentation will also briefly address the challenges associated with CNT production, purification, and functionalization, emphasizing the need for scalable and cost-effective methods for realizing their full potential across diverse fields such as energy storage, sensing, and biomedical applications.  Finally, we will discuss emerging research directions focusing on harnessing the unique properties of CNTs for next-generation technologies.
