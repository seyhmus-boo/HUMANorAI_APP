Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two or more lighter nuclei.  This process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the nucleus to become unstable and subsequently fission.  The resulting daughter nuclei possess significantly lower mass than the parent nucleus; this mass difference is converted into a tremendous amount of energy, according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  Furthermore, the fission process releases additional neutrons, which can trigger further fission events in a chain reaction. This chain reaction is the basis for nuclear power generation.

Practical applications of nuclear fission are primarily centered around energy production.  Nuclear power plants utilize controlled chain reactions within reactors to generate heat, which is then used to produce steam and drive turbines for electricity generation.  Beyond power generation, fission plays a role in medical applications, such as radioisotope production for diagnostic imaging and radiotherapy.  Furthermore, while less common now, nuclear fission has been utilized in the creation of nuclear weapons, though this application is subject to stringent international control and ethical debate.  The inherent risks associated with radioactive waste and potential for accidents, however, necessitate rigorous safety protocols in all applications of nuclear fission technology.
