The understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure, central to modern chemistry, evolved significantly throughout the 20th century. Early attempts, such as the Lewis model based on electron sharing and octet rule, provided a rudimentary framework for predicting bonding in simple molecules.  However, the limitations of this approach became apparent when confronted with complex molecules and exceptions to the octet rule.  Subsequently, the development of quantum mechanics revolutionized the field, offering a more rigorous description of bonding through molecular orbital theory (MOT) and valence bond theory (VBT).  MOT, which considers delocalized electrons across the entire molecule, provides a powerful explanation for phenomena like resonance and aromaticity, whereas VBT emphasizes localized electron pairs forming bonds between specific atoms. These theories, while differing in approach, ultimately aim to describe the distribution of electrons within a molecule, directly influencing its geometry, reactivity, and physical properties.  The interplay between bonding and molecular structure remains a key focus in contemporary chemical research, with computational techniques increasingly employed to model and predict the properties of increasingly complex systems.  Understanding this relationship is critical for the design and synthesis of novel materials with desired functionalities.
