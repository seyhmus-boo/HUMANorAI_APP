While classical mechanics adequately describes the overall process of DNA replication, a quantum mechanical perspective offers a nuanced understanding of crucial steps.  The fidelity of DNA replication, astonishingly high despite the inherent thermal noise, hinges on quantum tunnelling effects.  Specifically, the proton transfer involved in tautomerization of nucleotide bases, a significant source of replication errors, can occur via quantum tunnelling, bypassing the high-energy activation barrier predicted by classical models.  This tunnelling phenomenon, governed by the Schr√∂dinger equation, influences the rate of these mutations and explains the observed error rates, which are significantly lower than classical predictions.  Furthermore, the precise alignment of nucleotides during replication involves subtle electrostatic interactions that are subject to quantum fluctuations.  These fluctuations, while generally small, can influence the efficiency and specificity of base pairing, further highlighting the subtle yet significant influence of quantum mechanics on this fundamental biological process.  Investigating these quantum effects provides a deeper understanding of the extraordinary accuracy and efficiency of DNA replication.
