DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating the genome, presents significant experimental challenges.  Accurate replication requires precise unwinding of the double helix, primer synthesis, and coordinated action of DNA polymerases.  Studying these processes in vivo is hindered by the complexity of cellular machinery and the dynamic nature of the replication fork.  Isolation of individual components for in vitro analysis, while providing mechanistic insight, risks disruption of crucial interactions.

Furthermore, the sheer length of eukaryotic genomes poses a formidable challenge.  Replicating long DNA molecules in a controlled manner remains technically demanding, and accurate analysis requires sophisticated techniques like next-generation sequencing to assess replication fidelity and identify errors.  The high processivity of polymerases also necessitates methods for visualizing and quantifying replication dynamics in real-time, which is often achieved through indirect approaches that may lack direct observation of the replication process.  Finally, resolving the intricate interplay between leading and lagging strand synthesis and their associated enzymes presents ongoing hurdles in achieving a complete understanding of this fundamental biological process.
