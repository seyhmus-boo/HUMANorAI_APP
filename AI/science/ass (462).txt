The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp²-hybridized carbon atoms form a seamless cylindrical lattice, a rolled-up graphene sheet.  This unique geometry leads to strong covalent bonding within the hexagonal network, resulting in high tensile strength and stiffness.  Crucially, the electronic structure, dictated by the nanotube's chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's roll), determines its electrical conductivity.  Armchair nanotubes exhibit metallic conductivity due to a band structure with zero band gap at the Fermi level, arising from the symmetry of their lattice.  Zigzag and chiral nanotubes, however, can be either metallic or semiconducting, depending on their chirality-induced band gap. This remarkable tunability is a consequence of quantum confinement effects, where the nanotube's diameter restricts electron motion, altering energy levels and band structure.  Further, the π-electrons delocalized across the nanotube surface contribute to their exceptional thermal conductivity and electron mobility.  Thus, the remarkable properties of CNTs are a direct consequence of the interplay between their quantum mechanical structure, bonding, and dimensionality.
