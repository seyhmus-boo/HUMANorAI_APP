Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, possess exceptional properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of sp² hybridized carbon atoms.  These properties have spurred intense research interest across diverse scientific fields.  Their high aspect ratio, coupled with strong covalent bonding, results in exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, exceeding that of steel.  Remarkably, CNTs exhibit high tensile strength and elasticity, making them suitable for advanced composite materials.  

Furthermore, CNTs display remarkable electrical conductivity, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality – the arrangement of hexagons in their lattice.  This tunable conductivity underpins their potential in nanoelectronics and sensing applications.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, while their large surface area provides exceptional adsorption capabilities, crucial for applications in catalysis, energy storage, and environmental remediation.  However, challenges remain, including controlling the precise synthesis of CNTs with desired chirality and overcoming difficulties in large-scale, cost-effective production and dispersion.  Despite these challenges, the exceptional properties of CNTs continue to drive research towards realizing their immense potential in a wide array of technological advancements.
