Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a class of allotropes exhibiting exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms.  These structures, categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) based on the number of concentric graphitic layers, exhibit remarkable tensile strength exceeding that of steel, coupled with exceptional flexibility.  Their electrical properties are highly dependent on chirality, with SWNTs displaying either metallic or semiconducting behavior, offering potential for nanoelectronics applications.  MWNTs generally exhibit higher thermal conductivity than SWNTs, facilitating heat dissipation in various devices.  However, challenges remain, including controlled synthesis to achieve desired chirality distributions and the effective dispersion of CNTs in matrices for composite material applications.  Ongoing research focuses on exploring their potential in diverse fields ranging from advanced composites and energy storage to biomedical applications, driven by the continuing quest to fully exploit their exceptional properties and overcome existing limitations.
