Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, remains a pivotal process with far-reaching implications across scientific and technological domains. This presentation will provide a concise overview of the fundamental principles governing fission reactions, focusing on the crucial role of neutron interactions and the resulting energy release.  We will explore the various fissionable isotopes, highlighting their differing properties and applications.  Key concepts such as criticality, chain reactions, and neutron moderation will be discussed, emphasizing their importance in reactor design and control.

The presentation will then delve into the practical applications of nuclear fission, concentrating on its dominant role in electricity generation. We will examine the different reactor designs currently in operation, contrasting their advantages and disadvantages in terms of safety, efficiency, and waste management.  Beyond power generation, we will briefly touch upon other applications of fission, including the production of medical isotopes for diagnosis and treatment, as well as their role in scientific research, such as neutron scattering techniques.  Finally, the presentation will acknowledge the challenges associated with nuclear waste disposal and the ongoing efforts to develop safer and more sustainable nuclear technologies.
