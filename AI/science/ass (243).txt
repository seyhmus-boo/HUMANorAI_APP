Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars.  When a star, many times the mass of our sun, exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core can no longer withstand the immense inward gravitational pressure. This leads to a catastrophic implosion, compressing matter into an infinitesimally small volume with infinite density â€“ a singularity.  The surrounding spacetime is warped to such an extent that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravitational pull beyond a critical radius known as the event horizon.

Different stellar masses result in varying black hole sizes, and the process can also involve the merger of neutron stars or direct collapse of massive gas clouds.  Although directly observing a black hole is impossible, we infer their existence through observational evidence like gravitational lensing, the accretion of matter producing X-ray emissions, and the detection of gravitational waves emanating from merging black holes.  The practical applications of this research include advancing our understanding of gravity, cosmology, and testing Einstein's theory of general relativity.  Furthermore, studying black holes contributes significantly to the development of advanced technologies such as gravitational wave detectors, benefiting fields far beyond astrophysics.
