Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, have emerged as a subject of intense interdisciplinary research.  Their unique characteristics, stemming from their nanoscale dimensions and spÂ² hybridized carbon structure, hold immense potential across diverse fields. This paper explores the multifaceted properties of CNTs, highlighting their interdisciplinary relevance.  We will examine their mechanical strength and flexibility, crucial for advanced materials engineering and nanocomposites.  Furthermore, their electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, makes them vital components in electronics and sensor technologies.  The exceptional thermal conductivity of CNTs offers significant applications in thermal management systems and energy storage devices.  However, challenges remain, particularly concerning scalable production methods, efficient dispersion in matrices, and toxicity concerns.  This review will synthesize knowledge from materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering to comprehensively address these aspects, emphasizing the interconnections between these disciplines and the future directions of CNT research, focusing on applications that necessitate a multidisciplinary approach for successful development and implementation.
