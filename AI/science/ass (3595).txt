Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, exhibiting correlated behaviour regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation transcends classical physics, where separate objects maintain independent states.  Imagine two coins flipped simultaneously, but instead of landing on heads or tails independently, they always show opposite results: one heads, one tails.  This perfect anti-correlation, however distant the coins, mirrors the entangled state.

Crucially, the outcome of measuring one particle's property instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the entangled partner, even if they're light-years apart. This doesn't imply faster-than-light communication, as the outcome for each particle is probabilistic before measurement; the correlation only becomes apparent upon observation.  Another analogy is linked gloves in separate boxes: you only know the handedness of one glove upon opening its box; simultaneously, you know the other box contains its pair, without having looked inside. Entanglement's counter-intuitive nature challenges our classical understanding of locality and realism.
