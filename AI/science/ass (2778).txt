Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature.  Fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, is fundamentally a nuclear physics phenomenon governed by the strong and weak nuclear forces.  However, its impact extends far beyond this realm.  The release of enormous energy during fission – a consequence of Einstein's mass-energy equivalence – is central to the engineering challenges of reactor design and safety.  Materials science plays a crucial role, demanding the development of radiation-resistant alloys and fuel assemblies capable of withstanding extreme temperatures and pressures.  Furthermore, the byproduct of fission, radioactive waste, necessitates the input of chemists and geologists in developing safe storage and disposal strategies, considering long-term environmental impacts.  Finally, the socio-political implications of nuclear energy, encompassing energy security, proliferation concerns, and public perception, fall squarely within the domain of political science and sociology.  Thus, understanding nuclear fission necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, drawing expertise from various scientific and social fields.
