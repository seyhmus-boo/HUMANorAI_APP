DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating the genome, is fundamental to life.  The classic model, elucidated by Meselson and Stahl, posits the unwinding of the double helix at replication forks, followed by leading and lagging strand synthesis by DNA polymerase.  Recent developments refine this understanding.  High-throughput sequencing technologies have revealed the intricate choreography of replication timing and origin firing, revealing complex spatiotemporal regulation.  Furthermore, studies illuminate the roles of accessory proteins, such as helicases and topoisomerases, in resolving topological challenges posed by unwinding and supercoiling.  Advancements in cryo-electron microscopy offer unprecedented structural detail of the replisome, the multi-protein complex mediating replication.  Finally, understanding of the intricate error correction mechanisms, involving proofreading activity and mismatch repair pathways, has been enhanced, shedding light on the high fidelity of the process and its implications for mutagenesis and disease.  These advances significantly improve our comprehension of DNA replication's fidelity, regulation, and dynamics.
