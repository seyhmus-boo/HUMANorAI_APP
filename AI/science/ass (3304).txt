CRISPR-Cas systems, derived from prokaryotic adaptive immunity, have revolutionized genetic engineering. This lecture will overview the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9, the most widely utilized system.  The core components comprise a guide RNA (gRNA) specifying the target DNA sequence and the Cas9 nuclease, which induces a double-stranded break at the target locus. This break is then repaired by cellular mechanisms, either through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), leading to insertions or deletions (indels) and gene disruption, or homology-directed repair (HDR), enabling precise gene editing via the provision of a DNA template.  The lecture will further explore the advantages of CRISPR, including its simplicity, efficiency, and versatility, contrasting it with previous gene editing technologies such as TALENs and ZFNs.  However, we will also address the inherent limitations and ethical considerations associated with its application, including off-target effects, delivery challenges, and the potential for unintended consequences.  Finally, emerging CRISPR variants and applications, such as base editing and prime editing, offering enhanced precision and functionalities, will be discussed.
