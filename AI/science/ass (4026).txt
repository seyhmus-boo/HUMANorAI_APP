Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique one-dimensional structure composed of spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms arranged in cylindrical sheets.  These structures, categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), possess exceptionally high tensile strength, surpassing that of steel by several orders of magnitude, while maintaining remarkable flexibility.  Their electrical conductivity varies dramatically depending on chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, offering potential for diverse applications in electronics.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper, making them attractive for thermal management solutions.  Their large surface area contributes to superior adsorption capabilities, finding utility in gas storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT synthesis for precise chirality and achieving large-scale, cost-effective production of high-quality materials.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these hurdles to fully exploit the remarkable potential of CNTs in fields spanning materials science, nanotechnology, and energy applications.  This includes exploring their use in composites, sensors, and energy storage devices.
