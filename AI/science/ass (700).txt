Catalysts have profoundly impacted organic chemistry since its inception.  Early observations, such as the use of sulfuric acid in esterification reactions, predate a formal understanding of catalysis.  The development of transition metal catalysis, particularly in the 20th century, revolutionized the field.  These catalysts, often based on platinum group metals or other transition metals, facilitate reactions that are otherwise kinetically inaccessible under conventional conditions.

The mechanistic action of catalysts in organic chemistry involves the lowering of activation energy through the formation of intermediate complexes.  This interaction between catalyst and substrate provides alternative reaction pathways with lower energy barriers, thereby accelerating the rate of reaction without being consumed themselves.  The specific mechanism varies considerably depending on the catalyst and reaction type; examples include Lewis acid activation, redox catalysis, and metal-mediated bond formations.  The design and optimization of catalysts, often involving ligand modifications, remain crucial for achieving high selectivity and yield in modern organic synthesis.  The field continues to evolve, with considerable focus on sustainable and environmentally benign catalysts.
