Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, with ongoing research refining our understanding of the processes involved.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (â‰¥20 solar masses), following core-collapse supernovae.  Recent advancements in numerical relativity have significantly improved simulations of these events, elucidating the role of asymmetries and magnetic fields in the collapse dynamics and the resultant jet production.  The formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), residing at galactic centers, is less understood.  While direct collapse of massive gas clouds is a proposed mechanism, the rapid growth of SMBHs in the early universe presents a significant challenge.  Recent observations suggest a potential role for mergers of smaller black holes and sustained accretion from dense galactic environments.  Furthermore,  studies exploring the interplay between SMBH growth and galactic evolution through feedback mechanisms are gaining traction.  Improved observational capabilities, including gravitational wave detection and high-resolution imaging, are proving crucial in testing and refining theoretical models, pushing the boundaries of our comprehension of black hole formation across cosmic scales.
