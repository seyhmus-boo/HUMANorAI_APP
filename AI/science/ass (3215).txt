Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets forming cylindrical structures.  Their exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, exceeding that of steel, is a defining characteristic, coupled with high tensile strength and elasticity.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit remarkable electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality â€“ the angle of the graphene sheet's rolling. This tunable conductivity renders them highly promising for electronic applications.  Their thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, surpassing that of many metals, making them attractive for thermal management systems.  However, the practical utilization of CNTs faces challenges.  Challenges include their tendency to agglomerate, requiring effective dispersion techniques, and the difficulties in controlling their chirality and diameter during synthesis.  Despite these hurdles, the exceptional properties of CNTs continue to drive extensive research into their applications in diverse fields, including composites, electronics, sensors, and energy storage.  Further investigation into scalable, cost-effective synthesis methods and improved processing techniques remains crucial for realizing their full potential.
