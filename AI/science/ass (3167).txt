Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, is a process releasing vast amounts of energy. This energy liberation stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the fission products is less than the original nucleus, the difference being converted to energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  The process is initiated by neutron bombardment, typically of fissile isotopes like Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239.  A chain reaction is sustained through the release of further neutrons in each fission event, which can trigger subsequent fissions.  Control over this chain reaction is crucial, achieved through neutron moderators and control rods in nuclear reactors.  The primary practical application of nuclear fission is electricity generation in nuclear power plants, providing a significant, albeit controversial, source of baseload power globally.  Furthermore,  fission-generated neutrons find applications in material science, including neutron activation analysis and radiation therapy for cancer treatment.  However, the inherent risks associated with radioactive waste disposal and the potential for nuclear proliferation necessitate continuous research into improved reactor designs and waste management strategies.
