Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, sharing the same fate regardless of spatial separation.  Einstein famously derided this as "spooky action at a distance," highlighting its apparent violation of locality.  Early theoretical groundwork, laid by Schr√∂dinger and others in the 1930s, established the mathematical framework, but experimental verification remained elusive.  The EPR paradox, formulated by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen, challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics, arguing that entanglement implied hidden variables.

However, Bell's theorem (1964) provided a crucial theoretical framework for experimentally testing the predictions of quantum mechanics against those of local realism.  Subsequent experiments, beginning in the 1970s and continuing to this day with increasing sophistication, have overwhelmingly confirmed the predictions of quantum mechanics, decisively ruling out local hidden variable theories.  The implications of entanglement extend beyond fundamental physics, with active research exploring its potential applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation. While significant challenges remain, particularly in scaling up entangled systems, entanglement's profound implications for our understanding of reality continue to inspire ongoing investigation.
