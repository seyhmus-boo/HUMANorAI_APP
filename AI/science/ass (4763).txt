DNA replication, the precise duplication of the genome, is fundamental to life.  This presentation will provide an overview of the intricate molecular mechanisms underlying this process, focusing on the key enzymes and proteins involved. We will examine the semi-conservative nature of replication, highlighting the unwinding of the double helix by helicases, the stabilization of single-stranded DNA by single-stranded binding proteins, and the role of primase in initiating DNA synthesis.  The central role of DNA polymerases in adding nucleotides to the growing strand, respecting the 5' to 3' directionality, will be detailed, along with the differing roles of leading and lagging strand synthesis, including the formation and processing of Okazaki fragments.  Furthermore, the significance of proofreading mechanisms in maintaining genomic fidelity and the involvement of telomerase in replicating linear chromosomes will be discussed.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the regulation of DNA replication and its implications in cell cycle control and disease pathogenesis.  The aim is to provide a comprehensive yet concise understanding of this essential biological process.
