Black hole formation remains a complex and actively researched area in astrophysics. This review summarizes current understanding of the primary mechanisms, focusing on stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. Stellar-mass black holes, the endpoints of massive star evolution, arise from core-collapse supernovae.  Gravitational collapse models, while generally successful, require further refinement to address inconsistencies between observations and theoretical predictions, particularly concerning the detailed dynamics of the collapse and the role of magnetic fields. The formation pathways of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are less certain, with proposed mechanisms including direct collapse of massive gas clouds in early galaxies and the accretion and mergers of stellar-mass black holes.  Recent observations of SMBHs at high redshifts challenge traditional models, suggesting potentially faster growth mechanisms or earlier formation epochs than previously anticipated.  Ongoing advancements in observational techniques, such as gravitational wave astronomy and high-resolution imaging, are vital in testing competing models and unveiling the intricate processes driving black hole formation across cosmic timescales.  Future research should emphasize multi-messenger approaches to bridge the gap between theoretical models and observational data, thereby providing a more complete picture of black hole origins.
