Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 through transmission electron microscopy observations of arc-discharge generated carbon soot, exhibit a unique combination of properties stemming from their exceptional structure.  These cylindrical molecules, composed solely of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNTs), depending on the number of concentrically rolled graphene sheets.  Their remarkable mechanical properties include exceptionally high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, and significant elastic modulus, demonstrating remarkable resilience.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, varying from metallic to semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's rolling),  making them ideal components in nanoelectronics.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to substantial surface area, leading to applications in catalysis and energy storage.  Thermal conductivity is also notably high, exceeding that of many other materials, thus offering potential in thermal management applications.  However, the practical application of CNTs is often challenged by challenges in their production, purification, and dispersion, necessitating further research to fully harness their potential.
