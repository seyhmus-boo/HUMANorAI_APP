Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, remain a subject of intense research.  Their remarkable tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, coupled with low density, makes them attractive for advanced composites.  Recent developments focus on enhancing the control over CNT synthesis, yielding higher purity and more precisely defined structures.  This includes advances in catalytic growth techniques, enabling the production of single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) with specific chiralities and diameters, crucial for tailoring their electronic properties.

Electrically, CNTs exhibit unique behaviour, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on their chirality.  Recent work explores their application in high-performance transistors and flexible electronics, leveraging their ballistic electron transport properties.  Furthermore, their exceptional thermal conductivity makes them promising candidates for thermal management applications, with research now concentrating on integrating them into heat sinks and thermal interface materials.  While challenges remain in terms of scalability and cost-effective production, particularly for large-scale applications, recent progress in these areas promises to solidify CNTs' role in future technologies.
