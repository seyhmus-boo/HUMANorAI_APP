Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional physical and chemical properties that have garnered significant attention across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines.  This review explores the fundamental properties of CNTs, focusing on their unique structural characteristics and the resulting implications for their macroscopic behavior.  We examine the dependence of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity on key structural parameters such as diameter, chirality, and degree of structural defects.  The impact of these properties on applications in advanced composites, nanoelectronics, energy storage, and biomedical engineering will be discussed. While significant progress has been made in understanding and utilizing CNTs, challenges remain, particularly in terms of large-scale, cost-effective production, controlled synthesis with precise structural parameters, and the mitigation of toxicity concerns. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in CNT property characterization, highlighting recent advancements and future research directions aimed at harnessing the full potential of these remarkable nanomaterials.  A critical assessment of existing methodologies for property measurement and manipulation will be included, focusing on the discrepancies and limitations in current analytical techniques.
