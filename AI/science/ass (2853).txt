Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, constitutes a significant energy release mechanism.  This process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, typically by fissile isotopes such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239.  Neutron absorption induces an unstable nuclear configuration, leading to the nucleus's fission into two fission fragments, accompanied by the emission of additional neutrons and a substantial release of energy predominantly in the form of kinetic energy of the fragments and prompt gamma radiation.  The energy yield arises from the mass defect, the difference between the mass of the original nucleus and the sum of the masses of its fission products.  This mass difference is converted into energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  The emitted neutrons are crucial for sustaining a chain reaction, where each fission event triggers further fissions, maintaining the energy release.  Control of this chain reaction is paramount in nuclear reactors, achieved through the use of neutron moderators and control rods to regulate neutron flux.  The characteristics of fission products, including their radioactivity and decay heat, pose significant challenges in nuclear waste management.  Further research into advanced reactor designs aims to improve efficiency and mitigate the associated risks.
