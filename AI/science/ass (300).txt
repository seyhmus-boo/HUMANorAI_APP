Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms.  Their geometry, either single-walled (SWCNTs) or multi-walled (MWCNTs), dictates many of their characteristics.  CNTs exhibit extraordinary mechanical strength, with tensile strengths exceeding that of steel, and high Young's modulus, signifying exceptional stiffness.  Their electrical properties are highly dependent on chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, making them attractive for electronics applications.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper along the nanotube axis, and exhibit significant surface area, leading to applications in catalysis and energy storage.  However, challenges remain in achieving controlled synthesis of specific chiralities and efficient dispersion in composite materials.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these limitations to fully exploit the potential of CNTs in diverse fields, including advanced composites, electronics, energy technologies, and biomedical applications.
