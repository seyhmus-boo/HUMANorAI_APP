Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The stability of a molecule arises from the lowering of its total energy relative to its constituent atoms.  This energy reduction stems from the interaction of atomic orbitals, described by wavefunctions, to form molecular orbitals.  The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that only two electrons, with opposite spins, can occupy a single molecular orbital.

Constructive interference of atomic orbitals leads to bonding molecular orbitals, characterized by increased electron density between nuclei, resulting in attractive forces. Destructive interference generates antibonding orbitals, with reduced electron density between nuclei, contributing to repulsive forces. The distribution of electrons in these molecular orbitals dictates the molecule's geometry, minimizing electron-electron repulsion and maximizing electron-nuclear attraction.  This is often described using valence bond theory or molecular orbital theory, both ultimately rooted in the Schr√∂dinger equation and its solutions. The observed molecular geometry is the one that minimizes the total energy of the system.  Thus, the specific arrangement of atoms within a molecule is a direct consequence of quantum mechanical principles governing electron behavior.
