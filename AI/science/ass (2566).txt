The formation of black holes, enigmatic objects predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity, remains a central question in astrophysics.  While the theoretical framework is well-established, the precise mechanisms and astrophysical environments leading to their creation continue to be refined through observational advancements and sophisticated numerical simulations.  This paper explores the current understanding of black hole formation, focusing on recent developments that challenge and expand upon traditional models.  Specifically, we examine the role of stellar-mass black hole mergers detected by gravitational wave observatories like LIGO and Virgo, offering unprecedented insights into their progenitor systems and the late stages of stellar evolution.  Furthermore, we address the ongoing debate regarding the formation of supermassive black holes, considering the limitations of solely relying on stellar remnants and exploring alternative scenarios such as direct collapse or the accretion of massive gas clouds.  Advances in high-resolution simulations, coupled with increasingly detailed multi-wavelength observations, provide crucial data for disentangling these complex processes and constructing more accurate models of black hole formation across a vast range of masses. This research aims to synthesize these recent findings and highlight promising avenues for future investigation.
