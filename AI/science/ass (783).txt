Black hole formation remains a complex area of astrophysical research, primarily stemming from the collapse of massive stars or through galactic mergers.  Stellar-mass black holes arise when the core of a star exceeding approximately 20 solar masses exhausts its nuclear fuel, triggering gravitational collapse beyond the neutron star limit.  The precise mechanism, influenced by factors like rotation and magnetic fields, is still under investigation, with advanced simulations increasingly resolving the intricacies of core-collapse supernovae and their potential to produce black holes directly or through fallback accretion.

Recent developments emphasize the role of binary systems.  Gravitational wave observations by LIGO and Virgo have provided compelling evidence of black hole mergers, offering insights into the properties and population of stellar-mass black holes.  Furthermore, studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are refining our understanding of supermassive black hole formation, exploring scenarios including direct collapse of massive gas clouds and runaway mergers of smaller black holes.  Ongoing advancements in numerical relativity and multi-messenger astronomy promise further refinement of theoretical models and a more comprehensive understanding of this fundamental astrophysical process.
