Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  Early theoretical groundwork, stemming from John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace's 18th-century "dark star" concepts, lacked the framework of general relativity.  Einstein's theory, published in 1915, provided the necessary mathematical description of spacetime curvature, predicting the existence of singularities – regions of infinite density – where gravity's pull is inescapable.

The process begins with a massive star (typically >20 solar masses) exhausting its nuclear fuel.  The ensuing lack of outward pressure against gravity initiates core collapse.  If the core mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), even neutron degeneracy pressure, which supports neutron stars, is insufficient to prevent further collapse.  This results in the formation of a singularity, shrouded by an event horizon – a boundary beyond which even light cannot escape.  The resulting object, a black hole, is characterized by its mass, angular momentum, and electric charge, as dictated by the no-hair theorem.  Less massive stars ultimately form white dwarfs or neutron stars, demonstrating a crucial mass threshold for black hole genesis.
