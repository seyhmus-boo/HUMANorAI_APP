Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, culminates from the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars.  Early theoretical work by Laplace and Michell, predating Einstein's general relativity, proposed the existence of bodies so dense that light could not escape, laying the groundwork for the concept.  However, it was Einstein's theory that provided the robust framework for understanding black hole formation as a consequence of spacetime curvature.

The process begins with a star exceeding approximately 20 solar masses.  Upon exhausting its nuclear fuel, the star's core undergoes catastrophic collapse, overcoming electron and neutron degeneracy pressure.  This collapse, characterized by a runaway implosion, results in a singularity – a point of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  The specifics of the collapse depend on the star's initial mass and rotational properties, leading to variations in black hole mass and spin.  The surrounding stellar material may form an accretion disk, emitting intense radiation as it spirals inwards, observable phenomena that aid in black hole detection.  Further research focuses on clarifying the details of this complex process, particularly concerning the role of magnetic fields and the formation of supermassive black holes residing at galactic centers.
