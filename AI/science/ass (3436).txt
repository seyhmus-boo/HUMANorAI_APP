Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a cornerstone of both energy production and scientific inquiry. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental processes governing nuclear fission, focusing on the interplay between nuclear structure, reaction dynamics, and the resulting energy release.  We examine the key factors influencing fission probabilities, including the role of nuclear shape isomerism, neutron-induced fission cross-sections, and the impact of varying incident neutron energies.  Furthermore, the paper delves into the characteristics of fission fragments, exploring their mass and charge distributions, kinetic energies, and subsequent radioactive decay.  A critical analysis of theoretical models used to describe the fission process is presented, highlighting the strengths and limitations of current approaches, such as the liquid drop model and microscopic calculations.  Finally, we discuss the ongoing research aimed at refining our understanding of fission dynamics, particularly concerning the prediction of fission fragment yields and the development of advanced nuclear fuel cycles.  This review aims to provide a concise yet thorough overview of nuclear fission, its underlying principles, and its continuing relevance in numerous scientific and technological applications.
