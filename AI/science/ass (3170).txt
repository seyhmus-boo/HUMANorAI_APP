Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon network.  Their high aspect ratio and strong covalent bonding contribute to exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, surpassing that of steel.  Remarkably high tensile strength and Young's modulus values have been experimentally observed, making CNTs attractive for reinforcement in composite materials.  Electrical conductivity is strongly dependent on chirality;  armchair CNTs display metallic conductivity, while zigzag and chiral CNTs can exhibit semiconducting behaviour, offering potential for nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess significant thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper along the tube axis, due to efficient phonon transport.  Their large surface area also leads to notable adsorption capabilities, with potential applications in gas storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in controlling chirality during synthesis and achieving scalable, high-quality production for widespread technological implementation.  Future research should focus on overcoming these limitations to fully exploit the remarkable potential of CNTs.
