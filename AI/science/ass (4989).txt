DNA replication is the semiconservative process by which a cell creates an identical copy of its DNA molecule.  Imagine DNA as a ladder twisted into a spiral.  Each side of the ladder, the backbone, consists of sugar and phosphate molecules, while the rungs are formed by paired nucleotide bases (adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine).  Replication begins with the enzyme helicase "unzipping" the ladder, separating the two strands.  This creates replication forks, resembling the points where a zipper is partially open.

Each separated strand then serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.  Think of this as having half a ladder; a specialized enzyme, DNA polymerase, adds nucleotides to this half-ladder, following the base-pairing rules. This process is analogous to using a stencil to create a mirror image, ensuring each new DNA molecule contains one original strand and one newly synthesized strand â€“ hence the "semiconservative" nature. The process proceeds bidirectionally from each replication fork, rapidly creating two identical DNA molecules.  Finally, enzymes proofread and correct any errors, ensuring high fidelity in the replication process.
