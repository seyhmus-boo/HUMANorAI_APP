The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting gravitational forces so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape, remains a central problem in astrophysics.  Early theoretical explorations, originating with the work of John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the late 18th century, posited the existence of "dark stars" based on Newtonian gravity.  These prescient ideas, however, lacked the necessary relativistic framework for a complete understanding.  The advent of Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in 1915 provided the crucial theoretical foundation, with Karl Schwarzschild's solution to the field equations shortly thereafter describing the geometry surrounding a non-rotating, spherically symmetric black hole.  Subsequent decades witnessed significant advancements, including Oppenheimer and Snyder's seminal work on gravitational collapse (1939), demonstrating the theoretical plausibility of stellar black hole formation.

Despite these theoretical breakthroughs, observational confirmation remained elusive until the late 20th century. The identification of Cygnus X-1 as a strong candidate for a stellar-mass black hole marked a pivotal moment, paving the way for increasingly sophisticated observational techniques and theoretical modeling. This paper explores the diverse mechanisms underlying black hole formation, ranging from the collapse of massive stars to the mergers of supermassive black holes at galactic centers, examining the astrophysical conditions and processes governing their genesis and evolution.
