The macroscopic behaviour of plasmas, while often successfully described by classical magnetohydrodynamics, fundamentally arises from the quantum mechanical interactions of its constituent particles.  Quantum effects manifest in several crucial phenomena.  Firstly, the Pauli exclusion principle governs electron degeneracy pressure, significant in dense plasmas like those found in white dwarf stars, counteracting gravitational collapse and influencing the plasma's stability.  Secondly, quantum tunnelling plays a vital role in various processes including nuclear fusion reactions within stellar plasmas, enabling particles to overcome the Coulomb barrier even at energies below the classical threshold.  Furthermore, quantum electrodynamic (QED) effects, though often minor at low energy densities, become increasingly important at high temperatures and densities, influencing radiative processes and particle interactions through phenomena like vacuum polarization and the anomalous magnetic moment of electrons.  Finally, the discrete energy levels of atoms and ions within the plasma significantly impact the plasma's ionization state and radiative properties, determining the absorption and emission spectra crucial for diagnostics.  The accurate description of these quantum effects is critical for a complete understanding of plasma behaviour in extreme environments.
