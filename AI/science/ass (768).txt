Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructure, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized structure and high aspect ratio.  Their mechanical properties are remarkable, boasting tensile strengths exceeding those of steel and high Young's modulus, making them attractive for reinforcement in composites.  Electrically, CNTs can be either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality, offering potential for nanoelectronics and sensors.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, crucial for thermal management applications.

Recent developments focus on improving CNT synthesis for greater control over chirality and diameter distribution, essential for optimizing their electrical properties.  Advanced techniques like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) with precise catalyst control are leading to higher purity and more uniform CNT arrays.  Furthermore, research into functionalization strategies, including covalent and non-covalent modifications, is enabling improved dispersion in polymers and integration into complex devices.  These advancements are paving the way for applications in high-performance electronics, energy storage, biomedical devices, and advanced materials science.
