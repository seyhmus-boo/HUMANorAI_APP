DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning heredity and cellular proliferation, has captivated scientists since the elucidation of DNA's double helix structure.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of DNA replication, tracing its historical context from the initial conceptualization of a semi-conservative mechanism by Watson and Crick to the detailed molecular understanding achieved through decades of research.  We will explore the key players involved, including DNA polymerases, helicases, primases, and topoisomerases, highlighting their respective roles in initiating, elongating, and proofreading the newly synthesized strands. The intricate mechanisms of leading and lagging strand synthesis, along with the complexities of replication fork progression and termination, will be discussed.  Further, the presentation will touch upon the remarkable fidelity of DNA replication and the mechanisms that minimize errors, emphasizing the significance of this accuracy in maintaining genomic stability. Finally, we will briefly address current research into the regulation of DNA replication and its implications in disease pathogenesis, specifically highlighting the connection between replication stress and cancer development.  The presentation aims to provide a comprehensive yet accessible overview of this vital biological process.
