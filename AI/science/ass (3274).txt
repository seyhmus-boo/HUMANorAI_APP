DNA replication, the process by which a double-stranded DNA molecule produces two identical copies, is fundamental to life.  Early experiments, notably the Meselson-Stahl experiment in 1958, definitively demonstrated the semi-conservative nature of replication: each new DNA molecule retains one parental strand and incorporates one newly synthesized strand.  This process is orchestrated by a complex molecular machinery.

Initiation involves the unwinding of the double helix at specific origin sites by helicases, assisted by single-strand binding proteins that stabilize the separated strands.  DNA polymerase, the central enzyme, catalyzes the addition of deoxyribonucleotides to the 3'-hydroxyl end of the growing strand, synthesizing in a 5' to 3' direction.  Leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously, while lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously in Okazaki fragments, requiring primase for RNA primer synthesis and ligase for fragment joining.  Telomeres, repetitive sequences at chromosome ends, present a unique replication challenge, addressed by telomerase in certain cell types.  The high fidelity of DNA replication is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases and various repair pathways that address replication errors.  Errors that escape correction contribute to mutation rates, influencing evolution and disease.
