Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that underpin their diverse potential applications.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, surpassing those of steel, make them ideal for reinforcing composite materials, enhancing their durability and lightweight characteristics.  Electrically, CNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality, enabling their use in advanced electronics, such as high-frequency transistors and flexible displays.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation in microelectronics and thermal management systems.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit unique optical properties, including strong near-infrared absorption, making them promising candidates for biomedical applications like targeted drug delivery and photothermal therapy.  However, challenges remain in scalable production, controlled functionalization, and the mitigation of potential toxicity concerns.  Overcoming these hurdles will unlock the full potential of CNTs across a wide array of technological sectors, paving the way for next-generation materials and devices with superior performance.
