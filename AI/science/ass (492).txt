Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, underpins many promising quantum technologies.  However, realizing the full potential of entanglement faces significant experimental hurdles. This presentation will explore key challenges in generating, manipulating, and maintaining entangled states, focusing on experimental limitations. We will discuss the difficulties associated with achieving high fidelity entanglement generation, particularly in scaling up to larger numbers of entangled particles.  The fragility of entangled states to decoherence arising from environmental interactions will be highlighted, emphasizing the crucial role of noise reduction techniques such as dynamical decoupling and quantum error correction.  Furthermore, the complexities of efficient and high-fidelity state characterization and measurement, including the challenges associated with scalability and the development of novel detection methods, will be addressed.  Finally, we will briefly outline current and future approaches aimed at overcoming these experimental obstacles, paving the way for robust and scalable quantum technologies based on entangled states.
