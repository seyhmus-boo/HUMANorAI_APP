Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, the fundamental process by which cells create an identical copy of their DNA.  This semi-conservative process, meticulously elucidated by Meselson and Stahl, involves unwinding the double helix by helicases, creating a replication fork.  DNA polymerase then synthesizes new strands, utilising existing strands as templates, adding nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction.  Leading and lagging strands are synthesized concurrently, with the lagging strand requiring Okazaki fragments and ligase for joining.  High fidelity is ensured by proofreading mechanisms within DNA polymerase, minimising errors.  

The accurate replication of DNA is crucial for cell division and heredity.  Understanding this process has yielded significant practical applications.  PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction) technology, based on in vitro DNA replication, is ubiquitous in diagnostics, forensic science, and molecular biology research.  Furthermore, manipulating DNA replication through targeted gene editing techniques like CRISPR-Cas9 has revolutionised gene therapy and our ability to combat genetic diseases.  Therefore, a thorough grasp of DNA replication is essential for advancements in numerous scientific fields.
