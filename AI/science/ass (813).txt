Understanding chemical bonding and molecular structure is fundamental to chemistry.  Early theories, such as Kekul√©'s structural formulas in the 19th century, provided rudimentary models for covalent bonding, emphasizing the sharing of electron pairs.  However, these lacked the explanatory power to encompass diverse bonding scenarios. The advent of quantum mechanics revolutionized the field, with Lewis's octet rule providing a simplified yet valuable framework for predicting bonding in many main group elements.  Subsequent developments, including valence bond theory (VBT) and molecular orbital (MO) theory, offered more sophisticated explanations. VBT describes bonding through the overlap of atomic orbitals, forming localized bonds, while MO theory considers the combination of atomic orbitals to form delocalized molecular orbitals spanning the entire molecule.  These theories, while differing in approach, offer complementary perspectives on bond formation, strength, and molecular geometry.  Furthermore, concepts such as hybridisation help reconcile observed molecular shapes with theoretical predictions.  Modern computational methods allow for increasingly accurate predictions of molecular structures and properties, validating and extending our understanding of this crucial aspect of chemistry.
