Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridised structure.  Their remarkable tensile strength, exceeding that of steel by several orders of magnitude, coupled with high elasticity, makes them ideal candidates for advanced composites.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, varying from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, enabling applications in electronics and sensors.  High thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation.

Recent developments focus on enhancing the scalability and controllability of CNT synthesis.  Techniques like chemical vapor deposition (CVD) are being refined to achieve higher purity and alignment, crucial for macroscopic applications.  Furthermore, research is exploring functionalization strategies to improve CNT dispersion in polymers and tailor their interfacial properties for enhanced composite performance.  Progress in understanding and controlling their chirality allows for targeted synthesis of CNTs with specific electrical properties, opening avenues for novel nanoelectronics.  Overall, these advances are paving the way for the widespread implementation of CNTs across diverse technological sectors.
