Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, releases a significant amount of energy, underpinning the operation of nuclear power plants and the design of nuclear weapons.  The process typically involves bombarding a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with neutrons.  Neutron absorption initiates a chain reaction, as the resulting fission fragments release further neutrons, sustaining the process.  Control of this chain reaction is crucial in reactors, achieved through the use of neutron moderators and control rods. Recent developments in fission research focus on improving reactor efficiency and safety.  Advanced reactor designs, such as Generation IV reactors, aim for enhanced fuel utilization, improved waste management, and inherent safety features.  These designs explore diverse fuel cycles, including the use of thorium, which offers a potentially more sustainable and proliferation-resistant alternative to uranium. Furthermore, research into Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) is gaining traction, utilizing particle accelerators to control the fission process and potentially transmute long-lived radioactive waste, offering a path towards a more closed nuclear fuel cycle and reduced long-term environmental impact.  These advancements, while still at various stages of development, signify a concerted effort towards a more sustainable and secure future for nuclear fission technology.
