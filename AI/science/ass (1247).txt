Nuclear fission, the splitting of an atomic nucleus into smaller nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Its theoretical underpinnings were established through the work of scientists like Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, who interpreted the experimental results of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, demonstrating the fission of uranium.  This breakthrough, revealing the immense energy released during the process,  stemmed from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the fission products is less than the original nucleus. This mass difference is converted into energy, as famously described by Einstein's equation, E=mcÂ².

The fission process, typically induced by neutron bombardment of fissile isotopes like Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, is a chain reaction. Each fission event releases further neutrons, capable of inducing further fissions, leading to a rapid release of energy. This principle underlies both nuclear power generation and nuclear weaponry.  Control of the chain reaction, through neutron moderation and absorption, is crucial in nuclear reactors, whereas uncontrolled chain reactions characterize nuclear explosions. The subsequent development of these applications has profoundly shaped the 20th and 21st centuries.
