Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally explained by quantum mechanics, specifically through the interaction of electrons within the framework of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation.  This approximation separates nuclear and electronic motion, allowing for the calculation of electronic wavefunctions for fixed nuclear positions.  The resulting molecular orbitals (MOs), obtained via linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO), describe the probability distribution of electrons within the molecule.  Bond formation arises from the constructive interference of atomic orbitals, resulting in lower-energy bonding MOs that are populated by electrons, thereby stabilizing the system.  The Pauli exclusion principle dictates that only two electrons can occupy each MO with opposite spins.  Molecular geometry is dictated by the minimization of the total electronic energy, influenced by electron-electron repulsion and electron-nuclear attraction,  often explored through methods like Hartree-Fock and Density Functional Theory (DFT). The resulting spatial arrangement of atoms determines the molecule's physical and chemical properties, with different bonding types (e.g., covalent, ionic, metallic) manifesting distinct characteristics in their electron density distributions and orbital overlaps.  Advanced techniques like post-Hartree-Fock methods and multiconfigurational approaches address limitations of simpler models, providing a more accurate description of complex systems and bond phenomena.
