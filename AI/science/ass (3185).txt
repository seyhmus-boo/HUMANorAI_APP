Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This seemingly paradoxical behavior, where measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, was first predicted by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in their 1935 paper, which argued it demonstrated the incompleteness of quantum mechanics.  The EPR paradox highlighted the inherent non-locality of quantum entanglement, a feature that challenged classical intuitions of realism and locality.

Experimental verification of entanglement began decades later, with groundbreaking experiments in the late 20th century definitively demonstrating the violation of Bell's inequalities, thereby refuting local realism.  This cemented entanglement's status as a fundamental aspect of the quantum world.  Today, entanglement is not merely a curiosity but a crucial resource for emerging quantum technologies.  This presentation will offer a concise overview of the historical development of our understanding of entanglement, highlighting key theoretical and experimental milestones, and briefly discuss its contemporary applications in quantum computing, cryptography, and communication.
