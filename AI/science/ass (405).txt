DNA replication, a fundamental process in all living organisms, ensures the faithful duplication of the genome prior to cell division.  This semiconservative mechanism involves the unwinding of the parental double helix by helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-strand binding proteins (SSBs) stabilize the unwound strands, preventing premature re-annealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH terminus necessary for DNA polymerase III to initiate DNA synthesis.  This polymerase adds deoxyribonucleotides to the growing strand in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to the continuous synthesis of the leading strand and the discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand in Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase then seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, resulting in two complete, identical DNA molecules.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and various repair mechanisms that correct errors introduced during replication.  Disruptions to this intricate process can lead to mutations with potentially deleterious consequences.  Further research continues to elucidate the complexities of replication regulation and its impact on genome stability and cellular function.
