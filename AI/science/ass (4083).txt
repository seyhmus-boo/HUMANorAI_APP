Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei, remains a cornerstone of energy production and scientific research. This presentation provides a concise overview of fundamental fission processes, focusing on recent advancements that enhance our understanding and application.  We will initially review the underlying physics, including the role of neutron moderation and multiplication in sustaining chain reactions.  Key advancements in reactor design, such as the development of advanced fuels and improved coolant systems, will be discussed, highlighting their contributions to enhanced safety, efficiency, and waste reduction.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the burgeoning field of Accelerator Driven Subcritical Systems (ADS), emphasizing their potential for transmuting long-lived nuclear waste and improving fuel cycle sustainability.  Recent experimental and theoretical breakthroughs in characterizing fission fragment yields and neutron spectra will also be summarized, showcasing their impact on reactor physics simulations and the development of more accurate predictive models.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon ongoing research exploring innovative fission technologies, such as molten salt reactors, offering promising pathways towards next-generation nuclear energy systems.
