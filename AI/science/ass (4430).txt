Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysical research, bridging fundamental physics with large-scale cosmological structures.  This presentation will review the primary mechanisms proposed for stellar-mass and supermassive black hole formation, highlighting recent advancements and outstanding challenges.  We will examine the collapse of massive stars, focusing on the interplay between stellar evolution, rotation, and magnetic fields in determining the final fate of these objects.  The role of pair-instability supernovae and direct collapse scenarios in producing black holes exceeding 100 solar masses will be discussed.  Further, we will address the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), exploring scenarios such as direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe and the growth of seed black holes through accretion and mergers.  Recent observations from gravitational wave detectors and advancements in numerical simulations provide crucial constraints, informing our understanding of the diverse pathways to black hole formation.  Finally, we will briefly discuss future research directions, including the need for improved modelling of the complex hydrodynamical and radiative processes involved, and the importance of multi-messenger astronomy in unveiling the mysteries of black hole origins.
