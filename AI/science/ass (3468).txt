Black hole formation, while classically understood through gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, necessitates a quantum mechanical interpretation at its core.  The classical picture breaks down at the singularity, where densities approach infinity and general relativity becomes insufficient.  Quantum gravity, a yet-unformulated theory, is crucial to understanding this regime.

One proposed approach involves considering the Hawking radiation emitted by black holes. This radiation, stemming from quantum fluctuations near the event horizon, suggests a gradual loss of mass and ultimately, black hole evaporation.  The information paradox, however, presents a significant challenge:  the seemingly irreversible nature of black hole formation contradicts unitary evolution predicted by quantum mechanics.  Resolving this requires a reconciliation between general relativity's description of spacetime curvature and the quantum mechanical principle of information preservation.  String theory, loop quantum gravity, and other candidate quantum gravity theories attempt to address this, proposing modifications to spacetime at the Planck scale that could prevent singularity formation or alter the nature of the event horizon itself.  Ultimately, a complete quantum description of black hole formation remains a central unsolved problem in theoretical physics.
