Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei, remains a crucial energy source and a subject of ongoing scientific investigation. This presentation will provide a concise overview of the fundamental principles governing fission, emphasizing the interplay between nuclear structure, neutron interactions, and energy release.  We will explore the various fissionable isotopes, including uranium-235 and plutonium-239, and discuss their differing fission characteristics.

Recent developments in the field will be a central focus.  We will examine advancements in reactor design, particularly those aimed at enhancing safety and efficiency, such as the development of Generation IV reactors employing innovative fuel cycles and passive safety features.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the growing interest in Accelerator Driven Subcritical Systems (ADS) for transmutation of nuclear waste and enhanced fuel utilization.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the ongoing research into fundamental nuclear data, crucial for improving the accuracy of reactor simulations and optimizing fuel management strategies. This improved understanding facilitates safer and more sustainable nuclear energy production, ultimately contributing to mitigating the impacts of climate change.
