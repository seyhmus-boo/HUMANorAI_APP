Chemical bonding and molecular structure remain central to understanding chemical reactivity and material properties.  This presentation will offer a concise overview of foundational concepts, emphasizing recent advancements in our ability to characterize and predict molecular behavior.  We will examine the continued refinement of density functional theory (DFT) and its applications in predicting complex bonding scenarios, including exotic bonding motifs in main-group and transition metal compounds.  Furthermore, the presentation will highlight breakthroughs in experimental techniques, such as advanced X-ray crystallography and electron microscopy, which enable increasingly precise determination of molecular structures, even for dynamic or transient species.  The interplay between theoretical predictions and experimental verification will be discussed, emphasizing the convergence of computational chemistry and experimental techniques in elucidating intricate bonding interactions.  Finally, the presentation will touch upon emerging areas, such as the application of machine learning to accelerate materials discovery based on predicted bonding and structural characteristics, opening exciting avenues for future research in this fundamental field.
