Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for diverse applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT chirality and diameter during synthesis remains elusive, leading to heterogeneous samples with varying properties.  Characterizing the structure and properties of individual CNTs within complex mixtures presents another hurdle.  Techniques like Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offer partial solutions, but accurate quantification of structural defects and precise determination of chirality remain challenging, particularly for high-density samples.  Furthermore, efficient and scalable purification methods to remove metallic CNTs or amorphous carbon are crucial but often compromise CNT integrity.  The inherent tendency of CNTs to agglomerate limits their processability and hinders the accurate measurement of intrinsic properties.  Overcoming these experimental limitations, including the development of advanced characterization tools and tailored synthesis strategies, is essential for unlocking the full potential of CNTs in advanced materials and devices.
