Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the process.  This energy release stems from the conversion of a small amount of mass into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  The fission process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the unstable nucleus to undergo asymmetric fission, yielding fission fragments, neutrons, and substantial kinetic energy.  These newly released neutrons can then trigger further fission events in a chain reaction, leading to a sustained release of energy, as seen in nuclear reactors.

The practical applications of nuclear fission are primarily focused on energy production.  Nuclear power plants harness the controlled chain reaction to generate heat, which is then used to produce steam and drive turbines for electricity generation.  Furthermore, nuclear fission has played a significant role in the development of nuclear weapons, where uncontrolled chain reactions lead to the devastating release of energy.  Beyond energy production, radioisotopes produced as byproducts of fission find application in various fields, including medicine (radiotherapy and diagnostics) and industrial processes (e.g., gauging and sterilization).
