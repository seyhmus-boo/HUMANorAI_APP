Black hole formation, while classically described by gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, necessitates a quantum mechanical interpretation at its core.  The singularity at the black hole's center represents a breakdown of classical general relativity, demanding a theory of quantum gravity for a complete understanding.  

Prior to the formation of an event horizon, the collapsing star's quantum state encompasses a vast superposition of possible configurations.  As gravitational forces dominate, the wave function collapses, although the precise mechanism remains elusive.  The information paradox arises from the apparent loss of quantum information during this process, contradicting unitary evolution.  Hypothesized resolutions involve Hawking radiation, suggesting that information is encoded in the outgoing Hawking quanta.  However, the detailed mechanism for this information retrieval remains a significant challenge.  Understanding the quantum nature of spacetime near the singularity and its implications for information preservation is crucial to fully elucidate black hole formation and evolution.  Ultimately, a unified theory of quantum gravity is necessary to resolve these outstanding issues.
