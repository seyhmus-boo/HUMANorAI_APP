Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems regardless of the spatial separation.  Imagine two coins flipped simultaneously, but linked such that one always lands heads while the other always tails â€“ this is analogous, albeit imperfectly, to entanglement.  However, unlike classical correlations, entangled particles exhibit a non-local correlation that transcends classical notions of causality.  Measurements performed on one entangled particle instantaneously influence the state of the others, even across vast distances. This instantaneous correlation isn't used for faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of individual measurements remains random.  Rather, the correlation manifests only upon comparison of multiple measurements.  Entanglement's counterintuitive nature arises from the superposition principle, where quantum systems exist in a probabilistic mix of states until measured.  This interconnectedness forms the bedrock for numerous applications, including quantum computing and cryptography, where the exploitation of entanglement offers unprecedented computational power and secure communication protocols fundamentally different from classical approaches.  Further research continues to explore the fundamental implications and practical applications of this peculiar quantum phenomenon.
