Carbon nanotubes, allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties with significant interdisciplinary implications.  Their cylindrical structure, comprised of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, leads to extraordinary mechanical strength, exceeding that of steel at a fraction of the weight. This high tensile strength finds applications in materials science, enabling the development of stronger and lighter composites for aerospace and automotive industries.  

Furthermore, their unique electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, are pivotal in electronics and nanotechnology.  This tunability allows for applications in high-frequency transistors and novel sensors.  Their high surface area facilitates their use in energy storage, notably in lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors, bridging materials science and electrochemical engineering.  Biomedical engineering also benefits, utilizing their biocompatibility for drug delivery systems and biosensors, highlighting the versatility and interdisciplinary impact of these remarkable nanomaterials.  Finally, their thermal conductivity, exceeding that of many metals, is exploited in thermal management applications.
