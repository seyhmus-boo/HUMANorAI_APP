DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating a DNA molecule, is crucial for cell division and heredity.  Initiation involves the unwinding of the double helix at specific origins of replication by helicases, aided by single-strand binding proteins to prevent reannealing.  Topoisomerases alleviate torsional stress ahead of the replication fork.  Leading-strand synthesis proceeds continuously by DNA polymerase III, utilizing an RNA primer synthesized by primase.  Lagging-strand synthesis is discontinuous, generating Okazaki fragments, each requiring a separate RNA primer.  DNA polymerase I removes these primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase subsequently joins the fragments, creating a continuous lagging strand.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity inherent to DNA polymerases, correcting errors during synthesis.  The overall process ensures the accurate transmission of genetic information from parent to daughter cells, a fundamental principle of molecular biology.  Further research continues to elucidate the intricate regulation and potential points of failure in this vital cellular process.
