Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, stems from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  The theoretical groundwork was laid by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the late 18th century, who conceptually described "dark stars" whose gravity was so strong that light couldn't escape.  However, it wasn't until Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in 1915 that a rigorous framework for understanding black holes emerged.  

The process begins with a star many times more massive than our Sun.  During its lifetime, nuclear fusion combats gravity's inward pull.  When the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, this outward pressure ceases.  For sufficiently massive stars, this triggers an unstoppable gravitational collapse.  The core implodes, exceeding the Schwarzschild radius â€“ the point of no return beyond which even light cannot escape.  This marks the formation of a singularity, a point of infinite density, surrounded by an event horizon, the boundary of the black hole.  The remaining stellar material may form an accretion disk, spiralling inwards and heating to extreme temperatures, emitting intense radiation observable by telescopes.  The precise details of the collapse and subsequent black hole characteristics depend on the initial stellar mass and composition.
