CRISPR-Cas systems, derived from bacterial adaptive immunity, have revolutionized genetic engineering.  Their efficacy stems from the programmable nature of the Cas enzyme, typically Cas9, which, guided by a complementary RNA molecule (guide RNA), induces a targeted double-strand break in DNA. This break is then repaired via cellular mechanisms, either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), leading to insertions or deletions (indels) and gene disruption, or homology-directed repair (HDR), enabling precise gene editing with a provided DNA template.

Recent developments significantly expand CRISPR's capabilities.  Base editors, fusing Cas enzymes with deaminases, allow for precise base conversions without double-strand breaks, minimizing off-target effects. Prime editing, employing a reverse transcriptase fused to Cas9, facilitates all 12 possible base-to-base conversions and small insertions or deletions with a single guide RNA.  Furthermore, advancements in delivery systems, including adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) and lipid nanoparticles, improve gene editing efficiency *in vivo*.  Ongoing research focuses on improving specificity, addressing off-target effects, and exploring novel Cas enzymes with expanded targeting capabilities for broader therapeutic and research applications.
