Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon of quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, irrespective of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, exhibiting strong non-local correlations that violate Bell inequalities.  Upon measurement of one entangled particle's state, the state of the other entangled particle is instantaneously determined, regardless of the distance separating them. This seemingly instantaneous correlation does not allow for faster-than-light communication, a critical point often misunderstood.  The entangled particles are described by a single, composite quantum state, and only upon measurement does their individual state collapse into a defined eigenstate. This feature has significant implications for various quantum technologies, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  The degree of entanglement is quantified using entanglement measures such as entanglement entropy or concurrence.  Ongoing research focuses on expanding our understanding of entanglement in multi-partite systems and leveraging this resource for technological advancements, including the development of robust quantum networks and fault-tolerant quantum computers.
