Good morning. Today's lecture concerns CRISPR-Cas9, a revolutionary gene-editing technology transforming genetic engineering.  Prior to CRISPR, techniques like zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) existed, but they were laborious and expensive.  CRISPR, originating from bacterial adaptive immune systems, offers a significantly improved methodology.

Discovered in the early 2000s, researchers observed that bacteria utilized CRISPR sequences to target and destroy invading viral DNA.  This naturally occurring mechanism was adapted for gene editing by repurposing the Cas9 enzyme, a DNA-cutting protein guided by a short RNA sequence (guide RNA).  The guide RNA is designed to target a specific DNA sequence, enabling precise gene modification – including gene knockouts, insertions, and corrections.

CRISPR’s simplicity, precision, and relatively low cost have propelled its widespread adoption across diverse fields, from therapeutic applications targeting genetic diseases to agricultural improvements enhancing crop yields.  However, ethical considerations surrounding its use, especially in germline editing, remain a critical area of ongoing debate and stringent regulation.
