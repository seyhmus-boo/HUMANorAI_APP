Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding a multifaceted approach encompassing general relativity, nuclear physics, and computational astrophysics. This presentation explores the diverse pathways leading to black hole genesis, emphasizing the interplay between these fields.  We will examine stellar-mass black hole formation through core-collapse supernovae, highlighting the critical role of the progenitor star's mass and metallicity, determined through stellar evolution models informed by nuclear reaction rates.  The uncertainties associated with the equation of state of dense nuclear matter and the complex neutrino transport mechanisms during core collapse will be discussed, underscoring the limitations and future directions in modeling these events.  Furthermore, we will touch upon the formation of supermassive black holes, exploring competing theories such as direct collapse and the hierarchical merging of stellar-mass black holes,  highlighting the crucial link between galaxy formation and the growth of these behemoths. The presentation will conclude by emphasizing the necessity of interdisciplinary collaborations to advance our understanding of these enigmatic objects and their profound impact on the evolution of the cosmos, utilizing advanced computational techniques and multi-messenger astronomy observations.
