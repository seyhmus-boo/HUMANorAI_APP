Nuclear fission, the splitting of an atomic nucleus into smaller nuclei, is a process of profound technological and scientific significance, underpinning nuclear energy generation and the development of nuclear weapons. While classical physics provides a macroscopic description of the fission process, a complete understanding necessitates a quantum mechanical framework. This research delves into the intricacies of nuclear fission through the lens of quantum mechanics, focusing on the pivotal role of quantum tunneling and nuclear shell structure.  The inherently probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is crucial in explaining the observed fission fragment distributions, which defy a purely classical deterministic interpretation. We will examine the quantum tunneling effect, which allows the nucleus to overcome the Coulomb barrier despite lacking sufficient classical kinetic energy, a phenomenon vital to initiating fission. Furthermore, the investigation will explore the influence of nuclear shell structure, highlighting how the arrangement of nucleons within the nucleus impacts the probability of fission and the characteristics of the resulting fragments.  Understanding these quantum phenomena is not merely an academic exercise; it underpins the development of more accurate fission models, crucial for improving the safety and efficiency of nuclear reactors and enhancing the predictive capabilities of nuclear stockpile stewardship.
