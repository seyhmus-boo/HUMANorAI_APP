Nuclear fission, the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, releases a substantial quantity of energy.  This energy release stems primarily from the mass defect, the difference in mass between the original nucleus and its fission products, which is converted into kinetic energy of the fragments and emitted neutrons.  The process is typically initiated by the absorption of a neutron, leading to the formation of an unstable compound nucleus.  This highly energized intermediate subsequently undergoes fission, yielding a diverse range of fission products, whose isotopic distribution is governed by probabilistic factors.  The emitted neutrons, crucial for sustaining a chain reaction, possess a spectrum of energies, with a significant fraction possessing sufficient energy to induce further fission events.  Control of the fission process, paramount in nuclear reactors, is achieved through the manipulation of neutron flux using moderators and control rods.  The precise characteristics of the fission process, including the energy yield, the spectrum of fission products, and the neutron emission rate, are dependent on the fissile isotope involved, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, and the incident neutron energy.  Understanding these intricate details is crucial for both the safe and efficient operation of nuclear reactors and the development of advanced nuclear technologies.
