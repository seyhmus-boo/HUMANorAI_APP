Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a class of allotropes of carbon with exceptional physicochemical properties stemming from their unique one-dimensional structure.  These cylindrical molecules, composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices, exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNTs).  Their remarkable mechanical strength, exceeding that of steel at a significantly lower density, is attributed to the strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms.  CNTs also exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality and diameter,  offering potential for advanced electronics.  Furthermore, their high aspect ratio and large surface area contribute to superior thermal conductivity and adsorption properties, making them attractive for thermal management and energy storage applications.  However, challenges remain in scalable, cost-effective production and the controlled manipulation of CNT chirality for targeted applications.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these obstacles and harnessing the full potential of CNTs in diverse fields, including composites, electronics, sensors, and biomedical engineering.
