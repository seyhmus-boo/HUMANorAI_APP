Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique sp²-hybridized structure.  This lecture will explore their key characteristics.  Firstly, their extraordinary mechanical strength and stiffness, surpassing that of steel, arises from the strong covalent bonds within the graphitic lattice.  Secondly, CNTs demonstrate remarkable electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality—the angle of the hexagonal lattice wrapping.  This tunable conductivity is crucial for their application in electronics.  Thirdly, their high aspect ratio and large surface area contribute to exceptional thermal conductivity and adsorption capabilities.  Finally, their inherent biocompatibility, although dependent on surface functionalization, makes them promising candidates for biomedical applications.  However, challenges remain in scalable production and controlled functionalization to fully realize their potential across diverse fields, including composites, energy storage, and sensors.  This presentation will conclude with a discussion of ongoing research and future prospects.
