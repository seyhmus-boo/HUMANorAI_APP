This presentation provides an overview of key plasma physics phenomena relevant to contemporary research.  We will explore fundamental processes governing plasma behavior, focusing on collective effects arising from the long-range Coulomb interaction.  Particular emphasis will be placed on wave-particle interactions, highlighting the crucial role of Landau damping in energy transfer and plasma stability.  The presentation will further examine instabilities, including the well-known two-stream instability and its implications for plasma heating and confinement.  We will discuss the generation and propagation of different plasma waves, such as Langmuir waves and ion-acoustic waves,  and their relevance in various contexts including fusion energy research and space physics.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the application of these phenomena in technological advancements, such as plasma processing for materials science and advanced propulsion systems.  The presentation aims to provide a foundational understanding of plasma physics for a diverse audience, bridging the gap between fundamental principles and their practical applications.
