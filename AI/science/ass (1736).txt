Plasma physics encompasses a diverse range of phenomena arising from the collective behavior of ionized gases.  This lecture will survey key aspects of this field, focusing on fundamental processes underpinning macroscopic plasma properties.  We will begin by examining Debye shielding, a crucial concept explaining the screening of electric fields within plasmas, leading to the emergence of quasi-neutrality.  Subsequently, the lecture will explore collective oscillations, including Langmuir waves and ion acoustic waves, highlighting their role in energy transport and wave-particle interactions.  Further discussion will cover instabilities, such as the two-stream instability and the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, emphasizing their significance in driving turbulent behavior and anomalous transport.  Finally, the lecture will briefly touch upon applications of plasma physics, encompassing areas such as fusion energy research and space plasma physics, showcasing the broad impact of understanding these fundamental phenomena.  Specific examples from each topic will be presented to illustrate the discussed concepts.
