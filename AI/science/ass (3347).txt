Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally explained by quantum mechanics, specifically through the interactions of electrons within the molecular framework.  The valence bond (VB) theory describes bonding as the overlap of atomic orbitals, forming localized electron density between nuclei.  This overlap leads to a decrease in potential energy, stabilizing the system.  Hybridization, a key concept within VB theory, allows for the formation of equivalent hybrid orbitals, explaining geometries observed in molecules like methane.

Conversely, molecular orbital (MO) theory employs a linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) to generate delocalized molecular orbitals spanning the entire molecule.  This approach, often implemented using computational methods like Hartree-Fock or density functional theory (DFT), provides a more comprehensive description of bonding, especially in conjugated systems.  Bond order, determined from the number of electrons in bonding and antibonding MOs, correlates with bond strength and length.  Furthermore, MO theory elegantly explains phenomena like resonance and aromaticity through the distribution of electrons across multiple molecular orbitals. The choice between VB and MO theory depends on the specific system and the properties of interest, with MO theory offering a more complete, albeit often computationally demanding, description of electronic structure.
