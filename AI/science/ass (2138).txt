Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in stellar evolution, primarily driven by gravitational collapse.  This lecture explores the astrophysical mechanisms leading to this phenomenon.  Massive stars, exceeding approximately 8-20 solar masses, exhaust their nuclear fuel, ultimately failing to generate sufficient outward pressure to counter their immense self-gravity.  This instability initiates core collapse, a rapid implosion driven by electron degeneracy pressure failure.  For sufficiently massive cores, the collapse proceeds unchecked, overcoming any neutron degeneracy pressure, resulting in the formation of a singularity â€“ a black hole.  The resulting spacetime curvature is so extreme that not even light can escape its gravitational pull.  Alternative formation mechanisms include the collapse of supermassive stars or the direct collapse of gas clouds in dense galactic nuclei, potentially explaining the existence of supermassive black holes at galactic centers.  Further research focuses on refining the mass thresholds for black hole formation, and elucidating the role of rotation and magnetic fields in the collapse process.
