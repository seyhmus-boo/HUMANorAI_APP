Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, presents a profound departure from classical intuition. This presentation offers a concise overview of entanglement from a purely quantum mechanical perspective, focusing on its mathematical description and key implications.  We begin by defining entanglement within the framework of composite quantum systems, illustrating how the entangled state vector cannot be factored into individual state vectors for its constituent subsystems.  This non-separability leads to correlations between measurements performed on these subsystems that violate Bell's inequalities, definitively demonstrating the incompatibility with local realism.  We will then explore the crucial role of entanglement in quantum information science, highlighting its utility in quantum computing, specifically within quantum algorithms like quantum teleportation and superdense coding.  Further discussion will cover the challenges associated with generating, maintaining, and manipulating entangled states, including the impact of decoherence.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the ongoing research exploring the fundamental nature of entanglement and its potential connections to other areas of physics, such as cosmology and condensed matter systems.
