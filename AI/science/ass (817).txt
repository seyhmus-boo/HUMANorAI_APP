Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is a process releasing substantial energy.  This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the daughter nuclei is less than the parent nucleus's mass; this mass difference is converted into energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².  The process is typically initiated by neutron bombardment, which causes the unstable nucleus to undergo fission, releasing further neutrons.  These secondary neutrons can then initiate further fission events, leading to a chain reaction, the basis of nuclear reactors and weapons.  The specific fission products and energy yield are dependent on the fissile isotope –  Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239 being prominent examples.  Control of the chain reaction is crucial; uncontrolled reactions result in rapid energy release, while controlled reactions are harnessed for power generation.  The byproducts of fission, including various radioactive isotopes, pose significant challenges related to waste management and environmental safety.  Research continues to optimize fission processes and mitigate associated risks.
