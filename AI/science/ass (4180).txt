Recent advancements in understanding photosynthesis mechanisms have revealed a significant role for quantum mechanics.  This review summarizes key findings highlighting the departure from classical interpretations.  Specifically, the excitation energy transfer between pigment molecules within the light-harvesting complexes is not solely governed by FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), a classical model.  Evidence suggests quantum coherence, involving superposition and entanglement of excitonic states, plays a crucial role, optimizing energy transfer efficiency to the reaction center.  This quantum effect, characterized by long-lived coherence times at physiological temperatures, appears to enable efficient funneling of energy to the reaction center, even across significant distances, minimizing energy losses.  However, the precise mechanisms by which the environment influences quantum coherence and its functional role remain subjects of ongoing debate.  While the "quantum biology" aspect of photosynthesis is compelling,  further research is needed to fully quantify the extent of quantum contributions and their impact on the overall photosynthetic efficiency under various environmental conditions. This includes investigating the role of decoherence and the development of more sophisticated theoretical models incorporating both quantum and classical aspects of the process.
