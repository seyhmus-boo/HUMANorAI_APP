Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, with ongoing theoretical and observational investigations refining our understanding of this remarkable process. This presentation will review the primary pathways leading to black hole formation, focusing on stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit, a process intricately linked to stellar evolution and supernovae.  We will examine the current understanding of the core-collapse mechanism, emphasizing the role of progenitor star properties and the complexities of numerical simulations in predicting the resulting black hole parameters.  The formation of supermassive black holes, however, presents a greater challenge, with leading hypotheses including direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe and the growth of seed black holes through accretion and mergers.  This presentation will explore the observational evidence supporting these scenarios, including the detection of high-redshift quasars and the implications for galaxy formation and evolution.  Furthermore, we will discuss the ongoing limitations in our understanding and highlight promising avenues for future research, such as advanced numerical modeling techniques and multi-messenger astronomy.  The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge concerning black hole formation, emphasizing the interplay between theoretical models and observational data.
