Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, has underpinned life on Earth for billions of years. Early understanding, stemming from Jan Ingenhousz's 1779 experiments demonstrating the role of light and plants in oxygen production, laid the groundwork for later discoveries.  The overall process is broadly divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).

The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.  Light energy excites chlorophyll molecules, initiating an electron transport chain that generates ATP and NADPH.  Water molecules are split (photolysis), releasing oxygen as a byproduct. The light-independent reactions, taking place in the stroma, utilize the ATP and NADPH generated to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic molecules like glucose, via a series of enzyme-catalysed reactions.  Different photosynthetic pathways, such as C4 and CAM photosynthesis, have evolved in response to environmental conditions, optimizing CO2 uptake and water conservation.  Continuous research further elucidates the intricate molecular mechanisms and regulatory pathways governing this essential biological process.
