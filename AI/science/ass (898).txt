Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, necessitates an interdisciplinary approach integrating concepts from general relativity, nuclear physics, and stellar astrophysics.  The process predominantly begins with the life cycle of massive stars (≥8 solar masses).  As these stars exhaust their nuclear fuel, their cores collapse under their own immense gravity, exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit. This collapse triggers a supernova explosion, a dramatic event studied through observational astronomy, leveraging techniques from spectroscopy and photometry to analyze the ejected material and remnant characteristics. The fate of the core depends on its mass; if it surpasses the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, even neutron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to counter gravitational collapse, leading to the formation of a singularity – a black hole.  Numerical relativity, employing sophisticated computational methods, models this dynamic process, bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and observational data.  Furthermore, the study of gravitational waves, detected through laser interferometry (an engineering feat), provides crucial observational evidence supporting the existence and formation mechanisms of black holes, further solidifying the interdisciplinary nature of this research field.
