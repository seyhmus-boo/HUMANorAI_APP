This presentation provides a concise overview of chemical bonding and its crucial role in determining molecular structure and properties.  We begin by exploring the fundamental principles governing the formation of chemical bonds, including ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding, highlighting the differences in electron distribution and resulting bond characteristics.  Emphasis will be placed on the valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory and its application in predicting molecular geometries.  The presentation will then delve into the influence of hybridization, resonance, and molecular orbital theory on bond order, bond length, and bond strength.  Specific examples will be used to illustrate how these concepts interplay to determine the three-dimensional structure of molecules.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the relationship between molecular structure and macroscopic properties such as melting point, boiling point, and reactivity.  Attendees will gain a comprehensive understanding of how chemical bonding dictates the behaviour and properties of molecules, forming a crucial foundation for advanced studies in chemistry, materials science, and related fields.
