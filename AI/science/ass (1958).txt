Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the interplay of the strong nuclear force, binding nucleons together, and the Coulomb repulsion between protons.  Quantum tunneling plays a crucial role; the potential energy barrier preventing spontaneous fission isn't insurmountable classically, but the wave function of the nucleus has a non-zero probability of penetrating this barrier, leading to fission.  This probability is significantly influenced by the shape of the nuclear potential, which is itself a complex many-body problem requiring sophisticated quantum mechanical models, often involving mean-field approximations like the Hartree-Fock method or density functional theory.  The collective nuclear motion leading to fission can be described using quantum collective coordinates, representing deformations of the nucleus.  The initial state of the nucleus is a superposition of many quantum states, and the fission process involves transitions between these states, often facilitated by the absorption of a neutron, which alters the nuclear potential and enhances tunneling probability.  The final fission products are also distributed according to quantum mechanical probability distributions, reflecting the statistical nature of the many-body interactions involved.  Understanding these quantum mechanical aspects is crucial for predicting fission yields and controlling the process in nuclear reactors and weapons.
