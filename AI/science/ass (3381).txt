Nuclear fission, the splitting of atomic nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery with profound implications for energy production and global affairs.  This presentation provides a concise overview of fission processes, tracing their historical trajectory from the theoretical predictions of Meitner, Frisch, and Hahn's experimental confirmation in 1938.  We will examine the fundamental physics underlying induced fission, focusing on the role of neutron interactions and the energy release associated with mass defect.  Different fissionable isotopes, particularly Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, will be discussed, highlighting their respective fission yields and neutron emission characteristics.  The presentation will then briefly explore the practical applications of fission, primarily in nuclear power generation, outlining the principles of reactor design and the associated challenges related to nuclear waste management and reactor safety.  Finally, we will touch upon the broader societal implications of fission technology, considering both its potential as a low-carbon energy source and the ongoing ethical and security concerns surrounding nuclear proliferation.  The aim is to offer a balanced perspective on this transformative scientific achievement and its enduring legacy.
