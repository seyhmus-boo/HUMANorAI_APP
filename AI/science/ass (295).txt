Black hole formation is a consequence of extreme gravitational collapse.  Stars exceeding a certain critical mass (approximately three times the mass of our Sun) exhaust their nuclear fuel, unable to sustain the outward pressure against inward gravitational forces.  This leads to a catastrophic implosion.  For sufficiently massive stars, the collapse is unremitting, overcoming even neutron degeneracy pressure, resulting in a singularity – a point of infinite density – at the center.  This singularity is surrounded by an event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

The formation process is complex, influenced by factors such as stellar rotation and magnetic fields.  Variations lead to different black hole types: stellar-mass black holes resulting from single star collapse, and supermassive black holes, whose formation mechanisms remain debated but potentially involve mergers of smaller black holes or direct collapse of massive gas clouds.

Practically, studying black hole formation enhances our understanding of stellar evolution and galactic dynamics.  Observational data from gravitational wave detectors like LIGO provide insights into binary black hole mergers, testing theories of gravity and informing cosmological models.  Furthermore, understanding the accretion processes around black holes informs research into high-energy astrophysical phenomena like quasars and active galactic nuclei.
