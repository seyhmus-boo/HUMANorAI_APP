Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure.  This review summarizes key characteristics relevant to diverse applications.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile moduli exceeding those of steel, coupled with significant flexibility and high aspect ratios, renders them ideal for reinforcement in composite materials.  Excellent electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, positions CNTs as promising candidates for nanoelectronics and sensors.  Furthermore, their high surface area facilitates exceptional adsorption capabilities, exploited in gas storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain, notably the efficient dispersion and functionalization of CNTs for optimal integration into macroscopic systems.  The inherent toxicity of some CNT types necessitates further investigation into biocompatibility.  Despite these limitations, the exceptional combination of mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties makes CNTs a focal point of ongoing research, with potential applications spanning materials science, electronics, and energy storage.  Future research should focus on scalable production methods and improved control over CNT structure and properties.
