Catalysts in organic chemistry are substances that accelerate reaction rates without being consumed themselves.  Their action centers on lowering the activation energy of a reaction, achieved by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower energy transition state. This occurs through the formation of intermediate complexes between the catalyst and reactants, facilitating bond breaking and formation.  Catalysts can be homogeneous, dissolving in the reaction medium, or heterogeneous, remaining in a separate phase.

Homogeneous catalysts often involve transition metal complexes which can alter the electronic environment of reactants, promoting specific transformations like oxidation or reduction.  Heterogeneous catalysts, frequently solid metals or metal oxides, offer advantages in ease of separation from products.  Their active sites provide specific geometries conducive to adsorption and reaction of reactants.

Practical applications are ubiquitous.  Zeolites, heterogeneous catalysts, are crucial in petroleum refining and cracking.  Wilkinson's catalyst, a homogeneous rhodium complex, is widely used for hydrogenation reactions in pharmaceutical synthesis.  Palladium catalysts facilitate numerous cross-coupling reactions vital for creating complex organic molecules, including pharmaceuticals and materials.  Enzyme catalysts, biological macromolecules, drive countless reactions within living organisms, highlighting the crucial role of catalysis in both natural and synthetic organic chemistry.
