Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes.  Imagine an atom's nucleus as a meticulously balanced stack of building blocks, representing neutrons and protons.  These blocks, however, are held together by a delicate, internal force, akin to a carefully constructed Jenga tower.  In fission, we introduce a destabilizing element – a neutron,  like a forceful tap on the Jenga tower.  This neutron's impact causes the nucleus to become unstable and break apart, splitting into two smaller nuclei, our 'smaller Jenga towers'.  This splitting releases a significant amount of energy, comparable to the sudden collapse of a precariously balanced structure, manifested as kinetic energy of the fragments and released neutrons.  These released neutrons, in turn, can trigger further fissions in nearby nuclei, creating a chain reaction – a domino effect rapidly toppling our Jenga towers. Controlling this chain reaction is crucial in nuclear power generation, whereas uncontrolled fission leads to the explosive power of nuclear weapons.  Therefore, understanding the delicate balance within the atomic nucleus is paramount to harnessing or controlling this potent energy source.
