Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics and experimentally verified, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  Initially conceived within the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox in 1935, which aimed to demonstrate the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, entanglement highlighted the inherent limitations of classical intuition. EPR posited that correlated systems must possess pre-existing properties, rejecting the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum superposition.

However, subsequent theoretical work, notably Bell's theorem (1964), provided a framework to experimentally test the predictions of quantum mechanics against those of local realism.  Numerous experiments, culminating in sophisticated loophole-free tests, have consistently confirmed violations of Bell inequalities, demonstrating the reality of entangled states and their incompatibility with classical physics.

Entanglement manifests as a strong correlation between the measurement outcomes of entangled particles, regardless of the spatial separation.  Measuring the state of one instantaneously influences the state of the other, leading to seemingly faster-than-light correlations, though without enabling faster-than-light communication. This counterintuitive behavior has profound implications for quantum computing and quantum cryptography, promising advancements in secure communication and computational power through techniques like quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution.
