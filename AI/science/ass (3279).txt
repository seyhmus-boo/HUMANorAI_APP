Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, presents significant experimental challenges despite its theoretical understandability.  Precise control over the fission process is paramount, demanding sophisticated techniques to achieve criticality and maintain a sustained chain reaction.  This requires careful manipulation of neutron flux, necessitating highly sensitive detectors and advanced feedback mechanisms to prevent uncontrolled reactions, a key safety concern.  Moreover, accurate measurement of fission fragment yields and energy distributions presents difficulties due to the high energy and varied nature of the products.  This requires highly specialized detectors capable of resolving the complex spectra of emitted particles and radiation.  Further complexities arise in studying the short-lived isotopes produced, demanding rapid analysis techniques to capture transient phenomena before decay.  Finally, the inherently hazardous nature of radioactive materials necessitates robust safety protocols and shielding, adding considerable complexity to experimental setups and data acquisition. These combined challenges highlight the demanding nature of fission research.
