This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, tracing their historical development and outlining their fundamental principles.  We will begin by examining the pivotal discoveries leading to the understanding of nuclear fission, highlighting the contributions of scientists such as Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, whose experimental work, interpreted by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, revealed the process of uranium nucleus splitting. The presentation will then delve into the underlying physics of fission, focusing on the role of neutron bombardment, critical mass, and the release of enormous amounts of energy as a consequence of mass-energy equivalence.  Different fissionable isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, and their respective characteristics will be compared.  Finally, the presentation will briefly address the diverse applications of nuclear fission, from electricity generation in nuclear power plants to the historical context of nuclear weaponry. The discussion will conclude with a brief consideration of the challenges and ongoing debates surrounding nuclear fission's role in meeting global energy demands while mitigating its inherent risks.
