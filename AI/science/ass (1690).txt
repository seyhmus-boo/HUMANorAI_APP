Photosynthesis, the process underpinning most life on Earth, has captivated scientists for centuries.  Early observations, dating back to the 17th century with van Helmont’s willow tree experiment, hinted at the role of water and soil in plant growth, albeit without a complete understanding of the underlying mechanisms.  The pivotal discovery of oxygen evolution during photosynthesis by Ingenhousz in the late 18th century significantly advanced the field.  The 20th century witnessed groundbreaking progress with the elucidation of the two main photosynthetic pathways: C3 and C4.  Ruben and Kamen’s isotopic tracing experiments in the 1940s solidified the role of water as the electron donor, while Hill’s demonstration of isolated chloroplast activity provided crucial insight into the light-dependent reactions.

This presentation will provide a concise overview of modern understanding of photosynthetic mechanisms, focusing on the light-dependent and light-independent (Calvin cycle) reactions.  We will discuss the roles of photosystems I and II, the electron transport chain, ATP synthase, and carbon fixation enzymes, highlighting key structural features and regulatory processes.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly touch upon the evolutionary adaptations observed in C4 and CAM plants, emphasizing their enhanced efficiency in arid and high-light environments. Finally, we will briefly explore the ongoing research into harnessing photosynthetic principles for bioenergy applications.
