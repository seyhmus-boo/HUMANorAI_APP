Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a class of allotropes exhibiting exceptional properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms.  Their discovery revolutionized materials science, sparking intense research into their potential applications.  Key properties include exceptional mechanical strength, exceeding that of steel at a fraction of the weight, alongside high Young's modulus indicating remarkable stiffness.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable electrical conductivity, demonstrating either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality (the angle of the hexagonal lattice). This tunability opens doors for applications in electronics.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, making them suitable for thermal management systems.  Finally, CNTs exhibit significant surface area, leading to applications in catalysis and gas storage.  However, challenges remain, notably in achieving consistent large-scale production and controlling their chirality to optimize specific properties. Despite these obstacles, the remarkable properties of CNTs continue to fuel research efforts aiming to unlock their full potential across various technological sectors.
