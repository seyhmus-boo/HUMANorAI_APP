Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit a remarkable array of properties driving interdisciplinary research.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from the spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds, surpasses that of steel, making them highly attractive in materials science and engineering for applications like reinforced composites.  Simultaneously, their unique electronic structure, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, renders them crucial in electronics and nanoscale device fabrication.

This duality extends into chemistry, where CNTs' high surface area facilitates catalysis and adsorption, leading to applications in sensing and environmental remediation.  Furthermore, their biocompatibility, depending on functionalization, opens doors to biomedical engineering,  allowing for drug delivery and tissue scaffolding.  The exceptional thermal conductivity of CNTs is exploited in thermal management systems.  Therefore, understanding CNT properties necessitates a multidisciplinary approach, integrating knowledge from physics, chemistry, materials science, and engineering to fully realize their vast potential.
