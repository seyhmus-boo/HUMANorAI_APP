Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, resulting in entangled particles exhibiting correlated behavior even when spatially separated.  This presentation will explore the foundational concepts of entanglement, including the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox and Bell's theorem, which experimentally demonstrated the violation of Bell inequalities and confirmed the reality of entanglement.  We will discuss various methods for generating entangled states, including spontaneous parametric down-conversion and trapped ion techniques.  Furthermore, we will review recent advancements in the utilization of entangled states for applications in quantum information science, focusing on quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  Specific examples will be presented to illustrate the power and potential of entanglement in enabling novel technologies beyond the capabilities of classical systems.  The presentation will conclude with a discussion of current challenges and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.
