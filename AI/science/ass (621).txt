Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, is a fundamental process underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry.  This lecture explored the underlying mechanisms driving fission, focusing on the role of neutron bombardment in initiating chain reactions.  We examined the critical mass concept, highlighting the necessity for a sufficient quantity of fissile material to sustain a self-sustaining reaction.  Different fissionable isotopes, notably Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, were compared with respect to their fission cross-sections and energy yields. The lecture further discussed the energetic consequences of fission, including the release of significant amounts of kinetic energy and the emission of additional neutrons, which are crucial for chain reaction propagation.  Finally, we touched upon the associated challenges of nuclear waste management and the potential for uncontrolled chain reactions, emphasizing the critical need for robust safety protocols in nuclear applications.  Further research is needed to optimize energy extraction and minimize the long-term risks associated with fission products.
