DNA replication is a semiconservative process crucial for cellular proliferation and inheritance.  It involves the unwinding of the parental double helix by enzymes like helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins prevent reannealing, while topoisomerases alleviate torsional stress.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate synthesis of the leading and lagging strands.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase joins Okazaki fragments, creating a continuous lagging strand.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity of DNA polymerases.

Understanding DNA replication has myriad practical applications.  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology, which amplifies specific DNA sequences, directly leverages the principles of DNA replication for diagnostic testing, forensic science, and molecular biology research.  Furthermore, the study of replication mechanisms underpins the development of novel cancer therapies targeting replication machinery, and allows for advancements in genetic engineering and gene therapy.  Manipulating replication fidelity holds promise for targeted mutagenesis in research and biotechnology.
