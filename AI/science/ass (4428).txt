Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  Unlike classical mechanics, which cannot explain the stability of nuclei against electrostatic repulsion, the quantum mechanical model incorporates the strong nuclear force, a short-range attractive force mediated by gluons, counteracting the Coulombic repulsion between protons.  

Fission occurs when the quantum tunneling probability of a nucleus exceeding a critical deformation surpasses a threshold. This deformation, often induced by neutron absorption, leads to a redistribution of the nuclear potential energy landscape.  The wavefunction of the nucleus then becomes significantly delocalized, facilitating the tunneling process through the potential barrier separating the initial state from the separated, more stable, fission fragments.  The released energy, primarily from the decrease in the strong nuclear forceâ€™s influence and the associated mass defect, manifests as kinetic energy of the fragments and emitted neutrons, crucial for sustaining chain reactions in nuclear reactors. The precise probabilities and energy distributions of the fragments are determined by the complex interplay of quantum tunneling and the underlying nuclear forces, making accurate prediction a computationally intensive task.
