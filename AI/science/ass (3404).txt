Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have spurred significant interest in their application across diverse fields.  Their extraordinary tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, combined with remarkable flexibility, makes them ideal candidates for reinforcing composites in aerospace and automotive industries.  Depending on their chirality, CNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials, offering potential for advanced electronic devices such as field-effect transistors and transparent conductors.  The high thermal conductivity of CNTs facilitates their use in thermal management applications, including heat dissipation in electronics and enhanced heat transfer fluids.  Furthermore, their large surface area makes them attractive for energy storage (e.g., supercapacitors, batteries) and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in scalable, cost-effective production,  consistent quality control, and effective dispersion for widespread integration into practical applications.  Ongoing research focuses on addressing these challenges to fully realize the transformative potential of CNTs across various technological sectors.
