Catalysts are indispensable in organic chemistry, accelerating reaction rates without being consumed themselves.  They achieve this by lowering the activation energy via the formation of intermediate complexes, thereby providing alternative, lower-energy reaction pathways.  Traditionally, homogeneous catalysts, dissolved in the reaction mixture, dominated, offering high selectivity but suffering from separation difficulties.  Heterogeneous catalysts, bound to a solid support, addressed this limitation, albeit often exhibiting lower activity.

Recent developments focus on bridging the gap between these approaches.  Supported homogeneous catalysts, where a homogeneous catalyst is immobilized on a solid support, are gaining traction, combining the advantages of both systems.  Furthermore, significant progress has been made in the design of highly selective and active heterogeneous catalysts through advancements in nanotechnology and materials science, utilizing metal nanoparticles, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and porous organic polymers (POPs).  Computational chemistry plays an increasingly crucial role in catalyst design, enabling predictive modelling and optimization of catalyst structures for enhanced efficiency and selectivity in specific organic transformations.  This interplay between experimental synthesis and computational modelling promises further breakthroughs in sustainable and efficient organic catalysis.
