This review examines chemical bonding and molecular structure through the lens of quantum mechanics, moving beyond simplistic valence bond and molecular orbital theories.  A rigorous quantum mechanical treatment reveals the limitations of these models, particularly in accurately predicting bond energies and geometries for complex systems.  Density functional theory (DFT), a powerful computational approach, emerges as a crucial tool for understanding bonding in molecules beyond the scope of analytical solutions.  DFT's success lies in its ability to approximate the many-electron problem, providing accurate descriptions of electron density distribution, which directly correlates with molecular properties.  However, challenges remain, particularly in accurately describing systems with strong correlation effects and dynamic charge transfer.  Post-Hartree-Fock methods, while computationally demanding, offer improved accuracy for these challenging cases.  Overall, a quantum mechanical perspective underscores the fundamental role of electron interactions in determining molecular structure and properties, highlighting the sophisticated computational tools necessary for accurate prediction and interpretation.  Further advancements in theoretical methodology are crucial for expanding our understanding of complex chemical systems.
