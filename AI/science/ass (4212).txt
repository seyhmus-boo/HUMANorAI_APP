Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, transcends disciplinary boundaries, drawing upon general relativity, nuclear physics, and computational astrophysics.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (≥20 solar masses) at the end of their lifecycle.  This process, governed by general relativity, is significantly influenced by stellar evolution models predicated on nuclear reactions within the star's core.  The complex interplay of pressure gradients, nuclear burning stages, and the subsequent ejection of outer layers determines the final mass and spin of the nascent black hole.

Beyond stellar-mass black holes, supermassive black holes (SMBHs), residing at galactic centers, pose a more enigmatic origin.  While direct collapse of massive gas clouds is proposed, this process requires nuanced understanding of gas dynamics, radiative transfer, and magnetic fields – areas demanding sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations.  Furthermore, the merger of smaller black holes, predicted by general relativity and observed gravitationally, plays a crucial role in SMBH growth.  Interdisciplinary studies, integrating observational data from multi-wavelength astronomy with theoretical models and high-performance computing, are essential to fully understand the formation and evolution of black holes across the cosmic scales.
