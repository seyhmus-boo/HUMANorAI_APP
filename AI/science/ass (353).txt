Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, relies on two principal mechanisms: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.  Light-dependent reactions, occurring in thylakoid membranes, involve photosystems I and II, generating ATP and NADPH via electron transport and photolysis of water.  Recent advancements focus on elucidating the intricate details of these processes, including the precise mechanisms of energy transfer within photosystems and the role of accessory pigments beyond chlorophyll a.

The Calvin cycle, in the stroma, fixes atmospheric CO2 into organic molecules.  Significant research centers on understanding the regulation of Rubisco, the key carboxylase enzyme, which is often limited by substrate availability and prone to oxygenation (photorespiration).  Recent work explores engineering Rubisco for improved efficiency, investigating alternative carbon fixation pathways (e.g., C4 and CAM photosynthesis) and manipulating the expression of key enzymes.  Furthermore, significant strides have been made in understanding the interconnectedness between these two phases, highlighting the dynamic regulation of photosynthetic electron transport and carbon fixation in response to environmental cues like light intensity and CO2 concentration.  These advancements are crucial for developing strategies to enhance crop yields and mitigate climate change.
