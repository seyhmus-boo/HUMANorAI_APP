Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, exhibiting strong correlations even when the entangled particles are spatially separated.  Einstein famously termed this "spooky action at a distance," highlighting its counter-intuitive nature.  Entanglement arises from the superposition principle, where a composite system exists in a superposition of entangled states, undefinable independently for its constituent parts until measurement.  Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously collapses the wave function, determining the state of the other, regardless of the spatial distance separating them.  This non-local correlation has profound implications, defying classical locality and realism.  Experimentally confirmed violations of Bell's inequalities firmly establish the reality of entanglement.  Current research focuses on harnessing entanglement for practical applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation, aiming to exploit its non-classical features for surpassing the limitations of classical information processing and communication.  Despite its experimental verification, the foundational interpretations of entanglement continue to be debated within the quantum foundations community.
