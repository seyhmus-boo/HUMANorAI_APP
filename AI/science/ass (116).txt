Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamental concepts underpinning the properties and reactivity of matter.  This lecture explores the primary types of chemical bonds – ionic, covalent, and metallic – highlighting the interplay between electronegativity differences and the resultant electron distribution. Ionic bonds, arising from electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, are characterized by high melting points and crystallinity.  Covalent bonds, formed by the sharing of electron pairs, lead to a diverse range of molecular structures determined by factors including valence electron count and hybridisation.  VSEPR theory provides a predictive framework for molecular geometry, while valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory offer deeper insights into bonding mechanisms.  Metallic bonding, characterized by delocalized electrons within a sea of positive ions, accounts for the unique properties of metals such as conductivity and malleability. Understanding these bonding models is crucial for predicting and interpreting macroscopic properties, such as solubility, reactivity, and physical state, based on a molecule's microscopic structure.  This lecture provides a foundational understanding of these interconnected concepts.
