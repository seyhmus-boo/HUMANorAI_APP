Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional properties, continue to be a subject of intense research.  Their unique combination of high tensile strength, superior electrical conductivity (depending on chirality), and remarkable thermal conductivity makes them attractive for diverse applications.  Recent developments have focused on enhancing control over CNT synthesis, particularly in achieving high purity and specific chirality distributions, crucial for optimizing desired properties.  Significant progress has been made in scalable production methods, addressing a key limitation for widespread adoption.

Furthermore, research into functionalization strategies – including covalent and non-covalent modifications – has expanded the range of CNT applications.  These techniques enable tailoring of CNT surface chemistry for enhanced compatibility with polymers, improved dispersion in solvents, and the creation of novel nanocomposites with specific functionalities.  Recent studies highlight the exploration of CNTs in advanced energy storage devices, such as high-performance batteries and supercapacitors, as well as their integration into next-generation electronics and biomedical sensors.  However, challenges remain, including the cost-effective separation of metallic and semiconducting nanotubes and the long-term stability of functionalized CNTs under operational conditions.  Ongoing research addresses these limitations, paving the way for broader implementation of CNTs in diverse technological fields.
