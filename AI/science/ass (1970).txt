Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  These cylindrical structures, composed entirely of sp² hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility, makes them ideal for composite materials applications, a field witnessing recent advancements in lightweight, high-strength aerospace components.

Electrically, CNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials, depending on their chirality – the arrangement of carbon atoms. This tunability is crucial for nanoelectronics, with recent research showcasing their potential in high-frequency transistors and flexible displays.  Furthermore, their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, making them valuable in thermal management systems.  Recent developments include improved synthesis techniques, yielding higher purity and more controlled diameter CNTs, thereby enhancing their overall performance and broadening their applicability in diverse fields.  Ongoing research is actively exploring their potential in biomedical applications, such as drug delivery and biosensors.
