Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a subject of significant experimental challenges despite theoretical predictions rooted in general relativity.  Direct observation of the process is inherently difficult due to the extreme spacetime curvature and gravitational lensing effects near the event horizon.  Current observational strategies primarily rely on detecting gravitational waves from mergers of stellar-mass black holes, offering indirect evidence of formation through core-collapse supernovae. However, the precise progenitor star characteristics and dynamics leading to black hole formation remain uncertain, with limitations in resolving pre-collapse stellar structures and neutrino emission. Electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events provide crucial complementary information but suffer from challenges in isolating emission related specifically to black hole formation amid complex supernova phenomena.  Further advancement hinges on improved gravitational wave detector sensitivity to probe fainter signals and a broader range of masses, combined with multi-messenger astronomy employing high-resolution electromagnetic observations across the spectrum, particularly in the neutrino and gamma-ray bands. These synergistic approaches promise a more complete understanding of this fundamental astrophysical process.
