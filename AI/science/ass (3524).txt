DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding emerged from Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty's 1944 demonstration of DNA as the hereditary material, paving the way for subsequent discoveries.  Watson and Crick's 1953 double helix model provided the crucial structural basis, proposing a semi-conservative mechanism where each strand serves as a template for a new complementary strand.  Meselson and Stahl's elegant experiment in 1958 definitively confirmed this semi-conservative replication.

The process involves a complex interplay of enzymes, including DNA helicases unwinding the double helix, single-strand binding proteins stabilizing the separated strands, DNA polymerases synthesizing new strands in a 5' to 3' direction, and DNA ligase joining Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.  Telomeres and telomerase address the challenge of replicating linear chromosome ends.  Prokaryotic and eukaryotic replication differ in the complexity of their machinery and regulation, reflecting the organizational differences in their genomes.  Errors in replication, while infrequent due to proofreading mechanisms, can lead to mutations contributing to genetic diversity and disease.  Ongoing research continues to elucidate the intricacies of this vital cellular process and its regulation.
