Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems irrespective of the spatial separation between them.  This interconnectedness surpasses classical intuition, where independent systems evolve individually.  Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) famously challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics in their 1935 paper, highlighting entanglement's seemingly paradoxical nature, suggesting the existence of "hidden variables" to explain the correlations.

However, Bell's theorem (1964) demonstrated that any local hidden-variable theory would produce predictions differing from those of quantum mechanics.  Subsequent experimental verification of Bell inequalities' violations decisively refuted local realism, bolstering the reality of entanglement.  Entanglement arises from the superposition principle, where a composite system can exist in a superposition of entangled states.  Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously collapses the wave function, determining the state of the others, regardless of distance, leading to instantaneous correlation, though no faster-than-light information transfer is possible. This counter-intuitive property holds significant implications for quantum computing and communication technologies.
