Chemical bonding and molecular structure represent a cornerstone of chemistry, explaining the macroscopic properties of substances based on their microscopic composition.  Early theories, such as Kekulé's structural formulas in the 19th century, provided rudimentary models of molecular connectivity, laying the groundwork for understanding isomerism.  However, these lacked the explanatory power to account for the stability and geometries of molecules.  The advent of quantum mechanics revolutionized the field.  The valence bond theory (VBT), drawing on the concept of orbital overlap, described covalent bonding as the sharing of electron pairs between atomic orbitals, successfully predicting molecular geometries through hybridization models like sp³, sp², and sp.  Simultaneously, molecular orbital (MO) theory offered a more sophisticated, delocalized picture of bonding, employing linear combinations of atomic orbitals to generate bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals, effectively explaining phenomena like resonance and aromaticity.  Both VBT and MO theory are crucial tools, with VBT providing a more intuitive, localized perspective, while MO theory affords a more accurate, albeit complex, description of electronic structure and bonding in molecules.  Further advancements continue to refine our understanding, incorporating computational methods to predict and analyze increasingly complex molecular systems.
