Quantum entanglement is a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation arises from the superposition principle and the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.  Unlike classical correlations, which can be explained by pre-existing local properties, entangled systems exhibit strong correlations even when spatially separated.  

Mathematically, this is represented by a composite quantum state that cannot be expressed as a product of individual states for each subsystem.  Instead, the entangled state exists as a superposition of multiple product states, implying an inextricable link between the constituent particles.  Measurement on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them, a phenomenon seemingly violating locality but not causality, as no information can be transmitted faster than light.  This non-local correlation is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, with implications for quantum information science and our understanding of reality itself.  The violation of Bell inequalities experimentally confirms the existence of entanglement and its non-classical nature.
