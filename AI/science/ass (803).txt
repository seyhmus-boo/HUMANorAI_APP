Black hole formation arises from the ultimate triumph of gravity over all other forces.  Imagine a massive star, a celestial body fueled by nuclear fusion, as a colossal balloon filled with pressurized gas.  This fusion, analogous to the balloon's internal pressure, counteracts the inward pull of gravity.  However, when the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, this internal pressure diminishes, akin to slowly releasing air from the balloon.

Gravity, previously held in check, now asserts its dominance.  The star's core collapses catastrophically, a process likened to the balloon abruptly imploding. If the stellar remnant's mass exceeds a critical threshold (approximately three times the mass of our Sun),  gravity's grip becomes so intense that even light, the universe's fastest entity, cannot escape its clutches. This point of no return defines the event horizon, the boundary of the black holeâ€”a region of spacetime with infinite density at its singularity,  analogous to the balloon's imploded point vanishing entirely. This process transforms a once luminous star into an invisible cosmic sinkhole, forever warping the fabric of spacetime around it.
