Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the mechanisms of photosynthesis, a process fundamental to life on Earth.  Early understanding, dating back to the 17th century with van Helmont's willow tree experiment, incorrectly attributed plant growth solely to water uptake.  However, subsequent research, notably Ingenhousz's demonstration of the light dependence of oxygen production, paved the way for a more comprehensive understanding.

Photosynthesis, broadly, involves two key stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent, or Calvin cycle, reactions.  In the light-dependent reactions, light energy excites chlorophyll molecules within photosystems II and I, driving electron transport chains that generate ATP and NADPH.  These energy-carrying molecules are crucial for the Calvin cycle.  This cycle, discovered by Melvin Calvin, utilizes ATP and NADPH to fix atmospheric CO2 into organic molecules, primarily glucose, through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  This process effectively converts light energy into chemical energy stored within the bonds of sugars, sustaining almost all ecosystems on our planet.  Further intricacies, such as the C4 and CAM pathways, represent adaptations to specific environmental conditions.
