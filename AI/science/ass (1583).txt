Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy and gamma radiation.  This process is initiated by neutron bombardment, causing the nucleus to become unstable and undergo fission.  The released neutrons can then trigger further fission events, creating a chain reaction â€“ the basis of nuclear reactors and weapons.

Recent developments focus on improving the efficiency and safety of fission processes.  Research into advanced reactor designs, such as molten salt reactors (MSRs) and fast breeder reactors (FBRs), aims to enhance fuel utilization and reduce waste production. MSRs offer improved safety features due to their inherent passive safety mechanisms and the ability to continuously process fuel. FBRs, by utilizing fast neutrons, can breed more fissile material than they consume, significantly extending the lifespan of nuclear fuel reserves.  Furthermore, advancements in nuclear fuel cycle management, including improved reprocessing techniques, aim to minimize the long-term radiological impact of spent nuclear fuel.  These developments represent a concerted effort to enhance the sustainability and safety of nuclear fission as a potential energy source.
