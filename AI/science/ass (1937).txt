Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have captivated researchers since their discovery in 1991 by Iijima.  This presentation will explore the remarkable properties of these nanomaterials, focusing on their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  Their extraordinary tensile strength, surpassing that of steel at a significantly lower density, makes them ideal candidates for reinforcement in composite materials.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit unique electrical properties, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality, offering potential for advanced electronics and sensors.  Their high thermal conductivity contributes to their efficacy in thermal management applications.

The presentation will delve into the structure-property relationships governing these characteristics, highlighting the influence of diameter, chirality, and defects on the overall behaviour. We will also briefly discuss the challenges associated with CNT production, purification, and functionalization, which are crucial for realizing their full potential in diverse technological fields. Finally, we will provide an overview of current and future applications of CNTs, encompassing areas such as energy storage, biomedical engineering, and advanced composites, emphasizing the ongoing research efforts towards harnessing their remarkable capabilities.
