Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with unique cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their spÂ²-hybridized carbon network.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to remarkable tensile strength and Young's modulus, far exceeding those of steel.  Excellent electrical conductivity, varying from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, is another key feature, alongside exceptional thermal conductivity. These properties are highly promising for applications in diverse fields, including electronics, composites, and energy storage.

However, experimental investigation of CNT properties presents significant challenges.  Precise control over chirality and diameter during synthesis remains elusive, leading to heterogeneous samples with varying properties.  Characterizing individual nanotubes' properties is hampered by difficulties in isolating and manipulating these microscopic structures.  Furthermore, the strong van der Waals forces between nanotubes lead to bundling, affecting measurable properties and necessitating complex purification and dispersion techniques.  Quantifying the precise contribution of structural defects to the overall properties remains an ongoing area of research, significantly impacting the reproducibility and reliability of experimental data.  Overcoming these challenges is crucial for realizing the full potential of CNTs in technological applications.
