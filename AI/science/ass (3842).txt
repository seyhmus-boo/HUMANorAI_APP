Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical locality, implying that the constituent particles exhibit correlated behaviour even when spatially separated to a degree that precludes classical communication.  The entangled state, described by a composite wavefunction that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each subsystem, dictates the outcomes of measurements performed on the individual particles.  Crucially, measuring the observable of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding observable of the other, regardless of the distance separating them.  This apparent instantaneous correlation does not, however, violate special relativity as no information can be transmitted faster than light.  Instead, the correlation arises from the inherent non-locality of the quantum wavefunction and the violation of Bell's inequalities, experimentally confirmed, showcasing the fundamentally probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics and its departure from classical realism.  Further exploration of entanglement is crucial for advancements in quantum computing and quantum cryptography, harnessing the power of this uniquely quantum phenomenon.
