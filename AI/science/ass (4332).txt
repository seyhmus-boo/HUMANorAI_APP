This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on the underlying physics and their diverse practical applications.  We will begin by examining the fundamental principles governing nuclear fission, including the role of neutron bombardment, critical mass, and the release of significant energy via the conversion of mass into energy as described by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.  Different fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, and their respective fission yields will be discussed, highlighting the variations in energy release and byproduct generation.

The presentation will then explore the controlled and uncontrolled release of fission energy.  Controlled fission, as employed in nuclear reactors, will be examined, outlining the mechanisms for sustaining chain reactions and managing reactor power output.  Various reactor designs and their associated safety features will be briefly touched upon.  In contrast, the uncontrolled release of energy, as seen in nuclear weapons, will be addressed, highlighting the catastrophic consequences of such events and the underlying principles of weapon design.

Finally, we will explore the significant practical applications of nuclear fission, encompassing electricity generation, medical isotopes (e.g., for cancer therapy), and industrial applications like sterilization and materials analysis.  The presentation will conclude with a brief discussion of the challenges and ongoing research related to nuclear waste management and reactor safety.
