Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition.  Its conceptual roots lie in the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox of 1935, a thought experiment highlighting apparent contradictions between quantum mechanics and locality.  EPR argued that quantum mechanics must be incomplete, as it seemed to allow for instantaneous correlations between spatially separated particles â€“ a violation of Einstein's cherished principle of locality.

However, subsequent experimental verification, notably Bell's theorem and experiments testing Bell inequalities, demonstrated that these correlations are indeed real.  Quantum entanglement involves two or more particles becoming linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the distance separating them.  Measuring a property of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the other, even across vast interstellar distances. This non-local correlation, while seemingly paradoxical, is a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics, with profound implications for quantum computing and cryptography.  Future research will continue to unravel the deeper mysteries and exploit the potential of this bizarre, yet powerful, phenomenon.
