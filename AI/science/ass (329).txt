This presentation offers a quantum mechanical perspective on nuclear fission processes, moving beyond the classical liquid drop model. We will explore the crucial role of quantum tunneling in initiating fission, emphasizing its dependence on the nuclear potential energy surface and the associated probability of barrier penetration. The presentation will delve into the quantum nature of collective nuclear motion, focusing on the coupling between collective and intrinsic degrees of freedom during the fission process.  Specific attention will be paid to the impact of shell effects on the fission barrier height and shape, highlighting how quantum shell structure influences the stability of fissioning nuclei and the distribution of fission fragments. We will also briefly address the implications of quantum mechanical calculations for predicting fission fragment yields and their associated kinetic energies.  Furthermore, we will touch upon the challenges and limitations of current computational methods in accurately modelling the complex quantum dynamics of fission, and suggest potential avenues for future research, including the integration of advanced many-body techniques and improved nuclear interaction potentials.  The goal is to illuminate the fundamental quantum aspects underlying this complex nuclear process.
