Quantum entanglement describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  Unlike classical correlations, which can be explained by shared properties established prior to measurement, entangled systems exhibit correlations that cannot be attributed to pre-existing local realism.  This is formalized mathematically through the violation of Bell inequalities, demonstrating that entangled states cannot be represented by a local hidden-variable theory.

Entanglement arises from the superposition principle.  When two or more particles interact, their individual quantum states become intertwined, forming a composite state described by a joint wavefunction. This wavefunction cannot be factored into separate wavefunctions for each particle; the particles' states are intrinsically linked.  A measurement on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, regardless of spatial separation, a phenomenon seemingly at odds with locality but not violating causality as no information can be transmitted faster than light.  The observed correlations arise from the projective measurement of the composite system onto a specific basis state, collapsing the wavefunction and determining the definite states of all entangled particles.  This non-local correlation forms the basis for many emerging quantum technologies.
