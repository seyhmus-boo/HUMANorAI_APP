Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in stellar evolution, dictated by the interplay of gravity and internal pressure.  Stars, akin to immense pressure cookers, maintain hydrostatic equilibrium through nuclear fusion, counteracting their own immense gravitational pull. When a sufficiently massive star (typically >8 solar masses) exhausts its nuclear fuel, this equilibrium collapses.  Imagine a tightly wound spring suddenly losing its tension; the star's core implodes catastrophically.

For stars within a specific mass range, this implosion leads to a neutron star, where the incredible density prevents further collapse, analogous to a super-compressed ball of neutrons resisting further squeezing.  However, in stars exceeding a critical mass (approximately 25 solar masses), even the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is insufficient to halt the collapse. Gravity's relentless pull overcomes all resistance, resulting in a singularity â€“ a point of infinite density, conceptually like infinitely compressing the entire Earth into a pinpoint.  This singularity is shrouded by an event horizon, a boundary from beyond which even light cannot escape, forming the black hole.  The process can be visualized as a bottomless pit, where gravity's pull is so strong that nothing, not even light, can climb out. The surrounding matter then accretes onto the black hole, often forming a swirling accretion disk, a vibrant cosmic whirlpool feeding the singularity.
