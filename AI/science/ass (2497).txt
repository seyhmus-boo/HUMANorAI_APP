Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This linkage transcends classical physics; measuring the property of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of its partner, even across vast distances.  This correlation surpasses any explanation based on local realism.

Einstein famously referred to this as "spooky action at a distance," highlighting its counter-intuitive nature.  The underlying mechanism involves the particles' shared quantum state, described by a wave function encompassing both.  Measurement collapses this wave function, instantaneously determining the properties of all entangled particles.

This seemingly paradoxical phenomenon holds significant practical implications.  Quantum entanglement forms the bedrock of quantum computing, promising exponentially faster computations than classical computers.  Furthermore, it underpins quantum cryptography, offering unconditionally secure communication channels impervious to eavesdropping.  Finally, advancements in quantum teleportation, enabled by entanglement, could revolutionize long-distance information transfer. While still in its nascent stages, the potential applications of quantum entanglement are vast and transformative.
