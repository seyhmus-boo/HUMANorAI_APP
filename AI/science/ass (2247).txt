Black hole formation represents a critical juncture in stellar evolution and a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  This paper investigates the diverse mechanisms leading to the creation of these enigmatic objects, focusing on the interplay between stellar mass, rotation, and magnetic fields.  We review the established theoretical framework of gravitational collapse, detailing the conditions required for the formation of both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  Particular emphasis is placed on the role of core-collapse supernovae in the formation of stellar-mass black holes, examining the influence of progenitor star characteristics on the final black hole mass and spin.  Furthermore, we explore alternative formation pathways, including direct collapse scenarios for supermassive black holes and the potential contribution of mergers and accretion.  This review synthesizes recent advancements in numerical simulations, observational data from gravitational wave astronomy and electromagnetic counterparts, and theoretical modelling to provide a comprehensive overview of our current understanding of black hole formation across the cosmological mass spectrum and its implications for galaxy evolution.  Ultimately, this study highlights remaining open questions and future research directions in this dynamic field.
