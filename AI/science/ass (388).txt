Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission, the process underpinning nuclear power generation.  Imagine a bowling ball (a uranium-235 nucleus) rolling down a lane (representing the nucleus's energy state).  This ball is inherently unstable, teetering precariously.  Now, imagine a tiny marble (a neutron) striking the bowling ball. This impact provides the necessary nudge to destabilize the system.

The bowling ball, upon impact, doesn't just wobble; it violently shatters into smaller balls (fission fragments – lighter nuclei) and releases several more marbles (neutrons).  Crucially, these smaller balls possess considerable kinetic energy, released as heat – the energy harnessed in nuclear reactors.  Furthermore, the released marbles can then strike other bowling balls, initiating a chain reaction, a self-sustaining cascade of fission events.  This chain reaction, if uncontrolled, can lead to an exponential increase in energy release, as seen in a nuclear explosion.  Control is achieved through the careful regulation of neutron absorption, essentially slowing down the marbles to prevent overwhelming the system.  The efficiency and safety of nuclear fission lie in precisely managing this delicate chain reaction.
