Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, comprises two interconnected stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The light-dependent reactions, analogous to a hydroelectric dam, harness light energy to generate ATP and NADPH.  Chlorophyll molecules, acting as the dam's turbines, capture photons, exciting electrons to a higher energy level. This electron flow, akin to water rushing through the dam, drives the synthesis of ATP through photophosphorylation – a process comparable to the generation of electricity.  Simultaneously, water is split (photolysis), releasing oxygen as a byproduct –  the dam's “waste product”.

The light-independent reactions, comparable to a factory assembly line, utilize the ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into glucose.  The enzyme RuBisCO, the factory's foreman, catalyzes this carbon fixation.  This process, involving a series of enzymatic reactions, consumes ATP and NADPH to build sugar molecules – the factory's “finished product” – from the raw material of carbon dioxide. This intricate interplay between light-harvesting and carbon fixation ensures the efficient conversion of solar energy into the chemical energy underpinning most ecosystems.
