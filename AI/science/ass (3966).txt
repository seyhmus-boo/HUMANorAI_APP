Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional material properties stemming from their unique sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon bonding.  Their high aspect ratio and strong covalent bonding contribute to exceptional tensile strength, significantly exceeding that of steel.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate remarkable Young's modulus, indicating exceptional stiffness and resistance to deformation.  Electrical conductivity varies significantly depending on chirality, with metallic nanotubes exhibiting conductivities comparable to copper, while semiconducting nanotubes demonstrate tunable band gaps.  This variability in electrical properties allows for applications in both conductive and semiconducting devices.  Thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high along the nanotube axis, enabling efficient heat dissipation.  Finally, CNTs possess a large surface area-to-volume ratio, resulting in significant adsorption capabilities, which find utility in various sensing and catalysis applications.  These remarkable properties, coupled with their potential for functionalization and integration into composite materials, position CNTs as a key material for numerous advanced technological applications.
