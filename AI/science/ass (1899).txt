Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  The initial theoretical groundwork was laid by Laplace in the late 18th century, who posited "dark stars" formed by gravity exceeding the escape velocity of light.  However, Einstein's General Relativity in the early 20th century provided the rigorous framework for understanding black hole physics, describing them as regions of spacetime with such intense gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape.

The process begins with a massive star (typically exceeding 20 solar masses) exhausting its nuclear fuel.  Without the outward pressure from fusion to counteract gravity, the core undergoes catastrophic implosion.  If the core's mass surpasses the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, electron degeneracy pressure fails to prevent further collapse, resulting in a singularityâ€”a point of infinite density.  This singularity is shrouded by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which escape is impossible.  The surrounding stellar material either accretes onto the black hole or is expelled in a powerful supernova explosion.  Alternative formation mechanisms, such as the collapse of dense stellar clusters or primordial black holes formed in the early universe, are also considered, albeit with less observational evidence.
