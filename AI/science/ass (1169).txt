Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two lighter nuclei.  Imagine a carefully balanced ball perched atop a hill representing a large, unstable nucleus.  This ball possesses significant potential energy.  A small nudge, analogous to the absorption of a neutron, disrupts the equilibrium, causing the ball to roll down the hill, rapidly losing potential energy and gaining kinetic energy. This "roll" represents the fission process itself, where the nucleus violently fragments.

The splitting releases a tremendous amount of energy, much like the kinetic energy of the ball at the bottom of the hill.  This energy manifests as heat and the emission of further neutrons, those "offspring" of the fission event. These newly released neutrons, in turn, can act as further "nudges," initiating chain reactions â€“ like a cascade of balls rolling down the hill, causing a widespread and self-sustaining release of energy. The exact path of the "roll," and thus the resulting daughter nuclei, is not deterministic; various fission products are produced, but the total energy released remains remarkably consistent.  Controlling this chain reaction is crucial for harnessing the energy of fission in a controlled manner, as seen in nuclear power plants.
