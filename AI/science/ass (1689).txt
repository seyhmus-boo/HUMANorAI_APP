Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have garnered significant attention for their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, promising transformative applications in diverse fields from electronics to materials science.  However, realizing the full potential of CNTs remains hampered by significant experimental challenges.  This paper focuses on these crucial limitations, exploring the difficulties associated with achieving precise control over CNT synthesis, characterization, and manipulation.  Specifically, we address the challenges inherent in producing large quantities of CNTs with consistent structural parameters, including diameter, chirality, and length, which critically impact their final properties.  Furthermore, we examine the difficulties in accurately characterizing these parameters, particularly the determination of chirality, necessitating advanced techniques with limited accessibility and often producing ambiguous results.  Finally, we discuss the complexities of integrating CNTs into functional devices, encompassing challenges related to dispersion, alignment, and the creation of robust and scalable fabrication processes.  Overcoming these experimental limitations is paramount to unlocking the true potential of CNTs and enabling widespread technological implementation.
