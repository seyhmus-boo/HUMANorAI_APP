Nuclear fission, the splitting of an atomic nucleus, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Its historical roots lie in the 1930s, with the work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann demonstrating the unexpected fission of uranium nuclei following neutron bombardment.  Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch subsequently provided the theoretical explanation, invoking the liquid drop model to elucidate the process.

This process releases a tremendous amount of energy, stemming from the mass defect governed by Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  Fission typically involves the bombardment of heavy, fissile isotopes like Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239 with neutrons.  This induces instability, causing the nucleus to split into lighter daughter nuclei, releasing further neutrons and significant energy in the form of kinetic energy and gamma radiation.  The liberated neutrons can then trigger further fission events in a chain reaction, the foundation of nuclear reactors and weapons.  Careful control of this chain reaction is crucial in power generation, whereas uncontrolled chain reactions characterize nuclear explosions. The subsequent development of nuclear technology, driven by fission, has profoundly impacted both energy production and geopolitical landscapes.
