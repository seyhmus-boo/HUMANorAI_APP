Nuclear fission is the process whereby a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and free neutrons. This process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the nucleus to become unstable and subsequently undergo fission. The released neutrons can then trigger further fission events in a chain reaction, resulting in a self-sustaining nuclear reaction.  The energy released stems from the mass defect, governed by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²), where a small amount of mass is converted into a considerable amount of energy.  The energy manifests as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted radiation.

This powerful energy release has found practical applications primarily in nuclear power generation. Fission reactors utilize controlled chain reactions to produce heat, which is then used to generate steam and drive turbines, producing electricity.  Furthermore, the high energy neutrons produced during fission are utilized in various applications such as materials science (neutron activation analysis) and medical treatments (neutron capture therapy).  However, the inherent risks associated with radioactivity and the potential for catastrophic accidents necessitate rigorous safety protocols and responsible waste management strategies in the practical applications of nuclear fission.
