Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of spatial separation. This interconnectedness surpasses classical correlations, exhibiting strong correlations that violate Bell's inequalities.  The entangled state cannot be factored into individual states of the constituent systems, manifesting as a holistic entity.  Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, a feature seemingly at odds with locality but consistent with the predictions of quantum theory.  

The theoretical framework explaining entanglement relies on the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of Hilbert spaces.  Different entanglement types exist, ranging from maximally entangled Bell states to less correlated mixed states,  characterized by measures like entanglement entropy and concurrence.  Experimentally, entanglement has been demonstrated across various systems, including photons, ions, and superconducting circuits, with high fidelity.  Despite its counterintuitive nature, entanglement forms the basis for promising quantum technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography, leveraging its unique properties for information processing and secure communication.  Further exploration of entanglement's fundamental aspects continues to be a crucial area of research within quantum mechanics.
