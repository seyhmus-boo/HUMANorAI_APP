Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition.  In quantum mechanics, a system of two or more particles can exist in a combined state, an entangled state, where the properties of individual particles are not independently defined.  Instead, their properties are correlated.  This correlation isn't simply a matter of pre-existing, hidden variables;  it's a fundamental aspect of the quantum wavefunction describing the composite system.

Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the outcome of a corresponding measurement on the other, regardless of spatial separation.  This non-local correlation, famously highlighted by the EPR paradox, does not violate causality because no information can be transmitted faster than light.  The correlation is established at the moment of entanglement, and the specific outcome of a measurement remains probabilistic until the measurement is performed. This profound interconnectedness, a direct consequence of superposition and the tensor product structure of Hilbert spaces, continues to be a source of both fascination and ongoing research in quantum information science.
