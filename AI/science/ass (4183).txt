Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise across diverse technological fields.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains elusive, leading to heterogeneous samples with variations in chirality, diameter, and length, complicating property characterization and hindering reproducible results.  Furthermore, achieving high purity CNTs free from catalyst residues and amorphous carbon is difficult, impacting their performance and limiting scalability.  Accurate measurement of individual CNT properties, particularly mechanical strength and thermal conductivity, poses significant difficulties due to the nanoscale dimensions and the need for sophisticated techniques like atomic force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy.  Challenges also extend to manipulating and assembling CNTs into macroscopic structures for practical applications, demanding advanced techniques like dielectrophoresis and controlled self-assembly.  Overcoming these experimental hurdles is crucial for unlocking the full potential of CNTs and translating their remarkable properties into commercially viable technologies.
