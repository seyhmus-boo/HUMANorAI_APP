Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, is a process underpinned by the interplay of strong and electromagnetic forces.  Heavier nuclei, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, possess a relatively low binding energy per nucleon compared to their fission fragments.  This energy imbalance drives the fission process, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  The process is initiated by neutron absorption, which causes the nucleus to become unstable and undergo deformation.  This deformation overcomes the strong nuclear force, leading to scission and the release of further neutrons, potentially triggering a chain reaction.  The number of neutrons released per fission event, coupled with the probability of neutron capture, dictates the criticality of the system.  Variations in fission fragment yields are observed, depending on the fissile nucleus and incident neutron energy, leading to a complex distribution of radioactive products.  Precise modeling of these processes requires sophisticated computational techniques, given the complex interplay of nuclear forces and statistical distributions involved.
