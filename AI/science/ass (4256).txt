Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure.  Their sp² hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, analogous to a tightly rolled-up sheet of graphene, confer exceptional mechanical strength.  Imagine a single, flawlessly woven thread of incredible tensile strength – this illustrates the high Young's modulus of CNTs.  Their high aspect ratio, like a very long and thin needle, contributes to their remarkable flexibility and ability to withstand bending stresses.

Electrically, CNTs can behave as either metallic conductors or semiconductors, depending on their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's roll), akin to a switch controlling conductivity.  This property is influenced by the subtle arrangement of the carbon atoms, mirroring how a slight change in crystal structure can drastically alter a material's electronic behaviour.  Furthermore, their high surface area, comparable to a densely packed forest of incredibly thin fibers, facilitates exceptional adsorption capabilities, making them useful in various applications like catalysis and gas storage.  These combined properties render CNTs attractive for diverse technological advancements.
