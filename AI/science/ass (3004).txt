Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, comprises two principal stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The light-dependent reactions, analogous to a hydroelectric dam, harness light energy using chlorophyll and other pigments.  These pigments act as "water wheels," capturing photons and exciting electrons to a higher energy level. This energy is then used to generate ATP, the cell's energy currency, and NADPH, a reducing agent, akin to storing water behind the dam for later use.  Water molecules are split in this process, releasing oxygen as a byproduct â€“ the "overflow" from the dam.

The light-independent reactions, comparable to a factory utilizing the stored energy, utilize the ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into glucose.  This process, catalyzed by the enzyme Rubisco,  can be likened to an assembly line, where CO2 molecules are gradually converted into more complex sugars through a series of carefully regulated enzymatic steps.  This "factory" requires continuous energy input from the "dam" (light-dependent reactions) to operate effectively.  Ultimately, the entire photosynthetic process efficiently converts solar energy into the chemical energy stored within glucose, fueling plant growth and serving as the foundation of most terrestrial ecosystems.
