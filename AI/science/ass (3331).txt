Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them attractive for diverse applications.  Their high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility, has driven advancements in composite materials, enhancing strength-to-weight ratios significantly. Recent research focuses on precisely controlling CNT chirality and diameter during synthesis, enabling the tailoring of electronic properties from metallic to semiconducting behavior. This precise control is crucial for advanced electronic device fabrication, including high-performance transistors and flexible sensors.  Moreover, significant progress has been made in scalable and cost-effective production methods, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and floating catalyst techniques, addressing a previous limitation to widespread adoption.  However, challenges remain in addressing long-term stability and potential toxicity concerns.  Current research emphasizes functionalization strategies to improve CNT dispersibility and biocompatibility, while investigations into their environmental impact continue.  The ongoing exploration of CNT properties and scalable synthesis methods promises to unlock their full potential across numerous technological domains.
