Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns the formation of black holes, a fascinating subject with a rich history.  Early theoretical groundwork, stemming from Laplace's 18th-century "dark stars," predicted the possibility of objects so gravitationally dense that even light could not escape. However, the modern understanding emerged in the 20th century with Einstein's General Theory of Relativity. This theory provided the mathematical framework to describe black holes as regions of spacetime with extreme gravitational curvature.

Black hole formation is primarily associated with the stellar lifecycle.  Massive stars, those exceeding approximately eight solar masses, exhaust their nuclear fuel and collapse under their own gravity.  This collapse, if sufficiently compact, overcomes electron degeneracy pressure and neutron degeneracy pressure, leading to the formation of a singularity – a point of infinite density – at the center, surrounded by the event horizon. This process, often dramatic and potentially involving supernovae, ultimately gives rise to a black hole.  Alternative formation mechanisms, such as the collapse of supermassive stars or the merging of dense stellar remnants, are also considered, though their specifics remain areas of active research.
