Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, continue to be the subject of intense research.  Their unique cylindrical structure, comprising seamlessly bonded spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, leads to exceptionally high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel at a significantly lower density.  Electrical conductivity varies dramatically depending on chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, enabling diverse applications in electronics.  High thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation.

Recent developments focus on controlled synthesis techniques, enabling precise manipulation of CNT chirality and diameter distribution, leading to improved performance in targeted applications.  Advances in functionalization strategies allow for enhanced solubility and integration with other materials, broadening their applicability in composites and biomedicine.  Furthermore, research explores the potential of CNT-based sensors, with high sensitivity and selectivity demonstrated for various analytes.  Challenges remain in scaling up production cost-effectively and addressing potential toxicity concerns, particularly regarding long-term biological effects.  Nevertheless, ongoing advancements in synthesis, functionalization, and characterization techniques promise to unlock the full potential of CNTs across numerous technological sectors.
