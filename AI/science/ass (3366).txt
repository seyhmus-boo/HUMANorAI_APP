DNA replication, the process by which a cell creates an identical copy of its DNA, is a fundamental biological process crucial for cell division and heredity.  Early understanding of its mechanism was hampered by a lack of sophisticated techniques.  However, pioneering work by researchers like Chargaff, who established base-pairing rules, and Franklin and Wilkins, who elucidated DNA's double helix structure, laid the groundwork for the subsequent elucidation of the replication process.  The semi-conservative model, proposed by Watson and Crick and later experimentally confirmed by Meselson and Stahl, established that each new DNA molecule retains one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.

The process itself involves several key enzymes, including helicase, which unwinds the DNA double helix; primase, which synthesizes RNA primers; DNA polymerase, which adds nucleotides to the growing strand; and ligase, which joins Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.  The intricate choreography of these enzymes ensures high fidelity replication, although errors can occur and are addressed by cellular repair mechanisms.  Understanding DNA replication has not only revolutionized our comprehension of heredity but also underpins advancements in biotechnology, such as PCR and gene sequencing. Ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of this vital process, particularly regarding its regulation and error correction mechanisms.
