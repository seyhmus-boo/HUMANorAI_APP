Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel, stellar cores exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 solar masses) are unable to withstand their own gravity.  This leads to a runaway collapse, compressing the core to an infinitesimally small point of infinite density – a singularity – surrounded by an event horizon. While the classical picture involves the direct collapse of massive stars, recent advancements have refined our understanding.  Gravitational wave observations by LIGO and Virgo have directly detected mergers of stellar-mass black holes, confirming theoretical predictions and providing unprecedented data on their masses and spins.  Furthermore, numerical simulations, incorporating more realistic equations of state and magnetic fields, have shed light on the intricate processes during core collapse, particularly the role of jets and outflows in the final stages.  These simulations have revealed a greater diversity in the formation pathways than previously anticipated, including the possibility of direct collapse black holes from primordial gas clouds, bypassing the stellar evolution phase entirely.  Continued advancements in observational techniques and computational power promise further refinement of our comprehension of these enigmatic cosmic objects.
