Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, are cylindrical nanostructures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.  Their unique morphology imparts exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, leading to extensive research and potential applications across diverse fields.  CNTs exhibit exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, significantly surpassing steel.  Their electrical conductivity varies depending on chirality, with some behaving as metallic conductors and others as semiconductors, offering tunability for electronic devices.  High thermal conductivity along the tube axis facilitates efficient heat dissipation.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT synthesis to achieve desired chirality and structural uniformity, as well as overcoming difficulties in scalable production and processing.  Furthermore,  concerns regarding their potential toxicity necessitate further investigation.  Despite these challenges, ongoing research continues to explore the potential of CNTs in diverse applications, including composites, electronics, energy storage, and biomedical engineering, promising transformative advancements across numerous technological domains.
