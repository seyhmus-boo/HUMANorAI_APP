While classical biochemistry adequately describes the overall mechanism of DNA replication, a complete understanding necessitates incorporating quantum mechanical effects.  The process relies on highly specific hydrogen bonding between base pairs, a phenomenon fundamentally governed by quantum electrodynamics (QED).  The subtle variations in electron distribution within the bases, influencing their dipole moments and polarizability, subtly affect hydrogen bond strength and thus fidelity.  Furthermore, quantum tunneling plays a role in proton transfer events crucial for tautomeric shifts, which can lead to mispairing and mutations.  The accuracy of DNA polymerase, a remarkable molecular machine, likely exploits quantum coherence to navigate the complex conformational landscape of its active site, optimizing substrate binding and catalysis.  Recent studies suggest that entanglement between electron spins within the enzyme's catalytic center might contribute to its efficiency.  Investigating these quantum effects, though experimentally challenging, could offer deeper insight into the remarkable precision and speed of DNA replication, and potentially inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting DNA replication errors.  Further research is needed to fully elucidate the extent of quantum mechanical influence on this fundamental biological process.
