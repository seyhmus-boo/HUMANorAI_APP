Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon first predicted by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in their seminal 1935 paper, describes a peculiar correlation between two or more quantum systems.  The EPR paradox, highlighting the seemingly paradoxical non-locality of entangled particles, posited that quantum mechanics was incomplete, lacking hidden variables to explain these correlations.  However, subsequent experiments, notably those conducted by Alain Aspect in the 1980s, demonstrably violated Bell's inequalities, a mathematical framework developed to test the predictions of local realism against quantum mechanics. These experimental results strongly support the validity of quantum entanglement and its non-local nature, refuting the EPR hypothesis of hidden variables.  Entanglement manifests as a strong correlation between the measured properties of two or more particles, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  Once entangled, measuring the state of one particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, even across vast distances. This counterintuitive behavior has significant implications for quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and our fundamental understanding of the nature of reality, continuing to be a subject of intense theoretical and experimental research.
