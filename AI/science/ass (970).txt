Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a pivotal area of scientific inquiry with far-reaching implications for energy production, nuclear medicine, and national security.  This paper provides a comprehensive review of the fundamental mechanisms governing nuclear fission processes, focusing on both spontaneous and induced fission.  We examine the interplay of nuclear forces, shell effects, and collective excitations in determining fission fragment distributions and energy release.  A detailed analysis of the theoretical frameworks used to model fission, including statistical models and microscopic approaches based on density functional theory, is presented.  Furthermore, the paper explores recent advancements in our understanding of the dynamics of fission, with particular emphasis on the role of pre-scission and post-scission phenomena, such as neutron emission and gamma-ray cascades.  The review concludes by highlighting key outstanding challenges and future research directions, including the development of more accurate and computationally efficient theoretical models, the exploration of novel fission pathways in exotic nuclei, and the optimization of fission reactor designs for enhanced efficiency and safety.
