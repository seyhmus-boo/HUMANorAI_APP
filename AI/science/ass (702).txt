Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, traditionally relies on classical general relativity. However, the singularity at the black hole's core necessitates a quantum mechanical treatment to resolve the information paradox and fully comprehend the process. This presentation explores the quantum aspects of black hole formation, focusing on the interplay between gravitational collapse and quantum field theory in curved spacetime. We will delve into the role of Hawking radiation, examining its implications for information loss and the potential for a quantum description of black hole evaporation.  Furthermore, we will discuss emergent models attempting to unify general relativity and quantum mechanics in the context of black hole formation, including loop quantum gravity and string theory. These approaches offer alternative descriptions of spacetime at the Planck scale, potentially resolving the singularity issue and offering insights into the pre- and post-formation states.  Finally, we will briefly address the challenges and open questions remaining in this field, highlighting the need for further theoretical and observational investigation to fully understand the quantum nature of black hole genesis.
