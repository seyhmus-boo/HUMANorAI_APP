Quantum entanglement is a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This arises from the superposition principle; a composite system can exist in a superposition of entangled states, not simply as a product of individual system states.  Mathematically, this is represented by a wavefunction that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each subsystem.  

Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the outcome of a measurement on the other, even across vast distances.  This does not violate special relativity because no information is transmitted faster than light; the correlation is established upon creation of the entangled state, not during measurement.  The measured property is not pre-determined; rather, the act of measurement on one particle collapses the wavefunction of the entire entangled system, instantaneously defining the properties of all constituent particles.  This strong correlation contrasts sharply with classical physics, where correlations are always explainable by local realistic theories.  Bell's theorem experimentally confirms the non-locality inherent in entanglement, establishing its profound departure from classical intuition.
