Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems exhibit correlated behaviour, irrespective of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation transcends classical physics, as the entangled particles share a unified quantum state, such that measuring the property of one instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of distance.  This non-local correlation does not violate causality, as no information is transmitted faster than light.

Recent developments significantly advance our understanding and application of entanglement.  Experimental advancements in generating and manipulating entangled photons and ions have led to the creation of increasingly complex entangled states, pushing the boundaries of quantum computing and communication.  Developments in quantum error correction codes, leveraging the properties of entanglement, show promise in building fault-tolerant quantum computers.  Furthermore, research exploring the connection between entanglement and gravity is opening up new avenues of investigation in quantum gravity and cosmology.  The increasing sophistication of experimental techniques promises further breakthroughs in harnessing the power of entanglement for practical applications in the near future.
