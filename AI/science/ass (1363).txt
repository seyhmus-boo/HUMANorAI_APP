Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and additional neutrons.  This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the daughter nuclei and emitted neutrons is less than the original nucleus, with the mass difference converted to energy according to Einstein's E=mcÂ².  The emitted neutrons can then induce further fission events in a chain reaction, providing a self-sustaining process crucial for nuclear power generation.  The chain reaction's rate is controlled in reactors using neutron-absorbing materials.

Fission processes are exploited in various applications. Primarily, they are harnessed in nuclear power plants to generate electricity, providing a carbon-free energy source albeit with associated challenges regarding nuclear waste management and reactor safety.  Furthermore, fission plays a critical role in the production of medical isotopes used in diagnostic imaging and cancer therapy, contributing significantly to advancements in healthcare.  Finally, despite ethical concerns, fission has been utilized in the development of nuclear weapons, highlighting both the immense potential and inherent dangers of this process.  Ongoing research focuses on improving reactor efficiency, minimizing waste production, and enhancing the safety of fission technologies.
