Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  These systems, even when spatially separated, exhibit a stronger-than-classical correlation in their respective properties.  Measurement of a specific observable on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the outcome of a corresponding measurement on the other, regardless of the distance separating them.  This phenomenon, often misinterpreted as faster-than-light communication, does not violate causality as no information can be transmitted faster than light.  Entanglement arises from the superposition principle and the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum states, where the composite system exists in a superposition of entangled states until a measurement collapses the wave function. The degree of entanglement is quantified using measures such as entanglement entropy or concurrence.  This counterintuitive phenomenon has profound implications for quantum information science, forming the basis of quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation protocols, enabling advancements in computation and secure communication beyond the classical realm.  Ongoing research focuses on understanding the fundamental limits of entanglement and developing robust methods for generating and manipulating entangled states for technological applications.
