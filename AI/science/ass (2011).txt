Photosynthesis, the process underpinning most life on Earth, has captivated scientists for centuries.  Early understanding, dating back to the 17th century with van Helmont's willow tree experiment, focused on the role of water and soil.  Later, Ingenhousz demonstrated the light-dependency of the process, laying the groundwork for future investigations.  The 20th century saw a revolution in our comprehension, with the elucidation of the light-dependent and light-independent (Calvin-Benson) cycles.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of the core mechanisms driving photosynthesis.  We will explore the critical roles of photosystems I and II, including the intricate electron transport chain and its generation of ATP and NADPH.  Further, we will examine the carbon fixation pathways, focusing on the RuBisCO enzyme and its significance in the Calvin cycle.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the diversity of photosynthetic mechanisms across different organisms, highlighting variations in pigment utilization and carbon concentrating mechanisms as adaptations to diverse environmental conditions. This presentation aims to provide a foundational understanding of photosynthesis, connecting historical discoveries with current knowledge.
