Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms. This presentation will explore the key properties that make CNTs attractive for a wide range of applications.  We will examine their exceptional mechanical strength, exhibiting tensile strengths far exceeding steel, and high elastic modulus, making them ideal for reinforcement composites.  Their remarkable electrical conductivity, with variations depending on chirality, ranges from metallic to semiconducting behaviour, offering potential in electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate exceptional thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation in various devices.

The presentation will also briefly touch upon the challenges associated with CNT research.  These include issues related to scalable production, purification, and the effective dispersion of CNTs within composite matrices.  Despite these challenges, ongoing research continues to address these limitations, paving the way for widespread commercial exploitation. Finally, we will discuss current and future research directions focusing on harnessing CNTs' unique properties for applications in energy storage, biomedical devices, and advanced materials engineering.
