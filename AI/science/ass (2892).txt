Good morning. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, a fundamental process in all life.  Early understanding of heredity, predating the identification of DNA as the genetic material, hinted at a mechanism of self-duplication.  However, the elucidation of DNA's double-helical structure by Watson and Crick in 1953 provided the crucial framework.  Their model immediately suggested a semi-conservative mechanism: each strand acts as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.

This process, as we now understand, is initiated at specific origin sites and proceeds bidirectionally along the DNA molecule.  Helicases unwind the double helix, while topoisomerases relieve torsional stress.  DNA polymerase, the key enzyme, adds nucleotides to the growing strand, synthesizing in a 5' to 3' direction. Leading and lagging strands are formed due to the antiparallel nature of DNA, with the latter requiring Okazaki fragments and ligase for completion.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerase.  The replicated DNA then undergoes rigorous quality control before cell division.  This remarkable process ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information across generations.
