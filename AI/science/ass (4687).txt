Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, promising revolutionary advancements across diverse fields.  However, the full realization of their potential is hampered by considerable experimental challenges.  This paper focuses on the key limitations encountered in the precise characterization and manipulation of CNTs, hindering a complete understanding of their properties and hindering their widespread application.  The inherent structural complexity of CNTs, including variations in diameter, chirality, and degree of structural defects, presents a significant hurdle in achieving consistent and reproducible results.  Furthermore, the challenges associated with the purification and separation of CNTs into homogenous samples with well-defined characteristics remain a major obstacle.  This often leads to a broad distribution of properties within a seemingly single sample, obscuring the intrinsic attributes of individual CNTs.  Finally, the precise control and manipulation of individual CNTs, particularly for advanced applications such as nanoelectronics, poses significant technical difficulties.  This review will critically examine these experimental challenges and explore emerging strategies aimed at overcoming these limitations, paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding and effective utilization of CNTs' remarkable properties.
