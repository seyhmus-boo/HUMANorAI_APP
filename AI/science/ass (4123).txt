Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges associated with CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing, despite its revolutionary potential.  While CRISPR offers unprecedented precision in targeting specific DNA sequences, several hurdles remain. Off-target effects, where the Cas9 enzyme cleaves unintended genomic locations, represent a significant concern.  Minimising these requires meticulous guide RNA design and careful selection of Cas9 variants with enhanced specificity.  Furthermore, efficient delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system into target cells remains a major obstacle, varying significantly depending on the organism and tissue type.  Viral vectors, while efficient, pose immunogenicity concerns, while non-viral methods often struggle with low transfection rates.  Finally, the assessment of editing outcomes necessitates sophisticated analytical techniques, including next-generation sequencing and specialized assays, to comprehensively characterise both intended edits and potential off-target effects. Overcoming these experimental challenges is paramount to realizing the full therapeutic and research potential of CRISPR technology.
