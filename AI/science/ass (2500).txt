Catalysts in organic chemistry are substances that dramatically accelerate reaction rates without being consumed themselves.  They achieve this by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy, analogous to finding a shorter, less steep route up a mountain.  Instead of forcing reactants over a high-energy barrier, the catalyst facilitates a gentler ascent, allowing the reaction to proceed more readily.

This often involves the catalyst forming a temporary intermediate complex with one or more reactants.  Imagine a matchmaker introducing two initially reluctant individuals (reactants); the matchmaker (catalyst) interacts with each, facilitating their interaction and subsequently withdrawing without being changed themselves.  This intermediate complex may involve changes in the electronic structure or spatial arrangement of the reactants, weakening bonds and enabling bond formation with a lower energy input.

The catalytic cycle reiterates, allowing a single catalyst molecule to influence multiple reactions, leading to substantial rate enhancements.  The specificity of catalysts further resembles a lock-and-key mechanism:  only specific reactants (the "keys") will fit the active site of the catalyst ("lock"), ensuring selectivity in the reaction.  Different catalysts offer alternative pathways, allowing chemists to selectively form desired products from the same starting materials.
