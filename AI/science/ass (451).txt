Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991 through transmission electron microscopy, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure.  These cylindrical molecules, essentially rolled-up graphene sheets, exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNTs).  Their mechanical properties are remarkable, boasting tensile strength exceeding that of steel and high elastic modulus, making them ideal for reinforcement in composite materials.  

Electrically, CNTs display intriguing behaviour. SWCNTs can be metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's roll-up), while MWCNTs generally exhibit metallic conductivity.  This tunable conductivity, alongside their high carrier mobility, holds immense potential for nanoelectronics applications.  Furthermore, CNTs possess significant thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper along the nanotube axis, and exhibit high surface area, leading to applications in energy storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in scalable, controlled synthesis and the dispersion of CNTs in matrices for practical implementation. Ongoing research focuses on addressing these limitations to fully harness their exceptional potential.
