DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating the genome, is fundamental to life.  Early experiments, notably the Meselson-Stahl experiment (1958), definitively established its semiconservative nature, demonstrating that each daughter DNA molecule retains one parental strand.  This contrasted with conservative and dispersive models then under consideration.  The process is initiated at specific origins of replication, where helicase unwinds the double helix, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins (SSBs) prevent reannealing, while topoisomerases relieve torsional stress.

Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate synthesis.  This enzyme adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to continuous synthesis on the leading strand and discontinuous synthesis on the lagging strand, producing Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the phosphodiester backbone between Okazaki fragments, completing replication.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and mismatch repair mechanisms.  Eukaryotic replication is more complex, involving multiple origins and coordinated regulation to ensure timely and accurate duplication of the vast genome.
