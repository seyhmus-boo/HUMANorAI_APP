Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of spatial separation, presents significant experimental challenges.  The primary hurdle lies in maintaining the coherence of the entangled state.  Environmental decoherence, stemming from interactions with the surrounding electromagnetic fields and thermal fluctuations, rapidly destroys the fragile entanglement, limiting the timescale over which experiments can be performed.  This necessitates the use of sophisticated isolation techniques, such as cryogenic cooling and shielding, which are technically demanding and expensive.

Furthermore, the accurate characterization and verification of entanglement itself pose significant difficulties.  Bell inequality violations, a standard method for confirming entanglement, require high detection efficiencies and precise control over experimental parameters.  Imperfect detectors lead to loopholes that could mimic entanglement, compromising the validity of results. Finally, scaling up entanglement to larger numbers of particles remains a major challenge.  The exponential increase in complexity with the number of qubits necessitates advanced experimental techniques and robust error correction protocols, which are currently under active development.  Overcoming these experimental limitations is crucial for realizing the potential of entanglement in quantum computing and communication technologies.
