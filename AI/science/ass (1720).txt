Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the perplexing phenomenon of quantum entanglement.  Initially predicted by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in their 1935 EPR paradox, entanglement describes a correlation between two or more quantum particles, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation transcends classical physics; measuring the property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, even at vast distances.  This apparent violation of locality, famously dubbed "spooky action at a distance" by Einstein, has been experimentally verified numerous times since the first successful Bell test experiments in the 1970s.  The shared quantum state of entangled particles is described by a single wavefunction, implying a fundamental interconnectedness exceeding our classical intuition.  Entanglement, while seemingly paradoxical, underpins emerging technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography, offering potential for significant advancements in computation and secure communication.  Further research continues to unravel the deeper implications of this extraordinary quantum feature.
