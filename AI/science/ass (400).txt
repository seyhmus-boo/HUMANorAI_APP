Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, traditionally relies on classical general relativity. However, the singularity at the black hole's center presents a clear breakdown of this theory, necessitating a quantum mechanical description. This presentation explores the current understanding of black hole formation through a quantum lens, focusing on the interplay between gravitational collapse and quantum field theory.  We will discuss the implications of Hawking radiation, examining its role in information paradox and its potential contribution to the final stages of black hole evaporation.  Furthermore, we will explore the challenges in constructing a complete quantum theory of gravity, highlighting the limitations of current approaches like loop quantum gravity and string theory in accurately modeling the high-energy density regime of black hole formation.  Specific attention will be given to the role of quantum fluctuations in the early stages of collapse and their potential to modify the classical picture of singularity formation. Finally, we will briefly discuss potential observational signatures that could distinguish between classical and quantum models of black hole formation, paving the way for future research directions.
