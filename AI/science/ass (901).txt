DNA replication, the precise duplication of the genetic material, is fundamental to life, underpinning heredity and cellular proliferation.  This process, while seemingly straightforward in its outcome, involves a complex interplay of enzymes and proteins orchestrated with remarkable fidelity to ensure accurate transmission of genetic information across generations.  For decades, the core mechanisms of DNA replication, including the action of DNA polymerases, helicases, and primases, have been extensively studied. However, recent advancements have significantly refined our understanding of this intricate process.  

Advances in high-throughput sequencing and single-molecule imaging techniques have provided unprecedented insights into the dynamics of replication forks, revealing the complexities of replication initiation, elongation, and termination.  Studies exploring the roles of accessory proteins and their contribution to replication fork stability and stress response have shed light on the mechanisms that maintain genome integrity in the face of challenges such as DNA damage and replication stress.  Furthermore, the burgeoning field of single-cell genomics is enabling the characterization of replication dynamics at the individual cell level, revealing heterogeneity and contributing to our understanding of replication-associated diseases and cancer. This paper will review the classical models of DNA replication, highlighting these recent developments and their implications for our understanding of genome stability and disease.
