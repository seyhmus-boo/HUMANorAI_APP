Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon bonding.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel by several orders of magnitude, coupled with remarkably low density, makes them attractive for high-strength composite materials.  Furthermore, CNTs possess outstanding electrical conductivity, exhibiting metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality, making them promising candidates for next-generation electronics and sensors.  Recent developments have focused on precisely controlling CNT synthesis to achieve desired chirality and diameter distributions, paving the way for tailored functionalities.  Advanced techniques like chemical functionalization, enabling the attachment of specific molecules or polymers, are enhancing their compatibility with various matrices and broadening their applicability.  Moreover, research into scalable production methods, such as floating catalyst chemical vapor deposition, is addressing the challenge of cost-effective mass production.  Ongoing investigations into the intricacies of CNT-based devices, including field-effect transistors and energy storage systems,  are continually revealing novel applications and pushing the boundaries of nanotechnology.
