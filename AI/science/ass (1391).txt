Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, providing a precise and versatile tool for genome editing.  This technology leverages the natural bacterial defense mechanism against bacteriophages, adapting the Cas nuclease (most commonly Cas9) to target specific DNA sequences guided by a short RNA molecule.  The targeted double-stranded break initiates cellular repair pathways, either through non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), leading to insertions or deletions (indels), or homology-directed repair (HDR), allowing precise gene replacement or insertion.  CRISPR-Cas systems offer significant advantages over previous gene editing technologies due to their simplicity, efficiency, and scalability, enabling applications across diverse fields.  Recent advancements have broadened the CRISPR toolkit, including base editors for precise point mutations and prime editors for more complex modifications.  Despite its transformative potential, challenges remain, including off-target effects, delivery efficiency, and ethical considerations.  Ongoing research focuses on optimizing specificity, developing novel Cas enzymes, and exploring therapeutic applications, paving the way for transformative advancements in disease treatment and biotechnology.
