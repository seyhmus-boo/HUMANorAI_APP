Good morning. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, a fundamental process in all living organisms.  Early understanding, predating the elucidation of DNA's double helix structure by Watson and Crick in 1953, hinted at a semi-conservative mechanism.  Meselson and Stahl's elegant experiment in 1958 definitively confirmed this, demonstrating that each new DNA molecule retains one parental strand and one newly synthesized strand.

The process itself is remarkably complex, initiated at specific origin sites by enzymes like helicases, which unwind the double helix.  Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the separated strands, preventing reannealing. DNA polymerase, the central enzyme, synthesizes new strands in a 5' to 3' direction, utilising existing strands as templates.  Because DNA polymerase can only add nucleotides to a pre-existing 3'-OH group, leading strand synthesis is continuous, while lagging strand synthesis is discontinuous, producing Okazaki fragments.  These fragments are subsequently joined by DNA ligase, completing the replication process.  Finally, proofreading mechanisms ensure high fidelity, minimizing errors during replication.  This intricate choreography ensures accurate transmission of genetic information across generations.
