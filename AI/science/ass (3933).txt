Black hole formation represents a pivotal endpoint in stellar evolution, dictated primarily by the initial mass of the progenitor star.  Stars exceeding approximately 20-30 solar masses exhaust their nuclear fuel, culminating in core collapse.  Gravitational instability overwhelms degenerate electron pressure, leading to a runaway implosion.  The core's density increases dramatically, exceeding nuclear density, and forms a singularity, a point of infinite density, at the centre.  Simultaneously, the outer layers of the star are expelled in a spectacular supernova explosion. The remaining collapsed core, possessing sufficient mass to overcome its own gravitational self-interaction, constitutes a black hole.  Less massive stars follow alternative evolutionary paths, ultimately forming neutron stars or white dwarfs.  The precise mass threshold for black hole formation remains an area of ongoing research, influenced by factors such as stellar rotation and magnetic fields, which can affect the mass loss during the supernova phase and thereby influence the remnant's final mass.  Binary star systems offer further complexities, with potential for black hole formation via accretion and merger events.
