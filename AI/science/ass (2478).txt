Good morning. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission, the process underpinning nuclear power generation.  Imagine an atom's nucleus, a tightly bound cluster of protons and neutrons, as a meticulously constructed ball of highly compressed springs.  These "springs" represent the strong nuclear force, holding the nucleus together.  However, certain isotopes, like Uranium-235, are inherently unstable; their "spring system" is precariously balanced.

Introducing a neutron, a small "trigger," into this precarious nucleus is akin to striking a perfectly balanced stack of springs. This disruption causes the nucleus to become violently unstable and fracture, "fissioning" into smaller nuclei.  This fracturing releases a tremendous amount of stored energy – the compressed spring energy suddenly unleashed – analogous to the explosive release of potential energy.  Crucially, this process also releases further neutrons, acting as "triggers" for a chain reaction: one fission event initiates many others, resulting in a sustained release of energy.  Controlling this chain reaction, through careful neutron absorption, is fundamental to safe nuclear power generation.  Failing to manage this chain reaction, however, leads to uncontrolled exponential growth and catastrophic consequences.
