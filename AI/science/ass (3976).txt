Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Its historical roots trace back to the work of Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, who, in 1938, observed the fission of uranium nuclei following neutron bombardment, a phenomenon theoretically explained by Otto Frisch and Meitner. This breakthrough fundamentally altered our understanding of nuclear structure and energy release, demonstrating the immense energy bound within the atom's nucleus.  The process typically involves the absorption of a neutron by a fissile nucleus, leading to an unstable intermediate state that subsequently fragments into two or more smaller nuclei, along with the release of additional neutrons and significant energy, primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and gamma radiation.  The emitted neutrons can trigger further fission events, creating a chain reaction, the basis of nuclear reactors and weapons.  Subsequent research has explored various fissioning isotopes, reactor designs aimed at controlling chain reactions, and the associated challenges of nuclear waste management and proliferation.  Understanding the nuances of fission processes, including variations in fission yields and the spectrum of emitted neutrons, remains crucial for both energy production and nuclear security applications.
