Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing unique electronic and mechanical properties, are extensively studied from a quantum mechanical perspective. Their structure, essentially rolled-up graphene sheets, dictates their properties.  The π-electron system, crucial for understanding CNT behavior, is described using tight-binding models and density functional theory (DFT) calculations.  Chirality, defined by the (n,m) indices describing the rolling vector, significantly influences the electronic band structure. Armchair CNTs (n=m) exhibit metallic conductivity, while zigzag (m=0) and chiral CNTs can be metallic or semiconducting, depending on their (n,m) values. This behavior stems from the quantized momentum of the π-electrons and the resulting band gap formation, directly related to the nanotube diameter and chirality.  Quantum confinement effects, pronounced in smaller diameter CNTs, lead to enhanced energy level spacing.  Furthermore, DFT calculations reveal the strong covalent bonding within the hexagonal lattice and van der Waals interactions between individual nanotubes, impacting their mechanical strength and macroscopic properties.  Understanding these quantum mechanical underpinnings is crucial for leveraging CNTs in advanced applications, such as nanoelectronics and composite materials.
