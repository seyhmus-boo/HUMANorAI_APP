Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with unique cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit a remarkable suite of properties underpinning their interdisciplinary applications.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from the strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds forming their hexagonal lattice, surpasses that of steel, making them attractive for reinforcing composites in materials science and engineering.  Furthermore, CNTs possess extraordinary electrical conductivity,  exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality, a feature crucial for nanoelectronics and sensor development.  This electrical conductivity, coupled with their high surface area, is exploited in energy storage applications, such as lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors,  demonstrating a strong link between materials science and electrochemical engineering.  Their thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, facilitating heat dissipation in microelectronics and offering potential in thermal management systems, bridging materials science and thermodynamics.  Finally, the inherent biocompatibility of certain CNT functionalizations opens avenues in biomedical engineering, with applications ranging from drug delivery vehicles to biosensors, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of CNT research spanning chemistry, biology, and medicine.
