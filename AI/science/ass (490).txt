Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on chemical bonding and molecular structure, fundamental concepts underpinning much of chemistry.  We'll briefly review the classical valence bond and molecular orbital theories, which describe bonding through electron sharing and delocalized orbitals, respectively.  However, our focus will be on recent advancements.

Significant progress has been made in computational chemistry, enabling the accurate prediction of molecular structures and properties for increasingly complex systems.  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, in particular, have revolutionized our ability to study reaction mechanisms and materials science.  Furthermore, advancements in experimental techniques, like X-ray free-electron lasers, allow for the observation of chemical reactions at unprecedented temporal and spatial resolutions, providing critical data to validate and refine theoretical models.  These developments have facilitated deeper understanding of exotic bonding phenomena, including unconventional hydrogen bonds and multi-center bonding in clusters and materials.  The interplay between theory and experiment continues to push the boundaries of our understanding in this field.
