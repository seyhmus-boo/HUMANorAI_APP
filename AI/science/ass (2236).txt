Good morning. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, a fundamental process with profound interdisciplinary implications.  At its core, replication is a biological process: the semiconservative duplication of the DNA molecule, ensuring genetic inheritance.  However, understanding its mechanics requires a deep dive into chemistry.  The intricate enzyme machinery, including DNA polymerase and helicase, operate through precise chemical reactions, drawing on principles of organic chemistry and catalysis.

Furthermore, physics plays a crucial role.  The precise unwinding and rewinding of the double helix, the management of torsional stress, and the interactions between DNA and associated proteins all involve physical forces and principles of molecular mechanics.  Information technology offers another link, as the sheer volume of genomic data necessitates computational biology and sophisticated algorithms for sequencing, assembly, and analysis of replicated DNA.  Ultimately, the study of DNA replication highlights the inherently interdisciplinary nature of modern scientific inquiry.
