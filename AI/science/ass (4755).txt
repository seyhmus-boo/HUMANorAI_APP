Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  Early theoretical work by Laplace and Michell in the 18th century, predating Einstein's general relativity, speculated on the existence of objects with gravity so strong that light could not escape.  However, it was Einstein's theory that provided the robust framework for understanding their formation.

Following stellar evolution, when nuclear fusion ceases in a star exceeding approximately three solar masses, its core collapses under its own immense gravity.  If the core's mass surpasses the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (around 2-3 solar masses), even neutron degeneracy pressure – resisting further collapse – proves insufficient.  This runaway collapse continues until a singularity forms at the center, surrounded by an event horizon – the boundary beyond which nothing, including light, can escape.  The resulting object is a black hole, characterized by its mass, charge, and angular momentum.  Different progenitor stars yield different black hole types: stellar-mass black holes from supernovae, and supermassive black holes, likely formed via accretion of smaller black holes or direct collapse of gas clouds in the early universe.  Observational evidence, such as gravitational waves and X-ray emissions from accretion disks, strengthens the theoretical understanding of black hole formation and evolution.
