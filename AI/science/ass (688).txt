Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, constitutes a fundamental process in nuclear energy generation and weaponry.  This lecture elucidated the underlying mechanics, focusing on the role of neutron bombardment in initiating the process.  Specifically, we examined the critical mass concept, highlighting the necessary quantity of fissile material required to sustain a chain reaction.  The lecture further detailed the various fission products generated, emphasizing their radioactivity and the consequent challenges in nuclear waste management.  Different fissile isotopes, including Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, were contrasted in terms of their fission yields and neutron emission characteristics, influencing reactor design and efficiency.  Finally, the lecture briefly addressed the energy release mechanism, explaining how the mass defect, as predicted by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, manifests as substantial kinetic energy of the fission fragments and subsequently, heat.  Further exploration of advanced reactor designs and improved waste processing strategies remains crucial for the responsible utilization of this powerful energy source.
