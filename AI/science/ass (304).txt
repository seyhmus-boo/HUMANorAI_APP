Good morning. Today's lecture concerns plasma physics phenomena, a field born from the observation of ionized gases,  initially understood through early experiments with gas discharge tubes in the late 19th century.  Sir William Crookes' work, for instance, provided foundational observations of what we now recognize as plasma behaviour.  However, a comprehensive theoretical framework emerged only in the 20th century with the development of kinetic theory and magnetohydrodynamics (MHD).

Plasma, often dubbed the fourth state of matter, distinguishes itself through its collective behaviour arising from the long-range Coulomb interaction between charged particles – ions and electrons.  This leads to a myriad of fascinating phenomena.  We will explore several key aspects, including plasma oscillations, waves (like Langmuir and Alfvén waves), instabilities (e.g., the Rayleigh-Taylor instability), and magnetic confinement.  Understanding these phenomena is crucial for applications ranging from controlled fusion energy to astrophysics, where plasmas constitute the vast majority of visible matter in the universe.  Future lectures will delve deeper into specific examples and theoretical models.
