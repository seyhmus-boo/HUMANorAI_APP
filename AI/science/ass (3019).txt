Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, are cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized structure.  Their structure comprises seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets, forming single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) depending on the number of layers. This structural arrangement dictates their properties.  Mechanically, CNTs exhibit extraordinary tensile strength and elasticity exceeding that of steel, attributed to the strong covalent bonds within the hexagonal lattice.  Electrically, their behaviour is determined by their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet roll-up), exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting properties.  This tunable conductivity makes them promising candidates for nanoelectronics.  Thermally, CNTs display exceptionally high thermal conductivity along their axial direction, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  However, challenges remain in their large-scale production, precise chirality control, and effective dispersion for practical applications, requiring ongoing research into scalable synthesis methods and functionalization techniques to fully harness their remarkable potential across diverse fields including composites, energy storage, and biomedical devices.
