Plasma physics phenomena, while often treated classically, are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles.  The collective behaviour of a plasma, a highly ionized gas, arises from the interactions of its constituent charged particles – electrons and ions – whose dynamics are described by quantum mechanics.  Specifically, the Pauli exclusion principle dictates the behaviour of electrons in degenerate plasmas, significantly influencing their pressure and conductivity at high densities.  Quantum effects also manifest in radiative processes, such as bremsstrahlung and recombination, where the discrete energy levels of atoms and ions lead to characteristic spectral emissions.  Furthermore, quantum electrodynamics (QED) becomes relevant at higher energy densities, influencing processes like electron-positron pair production and annihilation.  The quantum nature of particle interactions, described by scattering cross-sections derived from quantum scattering theory, underpins collisional processes crucial to plasma transport and equilibrium.  Ultimately, a complete understanding of plasma behaviour requires a synthesis of classical and quantum descriptions, with the latter providing a foundational framework for explaining fundamental interactions and properties at relevant scales.
