CRISPR-Cas9 technology has revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient method for genome editing.  Its ease of use and versatility have propelled its application across diverse fields.  This review summarizes CRISPR's impact, highlighting its practical applications.  The system's ability to target specific DNA sequences via guide RNA allows for targeted gene knockouts, knock-ins, and base editing, significantly advancing our capabilities in manipulating genetic material.

In medicine, CRISPR holds immense promise.  Clinical trials are underway for treating genetic disorders like sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia, demonstrating its therapeutic potential.  Beyond gene therapy, CRISPR aids in developing disease models and drug screening, accelerating research and development.  Agricultural applications include enhancing crop yields through increased resistance to pests and diseases, improving nutritional content, and modifying herbicide tolerance.  However, ethical considerations, including off-target effects and potential for misuse, necessitate stringent regulatory frameworks and responsible research practices.  While challenges remain, CRISPR's transformative influence on genetic engineering is undeniable, with far-reaching implications for human health and agriculture.
