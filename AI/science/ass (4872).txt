Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit a unique combination of properties driving interdisciplinary research across materials science, physics, chemistry, and engineering.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from the strong sp² hybridized carbon bonds in their hexagonal lattice, surpasses that of steel on a weight basis, making them attractive for reinforcement in composites.  Remarkably high electrical conductivity, owing to their delocalized π-electrons, positions them as potential replacements for copper in electronics, especially in high-frequency applications.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional thermal conductivity, exceeding that of many metals, facilitating their use in thermal management systems.  Their large surface area to volume ratio, crucial in catalysis and energy storage, allows for significant adsorption of molecules, influencing their application in sensors and energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries.  The diverse functionalities arising from structural variations (single-walled vs. multi-walled, chirality) and surface modifications  (functionalization) further enhance their potential, fostering cross-disciplinary collaborations to explore their applications in biomedical fields (drug delivery), environmental remediation (water purification), and advanced manufacturing processes.  The unique confluence of these properties makes CNTs a subject of intensive ongoing research.
