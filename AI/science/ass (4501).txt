This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, tracing their historical development and outlining key underlying principles.  Beginning with the pioneering work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in the late 1930s, which identified barium as a fission product of uranium, we will explore the subsequent theoretical explanations provided by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, clarifying the concept of nuclear fission and its immense energy release.  The presentation will then delve into the fundamental physics governing the process, focusing on the role of neutron interactions, critical mass, and the various fissionable isotopes, including Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239. We will discuss the different types of fission, such as spontaneous and induced fission, highlighting the significance of neutron moderation and control in sustained chain reactions.  Finally, a brief overview of the technological applications of fission, including nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons, will be presented, acknowledging both the benefits and the inherent challenges associated with this powerful process.  The presentation aims to offer a balanced perspective on the scientific foundations and societal implications of nuclear fission.
