Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes.  Historically, the understanding of fission emerged in the late 1930s, following the discovery of neutron-induced nuclear reactions.  Scientists, notably Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, observed unexpected barium isotopes after bombarding uranium with neutrons – a phenomenon subsequently interpreted by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch as nuclear fission: the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei.

This process releases a tremendous amount of energy, explained by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²).  The fission of uranium-235, for example, produces lighter fission fragments, along with additional neutrons. These neutrons, in turn, can trigger further fission events in a chain reaction, forming the basis of nuclear reactors and weapons. The specific fission fragments produced vary, leading to a complex energy release spectrum.  Understanding the intricacies of these chain reactions, including neutron moderation and control, is crucial for both harnessing the energy of fission and preventing uncontrolled reactions.  We shall explore these aspects further in subsequent lectures.
