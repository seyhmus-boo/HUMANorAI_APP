Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, is fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The process initiates when a neutron, governed by wave-particle duality, interacts with the target nucleus.  This interaction, probabilistic in nature, overcomes the strong nuclear force binding the nucleons, but only if the neutron possesses sufficient energy and interacts with the correct quantum states within the nucleus.  The wave function of the nucleus deforms, leading to a configuration where the Coulomb repulsion between protons overcomes the strong force, initiating the fission process.

This deformation isn't a smooth classical process; rather, it proceeds via quantum tunneling through potential energy barriers.  The probability of tunneling is governed by the energy of the system and the width of the barrier, dictated by the nuclear potential.  The resulting fragments are not predictable with complete certainty, illustrating the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics; the decay products exhibit a distribution of energies and masses governed by quantum mechanical probability amplitudes.  Thus, understanding fission requires a sophisticated quantum mechanical treatment of the nuclear many-body problem.
