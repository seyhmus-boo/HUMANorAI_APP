CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in genome editing.  However, despite its transformative potential, several experimental challenges remain that hinder widespread application and limit the scope of achievable modifications. This presentation will address key obstacles encountered in CRISPR-mediated gene editing.  We will explore the limitations of target specificity, highlighting off-target effects and the challenges in predicting and mitigating unwanted edits. Furthermore, we will discuss the complexities associated with delivering CRISPR components to target cells, particularly in vivo,  and the varied efficacy observed across different cell types and organisms.  The presentation will also examine the challenges of achieving efficient large-scale genomic rearrangements and the difficulties in precisely controlling the extent and nature of gene editing, including the challenges of repairing double-strand breaks. Finally, we will briefly touch upon the ethical considerations inherent in the widespread adoption of CRISPR technology, emphasizing the importance of robust experimental validation and careful risk assessment.  The discussion will conclude by outlining potential avenues for future research aimed at overcoming these experimental limitations and enhancing the safety and efficacy of CRISPR-based gene editing.
