Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, traditionally relies on general relativity. However, the singularity at the black hole's heart necessitates a quantum mechanical description to fully understand the process. This presentation explores the interplay between general relativity and quantum mechanics in black hole formation, focusing on key unresolved issues.  We will examine the limitations of classical gravitational collapse in describing the final stages of stellar evolution, highlighting the emergence of quantum effects near the Planck scale.  Specific topics include the role of Hawking radiation in information loss paradoxes and the potential contribution of quantum gravity theories, such as loop quantum gravity and string theory, in resolving the singularity problem.  We will discuss how these approaches attempt to replace the classical singularity with a more physically plausible quantum structure, potentially influencing the black hole's mass and entropy.  Further, we will address the implications of quantum fluctuations in the early universe on the formation of primordial black holes. Finally, we will briefly discuss avenues for future research, emphasizing the need for a consistent and complete quantum theory of gravity to achieve a definitive understanding of black hole genesis.
