Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation surpasses classical physics, exhibiting stronger-than-classical correlations even at macroscopic distances.  The entangled particles' properties, such as spin or polarization, are intrinsically intertwined; measuring a property of one instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the other, seemingly violating the principle of locality.

This interdisciplinary phenomenon bridges physics, particularly quantum information science, with other fields.  In computer science, entangled particles form the basis for quantum computing, offering exponentially faster computation for specific problems.  Cryptography leverages entanglement for secure quantum key distribution, ensuring unbreakable encryption.  Furthermore, biology explores potential applications in quantum biology, investigating whether entanglement plays a role in biological processes like photosynthesis or avian magnetoreception.  Philosophical implications also arise, challenging our understanding of realism and locality, prompting debates on the nature of reality and measurement.  Therefore, understanding entanglement is crucial for advancements across various scientific and technological domains.
