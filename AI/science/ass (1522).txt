Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have garnered significant attention across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines due to their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.  Their unique structure, characterized by spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, gives rise to a remarkable combination of high strength-to-weight ratio, exceptional electrical conductivity (both metallic and semiconducting depending on chirality), and remarkable thermal conductivity. This paper explores the fundamental properties of CNTs, focusing on recent advancements in understanding and manipulating these characteristics.  Recent breakthroughs include the development of scalable and cost-effective synthesis methods, yielding higher purity and better controlled chirality distributions, crucial for realizing their full potential in applications.  Significant progress has also been made in characterizing and manipulating their electronic properties, enabling the creation of novel nanoelectronic devices. Moreover, research into the functionalization and modification of CNT surfaces has expanded their applicability in diverse areas, such as composite materials, energy storage, and biosensors. This review aims to synthesize current knowledge on CNT properties, highlighting key challenges and opportunities for future research and development.
