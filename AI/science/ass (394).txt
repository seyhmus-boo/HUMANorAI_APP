Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, exhibit a unique combination of exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have garnered significant scientific and technological interest.  Their exceptional strength-to-weight ratio, surpassing that of steel by orders of magnitude, coupled with remarkable flexibility and high tensile strength, positions them as ideal candidates for advanced composite materials.  Furthermore, CNTs can display either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality and diameter, offering versatility for electronic applications.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, while their large surface area promotes excellent adsorption capabilities.  These remarkable properties translate to a diverse range of potential applications.  This research paper explores the fundamental properties of CNTs, focusing on their structural characteristics, mechanical behaviour, electrical conductivity, and thermal properties. We will discuss the influence of factors such as chirality, diameter, and defects on these properties, and subsequently analyze their implications for practical applications in areas including aerospace engineering, electronics, energy storage, and biomedical engineering, ultimately aiming to provide a comprehensive overview of the current understanding of CNT properties and their future prospects.
