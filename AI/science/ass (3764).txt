Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with unique cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties rendering them promising candidates for diverse applications.  This review summarizes key characteristics crucial to their technological potential.  CNTs demonstrate remarkable mechanical strength, possessing tensile strengths significantly exceeding that of steel, coupled with high elasticity.  Their electrical properties are equally noteworthy, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on chirality, enabling applications in electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  Their large surface area-to-volume ratio contributes to exceptional adsorption capabilities, useful in catalysis and environmental remediation.  However, challenges remain, including efficient, scalable production methods, effective dispersion in composite materials, and the potential toxicity associated with certain CNT types and handling processes.  Future research should focus on addressing these limitations to fully unlock the potential of CNTs across a broad range of technological sectors.
