Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in the lifecycle of sufficiently massive stars.  Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel within their cores, these stars undergo gravitational collapse, exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit and ultimately overcoming the degeneracy pressure of electrons. This runaway process leads to the formation of a singularity, a point of infinite density at the center of the black hole.  The surrounding spacetime is warped to such an extent that even light cannot escape its gravitational pull, defining the event horizon, the boundary beyond which no information can be transmitted to an outside observer.  Stellar-mass black holes typically form via this mechanism, whereas supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, are believed to arise through accretion of matter and potentially the merging of smaller black holes.  The theoretical understanding of black hole formation is crucial in various astrophysical contexts, including modeling galactic evolution and gravitational wave emission.  Practically, the study of black hole X-ray binaries facilitates the refinement of general relativity, while observations of gravitational waves originating from black hole mergers provide valuable insights into the strong-field regime of gravity and the expansion rate of the universe.  Furthermore, understanding black hole accretion processes is critical for modeling the energy output of active galactic nuclei and for interpreting high-energy astrophysical phenomena.
