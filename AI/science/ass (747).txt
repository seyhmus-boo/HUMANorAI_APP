Catalysts are indispensable in organic chemistry, significantly accelerating reaction rates and enabling transformations otherwise unattainable under practical conditions.  Their role hinges on providing alternative reaction pathways with lower activation energies, achieved through the formation of transient catalyst-substrate complexes. This lecture surveys the diverse applications of catalysts in organic synthesis, focusing on their mechanistic underpinnings.  We will explore homogeneous catalysis, exemplified by transition metal complexes mediating cross-coupling reactions and asymmetric hydrogenations, highlighting the crucial role of ligand design in controlling selectivity.  Heterogeneous catalysis, utilizing solid-supported catalysts such as zeolites and metal nanoparticles, will be discussed, emphasizing their advantages in terms of catalyst recovery and reusability.  Finally, the lecture will address emerging areas such as biocatalysis, employing enzymes as highly selective and environmentally benign catalysts, and photocatalysis, harnessing light energy to drive challenging organic transformations. Understanding catalytic principles is paramount for developing sustainable and efficient synthetic methodologies.
