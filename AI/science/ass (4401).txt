DNA replication, the process by which genetic material is duplicated, is a fundamental biological process crucial for cellular proliferation and inheritance.  This review summarizes the key features of this intricate mechanism, highlighting its remarkable fidelity and efficiency.  The process involves unwinding of the double helix by helicases, stabilization of single-stranded DNA by binding proteins, and the action of DNA polymerases in synthesizing new strands in a 5' to 3' direction.  The leading and lagging strand synthesis, with the latter involving Okazaki fragments and ligase activity, are discussed.  The role of primase in providing RNA primers for polymerase initiation is also emphasized.  Furthermore, the inherent proofreading mechanisms of DNA polymerases, including 3' to 5' exonuclease activity, contribute to the remarkably low error rate of replication.  Finally, the review touches upon the complex interplay of proteins involved in replication fork progression and the challenges posed by replication of repetitive sequences and telomeres.  While significant advancements have been made, ongoing research continues to unravel the intricacies and regulation of this vital process, furthering our understanding of genome stability and its implications for various biological phenomena.
