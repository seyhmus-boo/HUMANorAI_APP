Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked regardless of spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics despite significant experimental hurdles.  While theoretical understanding is relatively robust, realizing and manipulating entangled states in practice presents numerous challenges.  These challenges broadly fall into categories of generation, preservation, and measurement.  Generating highly entangled states with high fidelity remains a significant obstacle, particularly for larger numbers of particles.  Environmental decoherence, arising from interactions with the surrounding environment, rapidly destroys entanglement, demanding meticulous control over experimental conditions and the development of sophisticated isolation techniques.  Furthermore, accurately measuring entangled states without disrupting the delicate quantum correlations presents a considerable technical limitation.  Developing efficient and robust measurement protocols, such as those employing advanced detectors and quantum tomography, is crucial for advancing the field.  Overcoming these experimental difficulties is paramount for realizing the potential applications of entanglement in quantum computing, communication, and sensing technologies.  Ongoing research actively addresses these challenges, with promising progress in areas like trapped ions and superconducting circuits.
