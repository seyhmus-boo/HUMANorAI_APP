Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for diverse technological applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  This presentation will address key difficulties encountered during the synthesis, characterization, and manipulation of CNTs.  Specifically, we will discuss the challenges associated with controlling CNT chirality and diameter during synthesis, leading to heterogeneous samples with varying properties.  The accurate determination of structural parameters, including chirality and defect density, using techniques like Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, remains a significant hurdle due to the nanoscale dimensions and inherent complexities of CNT structures.  Further complicating matters is the tendency of CNTs to aggregate, hindering their dispersion in solvents and hindering the processing necessary for device fabrication.  We will also briefly address challenges in achieving reliable and scalable functionalization strategies to tailor CNT properties for specific applications.  Finally, we will highlight recent advances aiming to mitigate these experimental challenges and pave the way for the widespread adoption of CNTs in advanced technologies.
