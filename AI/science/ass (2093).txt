Nuclear fission, the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, accompanied by the release of a significant amount of energy, remains a cornerstone of modern physics and technology. This paper delves into the intricacies of nuclear fission processes, examining both the underlying nuclear physics principles and the diverse practical applications that have arisen from this powerful phenomenon.  We will explore the different mechanisms driving fission, focusing on the role of neutron interactions and the resulting chain reactions.  A key focus will be on the factors influencing fissionability, including the critical mass concept and the impact of neutron moderation and control.  Beyond the theoretical framework, the paper will investigate the practical implications of fission, primarily in the context of energy generation through nuclear power plants.  The benefits and drawbacks of nuclear power will be critically evaluated, considering its contribution to baseload electricity supply alongside the associated challenges related to nuclear waste management and the potential risks of accidents. Finally, we will briefly touch upon other significant applications of nuclear fission, such as the production of medical isotopes for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and the role it plays in various scientific research fields.
