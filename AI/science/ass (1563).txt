DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning life, remains a subject of intense research.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of the core mechanisms of DNA replication, emphasizing the intricate interplay between enzymes like DNA polymerases, helicases, and primases.  We will then focus on recent advancements in our understanding of this process.  Specifically, we will discuss the emerging roles of accessory proteins in regulating replication fork progression and stability, particularly in the context of challenging genomic landscapes such as repetitive sequences and difficult-to-replicate regions.  Recent cryo-EM studies have provided unprecedented structural insights into these protein complexes, revealing dynamic interactions and allosteric regulation previously unseen.  Furthermore, progress in understanding the interplay between DNA replication and other cellular processes, including transcription and DNA repair, will be highlighted.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the implications of these recent findings for our understanding of genome instability, cancer development, and the development of novel therapeutic strategies targeting replication machinery.
