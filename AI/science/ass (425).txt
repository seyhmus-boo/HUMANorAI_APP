Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, relies on two principal mechanisms: light-dependent reactions and light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  Light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts.  Here, photosystems II and I, containing chlorophyll and accessory pigments, absorb photons, exciting electrons to higher energy levels.  This electron flow drives proton pumping across the thylakoid membrane, generating a proton gradient that fuels ATP synthesis via chemiosmosis.  Simultaneously, NADP+ is reduced to NADPH using electrons from photosystem I.  

The light-independent reactions, occurring in the chloroplast stroma, utilize the ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions to fix atmospheric CO2.  The Calvin cycle incorporates CO2 into RuBP via Rubisco, forming 3-PGA.  Through a series of enzymatic reactions, 3-PGA is reduced to G3P, a precursor to glucose and other carbohydrates.  Regulation of photosynthesis involves intricate feedback mechanisms controlling enzyme activity and stomatal conductance in response to environmental factors such as light intensity, temperature, and CO2 concentration.  Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for optimizing crop productivity and addressing climate change.
