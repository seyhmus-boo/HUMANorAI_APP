Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a subject of intense investigation despite decades of research.  The classical picture, involving the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, while providing a foundational understanding, continues to be refined by increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations and observational data.  Recent advancements in gravitational wave astronomy, notably through the detection of binary black hole mergers by LIGO and Virgo, have provided unprecedented insights into the final stages of stellar evolution and the properties of black holes formed through this mechanism.  These observations, coupled with improved theoretical models incorporating magnetic fields and rotation, are challenging our understanding of the mass-metallicity relationship and the diversity of black hole progenitors.  Furthermore, the burgeoning field of multi-messenger astronomy, integrating gravitational wave signals with electromagnetic counterparts, promises to further illuminate the complex processes leading to black hole formation. This paper will review the established theoretical frameworks for stellar-mass black hole formation, discuss recent observational breakthroughs and their implications, and highlight outstanding questions concerning the diverse pathways to these enigmatic objects, focusing particularly on the impact of recent advancements in high-resolution simulations and multi-messenger astrophysics.
