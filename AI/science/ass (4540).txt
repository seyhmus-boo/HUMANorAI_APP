Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the pivotal role of catalysts in organic chemistry.  Catalysts, by definition, accelerate reaction rates without being consumed themselves, enabling transformations otherwise kinetically prohibitive.  Their impact spans synthesis, particularly in achieving higher yields, selectivity, and atom economy. Traditionally, homogeneous catalysts, such as transition metal complexes, dominated the field.  However, recent developments emphasize heterogeneous catalysis, offering advantages in catalyst recovery and recyclability.  

Significant advancements include the rise of single-site heterogeneous catalysts, mimicking the precision of homogeneous systems while maintaining ease of separation.  Furthermore, the burgeoning field of photocatalysis utilizes light to activate catalysts, opening avenues for environmentally benign and sustainable processes.  Finally, the application of computational chemistry allows for predictive catalyst design, significantly accelerating the discovery of novel and highly efficient catalytic systems.  These advancements are transforming organic synthesis, paving the way for more efficient and sustainable chemical processes.
