CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient method for genome editing. This presentation will explore the mechanisms underlying CRISPR-Cas functionality, focusing on the guided RNA-mediated targeting of specific DNA sequences and the subsequent cleavage and repair processes.  We will discuss the diverse applications of CRISPR technology, including gene knockout, knock-in, and base editing, highlighting its impact across various fields.  Specific examples will include advancements in disease modeling, gene therapy development, and agricultural biotechnology.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the ethical considerations and challenges associated with CRISPR technology, such as off-target effects, potential for unintended consequences, and the accessibility and equitable distribution of this powerful tool.  Finally, we will briefly review emerging CRISPR-based technologies, including prime editing and base editors, which offer enhanced precision and versatility. The presentation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of CRISPR's current capabilities and future potential while acknowledging the crucial ethical considerations that must guide its responsible development and application.
