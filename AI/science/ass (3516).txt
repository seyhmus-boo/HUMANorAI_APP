Black hole formation remains a central area of astrophysical research, with significant recent advancements refining our understanding.  Stellar-mass black holes originate from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (â‰¥20 solar masses) at the end of their lifespan.  Detailed hydrodynamic simulations, incorporating improved equations of state and magnetic field effects, now offer more precise predictions of the progenitor star's properties and the resulting black hole's mass and spin.  These models increasingly account for the role of stellar rotation and mass loss through winds, explaining variations in observed black hole characteristics.

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs), residing at galactic centers, pose a more complex challenge. While direct collapse of massive gas clouds remains a viable scenario, particularly in early universe environments,  recent observations suggest that mergers of smaller black holes and accretion from surrounding gas are also crucial contributors to SMBH growth.  Gravitational wave observations, such as those from LIGO and Virgo, provide crucial data on merging stellar-mass black holes, offering insights into the population of these objects and indirectly contributing to our understanding of SMBH formation through hierarchical merging.  Further research focusing on high-redshift SMBH detection and improved theoretical modelling of early galactic environments is necessary to fully elucidate their formation pathways.
