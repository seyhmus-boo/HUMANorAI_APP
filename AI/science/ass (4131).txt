DNA replication, the semiconservative process of producing two identical DNA molecules from a single parental molecule, is fundamental to life.  The process unfolds through a coordinated interplay of enzymes, including helicase, which unwinds the double helix, and DNA polymerase, which synthesizes new strands using the parental strands as templates.  Leading and lagging strand synthesis, characterized by continuous and discontinuous replication respectively, ensures complete duplication.  Okazaki fragments, short DNA segments synthesized on the lagging strand, are subsequently joined by ligase.

Recent developments have refined our understanding of this intricate mechanism.  High-resolution structural studies, employing cryo-electron microscopy, have provided unprecedented detail on the dynamic interactions within the replisome, the complex of proteins involved in replication.  Furthermore, research into the roles of accessory proteins, beyond the core replisome components, has revealed their crucial functions in maintaining replication fidelity and managing replication stress.  Investigations into the mechanisms of DNA replication in extreme environments, such as those experienced by extremophiles, are uncovering novel adaptations and potentially inspiring the development of more robust biotechnological applications.  Advances in single-molecule techniques offer insights into the stochastic nature of replication and the dynamics of replication fork progression.
