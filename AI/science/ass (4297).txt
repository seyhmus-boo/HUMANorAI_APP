Experimental verification of quantum entanglement, while increasingly robust, remains challenging due to several significant factors.  The fragility of entangled states to environmental decoherence presents a major hurdle.  Even weak interactions with the surrounding environment, such as thermal fluctuations or stray electromagnetic fields, can rapidly destroy the delicate quantum correlations.  This necessitates meticulous experimental control over the system's isolation and temperature, often involving cryogenic environments and sophisticated shielding techniques.  Furthermore, achieving high fidelity entanglement generation and detection is crucial.  Imperfect sources or detectors introduce noise and errors, compromising the statistical significance of observed correlations and potentially mimicking classical correlations.  Characterizing and mitigating these imperfections requires precise calibration and advanced quantum state tomography techniques.  Finally, the scalability of entanglement experiments is a persistent problem.  Demonstrating entanglement between increasingly large numbers of particles is essential for applications in quantum computing and communication, yet the experimental complexity and resource demands escalate exponentially, posing significant technological obstacles to overcome.
