Black hole formation remains a complex and actively researched area in astrophysics.  This review summarizes the current understanding of this process, focusing on the two primary pathways: stellar-mass black hole formation through the core-collapse of massive stars and supermassive black hole formation via mechanisms yet to be definitively established.  Stellar collapse models, incorporating sophisticated numerical simulations of stellar evolution and general relativity, have advanced our understanding of the progenitor star characteristics and the ensuing explosion dynamics influencing black hole mass and spin.  However, uncertainties persist regarding the equation of state of dense matter and the role of magnetic fields.  Regarding supermassive black holes, several competing hypotheses exist, including direct collapse of massive gas clouds and the mergers of stellar-mass black holes.  These theories face challenges explaining the rapid growth of SMBHs observed in the early universe.  Future advancements hinge on improved theoretical models incorporating multi-messenger observations (gravitational waves, electromagnetic radiation, neutrinos) and enhanced observational capabilities, particularly in the high-redshift universe, to probe the early stages of black hole growth and elucidate the diverse pathways to black hole formation.
