DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding, predating Watson and Crick's 1953 model, hinted at a semi-conservative mechanism â€“ a concept experimentally confirmed by Meselson and Stahl's 1958 isotopic labelling experiment.  This demonstrated that each new DNA molecule consists of one parental strand and one newly synthesized daughter strand.

The process is initiated at specific sites called origins of replication, where the DNA double helix unwinds, creating replication forks.  Helicases catalyze unwinding, while single-strand binding proteins prevent reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for adding nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction.  Leading strand synthesis occurs continuously, while lagging strand synthesis is discontinuous, generating Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, resulting in two identical DNA molecules.  The remarkable accuracy of replication is ensured by proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases, minimizing errors and maintaining genomic integrity.  Errors that do occur are subject to further repair mechanisms.
