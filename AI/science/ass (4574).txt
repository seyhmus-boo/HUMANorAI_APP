Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the quantum mechanical underpinnings of nuclear fission.  Classically, we might view fission as a simple splitting of a nucleus.  However, a quantum perspective reveals a far richer picture.  The process initiates with quantum tunneling.  The strong nuclear force, while dominant at short ranges, exhibits a finite probability of penetration through the Coulomb barrier, even for energetically unfavourable configurations.  This tunneling allows for the formation of a highly deformed nuclear shape, a crucial intermediary state.

The wavefunction describing the nucleus in this state is crucial.  Its evolution, governed by the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation, dictates the probability of fission.  The complex interplay between the strong and electromagnetic forces, intrinsically quantum in nature, determines the potential energy surface governing the nuclear configuration.  The probability density of the wavefunction indicates the likelihood of different fission fragment combinations, influencing the final mass and energy distribution.  Understanding these quantum probabilities is paramount to accurate fission modelling and prediction, going beyond simple classical approximations.  Therefore, a quantum mechanical treatment is indispensable for a complete understanding of nuclear fission.
