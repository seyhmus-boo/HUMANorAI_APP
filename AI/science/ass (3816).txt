Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique sp²-hybridized structure.  Their mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel, arises from the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheets forming their walls, a concept bridging materials science and chemistry.  This strength, coupled with their high aspect ratio, makes them ideal for reinforcement in composite materials, impacting engineering applications.  Their electrical properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality (a concept from topology), are exploited in nanoelectronics, demonstrating the synergy between materials science and physics.  Furthermore, their high surface area facilitates applications in energy storage (e.g., batteries and supercapacitors) and catalysis, showcasing links to chemistry and chemical engineering.  Biocompatibility and functionalization possibilities, explored at the interface of materials science and biology, open avenues for drug delivery and biosensing.  Thus, CNTs’ properties represent a rich interdisciplinary field driving advancements across multiple scientific and engineering domains.
