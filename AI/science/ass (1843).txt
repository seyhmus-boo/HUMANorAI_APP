DNA replication, the fundamental process of cellular duplication, remains a subject of intense research.  The canonical model, while providing a robust framework, continues to be refined by recent advancements.  High-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled detailed analyses of replication timing and origin usage, revealing unexpected complexity and heterogeneity across the genome.  Studies leveraging single-molecule techniques have provided unprecedented insights into the dynamics of replication fork progression, revealing the impact of various factors, including nucleosome positioning and epigenetic modifications, on replication speed and fidelity.  Furthermore, research is expanding beyond the conventional focus on the eukaryotic replisome, exploring the mechanisms of replication in diverse organisms and organelles, including mitochondria and chloroplasts.  Advances in cryo-electron microscopy are yielding high-resolution structures of replication complexes, revealing conformational changes that drive the process.  While the fundamental principles are well-established, recent developments underscore the intricate regulation and inherent plasticity of DNA replication, offering a more nuanced understanding of this essential biological process and its implications for genome stability and evolution.
