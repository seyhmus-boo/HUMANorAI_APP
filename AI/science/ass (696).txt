Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon with profound implications across numerous scientific disciplines.  At its core, entanglement describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, irrespective of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation surpasses classical physics, exhibiting stronger-than-classical correlations even at macroscopic distances.

The implications are far-reaching. In quantum computing, entangled particles form the basis of powerful quantum algorithms, offering exponential speedups over classical approaches.  This has significant repercussions for materials science, enabling the design of novel materials with enhanced properties.  Furthermore, entanglement finds application in quantum cryptography, promising unconditionally secure communication channels.

Interdisciplinary links are crucial.  The foundations of entanglement lie in quantum mechanics, yet its experimental verification relies heavily on advances in experimental physics, particularly in laser technology and low-temperature physics.  Information theory provides the mathematical framework for understanding the information processing capabilities of entangled systems. Finally, the philosophical implications of non-local correlations challenge our understanding of reality, spurring discussion amongst physicists and philosophers alike.  The study of entanglement thus embodies the power of interdisciplinary collaboration in unlocking the secrets of the quantum world.
