The formation of black holes, while classically understood through gravitational collapse of massive stars, gains a richer perspective from quantum mechanics.  The process isn't simply a deterministic shrinking of spacetime; quantum fluctuations play a crucial, albeit poorly understood, role.  Initially, a sufficiently massive star, having exhausted its nuclear fuel, undergoes core collapse.  The ensuing gravitational pressure surpasses the degeneracy pressure of fermions, the Pauli exclusion principle unable to prevent further collapse.

Quantum field theory in curved spacetime suggests that near the event horizon, intense gravitational fields generate particle-antiparticle pairs via vacuum polarization.  This Hawking radiation, albeit minuscule for stellar-mass black holes, subtly alters the black hole's mass and entropy.  Furthermore, the nature of spacetime itself at the singularity, where classical physics breaks down, necessitates a quantum gravitational description, likely involving concepts like string theory or loop quantum gravity, which aim to unify general relativity with quantum mechanics.  However, a complete quantum theory of black hole formation remains an outstanding challenge.  The interplay between quantum effects and gravity near the singularity continues to fuel intense research.
