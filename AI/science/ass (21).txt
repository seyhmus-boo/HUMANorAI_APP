Chemical bonding and molecular structure represent a cornerstone of chemistry, explaining the macroscopic properties of matter based on its microscopic composition.  Early understandings, rooted in Dalton's atomic theory (early 19th century), lacked a comprehensive explanation for the forces holding atoms together.  Kossel and Lewis, in the early 20th century, independently proposed valence theories emphasizing the role of electrons in bonding, with Lewis structures illustrating shared electron pairs (covalent bonds) and electron transfer (ionic bonds).

Subsequent developments, including advancements in quantum mechanics, provided a more rigorous framework.  The valence bond theory (VBT) describes covalent bonds as the overlap of atomic orbitals, while molecular orbital theory (MOT) portrays bonding as the combination of atomic orbitals into delocalized molecular orbitals.  These theories allow for predictions of molecular geometry, employing concepts like hybridization (VBT) and symmetry (MOT),  crucial for understanding reactivity and physical properties.  Furthermore, intermolecular forces, such as van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, significantly impact bulk properties, adding another layer of complexity to the relationship between bonding and structure.  The ongoing development and refinement of computational methods continues to deepen our understanding of intricate molecular systems and their behaviours.
