Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges inherent in studying DNA replication.  While the semi-conservative model is now well-established, its elucidation presented significant hurdles.  Early experiments, like those employing density gradient centrifugation by Meselson and Stahl, required meticulous control of isotopic labelling and precise interpretation of banding patterns to differentiate between conservative, semi-conservative, and dispersive replication.  Furthermore, studying the in vivo process presented technical complexities.  Visualising the replication fork in real-time proved difficult, requiring the development of sophisticated microscopy techniques and fluorescently labelled nucleotides.  Additionally, isolating and purifying the multitude of proteins involved—helicases, polymerases, primases, ligases—and reconstituting their intricate interactions in vitro posed considerable challenges, necessitating the development of novel biochemical purification methods and in vitro replication systems.  Overcoming these challenges ultimately provided crucial insights into the complex mechanisms underpinning this fundamental biological process.
