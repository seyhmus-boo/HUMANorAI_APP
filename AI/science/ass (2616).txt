Good morning. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission, the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy. This energy release stems from the mass defect, a difference in mass between the original nucleus and its fission products, converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  The process is typically initiated by bombarding a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with a neutron. This neutron absorption causes the nucleus to become unstable, leading to its fission.  Crucially, this fission also releases further neutrons, capable of initiating a chain reaction, a self-sustaining sequence of fissions.

The controlled chain reaction is the basis for nuclear power generation.  Within a reactor, control rods regulate the reaction rate, preventing uncontrolled escalation. The heat generated through fission boils water, producing steam which drives turbines and generates electricity.  Conversely, an uncontrolled chain reaction forms the basis of nuclear weapons, where the rapid release of energy causes a devastating explosion.  While nuclear fission presents significant risks, its potential to provide large-scale energy remains a significant factor in global power production.
