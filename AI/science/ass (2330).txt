This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on recent advancements and ongoing research.  We will begin by reviewing the fundamental principles governing nuclear fission, including chain reactions and criticality.  Particular attention will be given to the interplay between neutron cross-sections and fissile material properties, highlighting their influence on reactor design and operation.

Recent developments in the field will be a central theme.  The abstract will examine progress in advanced reactor designs, such as Generation IV reactors, emphasizing their potential to improve safety, efficiency, and waste management.  Discussions will include the exploration of Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) and their ability to transmute long-lived radioactive waste.  Furthermore, we will address the ongoing research into novel fuel cycles and the utilization of minor actinides to enhance sustainability.

The presentation will conclude with a brief discussion of the challenges and opportunities facing the nuclear fission sector, including the need for public acceptance and the imperative to develop robust strategies for spent fuel management.  This overview will provide attendees with an updated understanding of the current state of nuclear fission research and its potential to contribute to future energy demands.
