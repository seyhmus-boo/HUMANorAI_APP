DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating a DNA molecule, is fundamental to life.  Early experiments by Meselson and Stahl (1958) using density gradient centrifugation definitively demonstrated its semiconservative nature, disproving conservative and dispersive models.  The process begins at origins of replication, where helicase unwinds the double helix, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins prevent reannealing, while topoisomerases relieve torsional stress.

Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate synthesis. This enzyme adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, forming Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the gaps between Okazaki fragments, resulting in two identical DNA molecules, each composed of one original and one newly synthesized strand.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases.  The intricate coordination of these enzymes ensures accurate and efficient DNA duplication, crucial for cellular proliferation and genetic inheritance.
