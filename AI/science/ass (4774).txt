CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient method for genome editing.  This technology leverages the bacterial CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune system, utilizing guide RNA (gRNA) to direct the Cas nuclease to a specific DNA target sequence.  Cas enzymes then create double-stranded breaks, stimulating cellular repair mechanisms â€“ non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), often resulting in insertions or deletions (indels), or homology-directed repair (HDR), enabling precise gene replacement.

Recent developments have significantly expanded CRISPR's capabilities. Base editors, fusing Cas nucleases with deaminases, allow for precise single-base changes without double-stranded breaks, minimizing off-target effects.  Prime editors, combining reverse transcriptase with a nickase Cas enzyme, offer even greater editing flexibility, enabling insertions, deletions, and all twelve possible base-to-base conversions.  Furthermore, advancements in delivery methods, such as adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) and lipid nanoparticles, improve the efficacy of CRISPR-mediated gene editing *in vivo*. These ongoing developments are accelerating the translation of CRISPR technology into therapeutic applications, including gene therapy for inherited diseases and cancer immunotherapy.
