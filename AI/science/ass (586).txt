Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, necessitates a multidisciplinary approach to fully understand its diverse manifestations. This presentation will explore the multifaceted pathways to black hole genesis, highlighting the interplay between theoretical physics, observational astronomy, and computational astrophysics.  We will examine the stellar-mass black hole formation pathway stemming from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, emphasizing the critical role of stellar evolution models and the limitations imposed by current observational techniques in confirming theoretical predictions.  Further, we will address the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), exploring competing theories, including direct collapse models and the hierarchical merger scenario, and their implications for galaxy formation and evolution. The presentation will also touch upon the interdisciplinary connections with numerical relativity, crucial for simulating the complex dynamics of gravitational collapse and merger events, and the essential role of gravitational wave astronomy in providing direct observational evidence of these processes.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the open questions and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field, including the exploration of intermediate-mass black holes and their formation mechanisms.
