Black hole formation is a consequence of gravitational collapse within astrophysical environments.  Massive stars, exceeding approximately three times the solar mass, exhaust their nuclear fuel, ceasing the outward pressure that counteracts gravity.  The core then implodes under its own weight, exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit.  If the resulting core mass surpasses the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, even neutron degeneracy pressure fails to prevent further collapse, leading to the formation of a singularity – a point of infinite density – shrouded by an event horizon.  This event horizon defines the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape, thus creating a black hole.

Beyond stellar-mass black holes, supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, likely form through a combination of mechanisms including the accretion of surrounding gas and dust, mergers of smaller black holes, and perhaps direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe.

Practical applications of this understanding are limited, but it significantly advances our comprehension of gravity at extreme scales, testing and refining General Relativity. Studying black hole mergers through gravitational wave astronomy provides insights into the evolution of galaxies and the expansion of the universe.  Moreover, theoretical investigations into black holes contribute to fundamental physics research, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of spacetime and quantum gravity.
