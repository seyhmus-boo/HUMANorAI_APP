DNA replication, the semiconservative process of creating two identical DNA molecules from one, is fundamental to life.  Initiated at specific origins of replication, the process involves unwinding the double helix by helicases, stabilized by single-stranded binding proteins.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, which adds nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction, leading to the continuous synthesis of the leading strand and the discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand in Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, resulting in two complete DNA molecules.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and mismatch repair mechanisms.  Errors, however, can lead to mutations, driving evolution but also contributing to diseases.  Understanding DNA replication has numerous practical applications, including PCR (polymerase chain reaction) for DNA amplification in forensic science and diagnostics, gene cloning for biotechnology and pharmaceuticals, and the development of novel anti-cancer drugs targeting replication enzymes.  Furthermore, research into replication mechanisms is crucial for understanding ageing and age-related diseases.
