Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, remains incompletely understood at the quantum level.  Classical general relativity predicts the formation of a singularity within an event horizon, a region from which even light cannot escape.  However, this classical description breaks down at the Planck scale, necessitating a quantum theory of gravity to fully resolve the process.  Several approaches attempt to address this, including loop quantum gravity and string theory, which predict modifications to spacetime near the singularity, potentially preventing its formation or replacing it with a more regular structure.  These quantum effects are hypothesized to play a crucial role during the final stages of stellar collapse, potentially influencing the nature of the event horizon and the information paradox.  Investigations into Hawking radiation and its implications for black hole evaporation are central to this endeavor.  A deeper understanding requires further progress in quantizing gravity and developing experimentally testable predictions concerning the behavior of spacetime at extreme densities and curvatures, potentially observable through gravitational wave detection or high-energy particle interactions near black holes.  Ultimately, a complete quantum picture of black hole formation is vital for a coherent understanding of spacetime itself.
