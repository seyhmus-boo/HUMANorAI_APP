Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems wherein the individual states of the entangled particles are undefined until measured.  This interconnectedness transcends classical physics, exhibiting non-local correlations that violate Bell's inequalities.  Upon measurement of one entangled particle's state, the state of the other particle is instantaneously determined, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This does not imply faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of the measurement on the first particle is inherently random.  The entangled system exists in a superposition of states until measurement collapses the wavefunction, simultaneously defining the states of all entangled particles.  The implications of entanglement are profound, with applications currently explored in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation, promising revolutionary advancements in information processing and communication technologies.  Further investigation into the fundamental nature of entanglement remains a crucial area of ongoing research.
