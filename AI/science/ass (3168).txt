Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, is a process underpinned by the strong and weak nuclear forces, resulting in the release of substantial energy.  This energy liberation stems from the mass defect, governed by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.  Induced fission, primarily utilized in nuclear reactors, is typically initiated by thermal neutron absorption in fissile isotopes such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239.  Neutron absorption leads to an unstable nucleus, subsequently undergoing fission into smaller daughter nuclei, releasing further neutrons and significant kinetic energy.  The released neutrons initiate a chain reaction, the controlled rate of which is crucial for reactor operation.  Control is achieved through neutron moderators and absorbers.  Spontaneous fission, albeit less prevalent, occurs naturally in certain isotopes and contributes to background radiation levels.  Fission products exhibit high radioactivity, necessitating robust containment and waste management strategies.  The precise fission products and their yields are influenced by the fissile isotope and the incident neutron energy, a factor impacting reactor design and spent fuel characteristics.  Further research focuses on improved fuel efficiency, advanced reactor designs, and sustainable solutions for nuclear waste disposal.
