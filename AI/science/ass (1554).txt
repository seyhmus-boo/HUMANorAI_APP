Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the mechanisms of photosynthesis, a process fundamental to life on Earth.  Early understanding, dating back to the 17th century with van Helmont's willow tree experiment, incorrectly attributed plant growth solely to water uptake.  However, Priestley's and Ingenhousz's later work established the crucial roles of light and air, specifically identifying oxygen production.

The overall process can be summarized in two distinct stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (or Calvin cycle).  The former utilizes chlorophyll and other pigments within thylakoid membranes to capture light energy, converting it to chemical energy in the form of ATP and NADPH.  Water is split during this stage, releasing oxygen as a byproduct.  The light-independent reactions, occurring in the stroma, utilize this ATP and NADPH to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide into glucose via a series of enzymatic reactions.  This glucose serves as the building block for plant biomass and energy storage.  Variations in these processes exist across different plant types, reflecting evolutionary adaptations to diverse environmental conditions.  We will delve into the specifics of each stage in subsequent lectures.
