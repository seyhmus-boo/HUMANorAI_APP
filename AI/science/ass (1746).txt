Good morning. Today's lecture concerns chemical bonding and its influence on molecular structure.  Early attempts to understand bonding, such as Dalton's atomic theory, focused on simple combining ratios.  However, the true nature of bonding remained elusive until the advent of quantum mechanics.  This revolutionary theory, in the early 20th century, provided the framework for understanding the electrostatic interactions that dictate bond formation.

We now recognize two primary types: ionic bonding, resulting from the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions formed by electron transfer; and covalent bonding, where atoms share electrons to achieve stable electron configurations, often described by Lewis structures.  The number of valence electrons dictates the bonding capacity of an atom, leading to variations in molecular geometry.  VSEPR theory, accounting for electron pair repulsion, successfully predicts molecular shapes such as linear, tetrahedral, and trigonal bipyramidal structures.  Understanding bonding and structure is paramount, as these dictate a molecule's physical and chemical properties, impacting everything from reactivity to biological function.  We will explore these concepts further in subsequent lectures.
