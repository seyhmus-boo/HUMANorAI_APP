Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of electrons in the constituent atoms, specifically their wavefunctions.  According to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the relatively slow-moving nuclei are considered stationary while the electrons' wavefunctions are determined.  The lowest-energy solution to the time-independent Schrödinger equation for the molecular system represents the stable ground state.  Bonding occurs when the total energy of the molecule is lower than the sum of the energies of the individual atoms, a consequence of electron delocalization and the lowering of overall electron energy.

Molecular structure, including bond lengths and angles, emerges from the minimization of the molecular energy. This energy is expressed as a function of the nuclear coordinates, providing a potential energy surface whose minima correspond to stable molecular geometries.  The nature of the bonding – covalent (electron sharing), ionic (electron transfer), or metallic (delocalized electrons) – dictates the spatial arrangement of atoms and the resultant molecular shape, often reflected in the symmetry of the molecular orbitals.  Advanced computational methods, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), exploit these principles to predict molecular structures and properties with increasing accuracy.
