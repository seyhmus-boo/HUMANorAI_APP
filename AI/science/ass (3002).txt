Nuclear fission processes represent the disintegration of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, accompanied by the release of a significant quantity of energy.  This energy release stems from the mass defect inherent in the strong nuclear force, where the total mass of the resultant nuclei is less than the initial parent nucleus.  The process is typically initiated by the absorption of a neutron, inducing instability within the nucleus.  Subsequent fission events are often characterized by the emission of additional neutrons, fostering a chain reaction crucial for sustained nuclear fission, such as in nuclear reactors.  The specific fission products generated vary depending on the fissile isotope, with a range of radioactive elements produced.  This radioactivity necessitates robust safety protocols and waste management strategies.  While uranium-235 and plutonium-239 are common fissile isotopes exploited in practical applications, other isotopes, albeit with varying fission cross-sections and energy yields, can also undergo fission.  The control and manipulation of the chain reaction, through neutron moderation and absorption, are paramount in achieving both controlled energy production and preventing uncontrolled exponential growth.
