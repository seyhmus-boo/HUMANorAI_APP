Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This non-classical correlation, violating Bell's inequalities, has profound implications for quantum computing, cryptography, and our fundamental understanding of reality.  However, realizing the full potential of entangled systems faces significant experimental challenges. This paper focuses on these hurdles, examining the limitations imposed by current technology in the creation, manipulation, and measurement of entangled states.  Specifically, we will explore the difficulties associated with maintaining coherence, minimizing decoherence rates due to environmental interaction, and achieving high fidelity entanglement generation across various platforms, including superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and photonic systems.  Furthermore, we will discuss the scalability issues inherent in extending these techniques to larger entangled systems necessary for practical applications.  Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing the field and unlocking the transformative possibilities offered by entangled quantum systems.
