Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, is a process best understood through analogy.  Imagine a meticulously balanced stack of dominoes: a uranium-235 nucleus represents this precarious structure.  Introducing a single neutron (a nudge) initiates a chain reaction, akin to toppling the first domino.  This neutron's impact causes the nucleus to fission, releasing a significant amount of energy – like the collective potential energy of the entire domino stack suddenly converting to kinetic energy.  Furthermore, the fission process itself yields more neutrons, acting as subsequent dominoes, triggering further fissions in a cascading effect.  This uncontrolled chain reaction is analogous to a runaway domino effect, characteristic of nuclear weapons.  However, in controlled fission reactors, this chain reaction is carefully moderated, using control rods (like strategically placed obstacles) to absorb excess neutrons, maintaining a sustainable, manageable release of energy – a carefully orchestrated domino cascade.  The released energy, primarily in the form of heat, is then harnessed to generate electricity, highlighting the dual nature of fission: a powerful force capable of both immense destruction and constructive energy generation.  Understanding the precise mechanisms governing this nuclear domino effect is paramount for harnessing its potential safely and effectively.
