Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have captivated the scientific community for their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, promising revolutionary advancements across diverse fields.  Their unique structure, characterized by seamlessly bonded spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices, bestows them with remarkable strength-to-weight ratios, surpassing those of steel, and exceptional electrical conductivity comparable to copper.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit high thermal conductivity, making them attractive for thermal management applications.  Recent research has focused on mitigating challenges associated with CNT synthesis, including the control of chirality and diameter distribution, crucial for optimizing desired properties.  Advances in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) techniques have enabled the growth of highly aligned and purified CNT arrays, enhancing their processability and performance in composites.  Moreover, significant progress has been made in functionalizing CNTs, tailoring their surface chemistry to improve dispersibility in various matrices and enable targeted interactions. This paper will review the fundamental properties of CNTs, highlighting recent developments in synthesis, characterization, and functionalization, and will discuss their implications for emerging applications in areas such as electronics, energy storage, and advanced materials.
