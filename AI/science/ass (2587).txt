Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.  Their unique structure, characterized by seamlessly bonded spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms forming a hexagonal lattice, underpins their remarkable characteristics.  This paper explores the diverse properties of CNTs, focusing on recent advancements in understanding and manipulating these properties for diverse applications.  Early research primarily focused on characterizing the intrinsic properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), establishing their exceptionally high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity (depending on chirality), and superior thermal conductivity.

Recent developments have concentrated on overcoming challenges associated with CNT processing and large-scale production.  Significant progress has been made in techniques for controlled synthesis, including the development of catalyst optimization strategies for achieving higher yield and purity. Furthermore, research has extensively explored functionalization methods to tailor the surface chemistry of CNTs, enabling improved dispersibility and integration into composite materials.  This review will analyze these key advances, alongside discussions of emerging applications in fields ranging from advanced composites and energy storage to biomedical devices and sensors.
