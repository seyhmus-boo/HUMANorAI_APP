Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, remains a topic of active research, despite significant advancements in our understanding.  The classical picture, involving the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, is well-established,  but nuances continue to emerge. Recent simulations with improved resolution reveal the complex interplay of stellar rotation, magnetic fields, and convective processes during core collapse, significantly affecting the final black hole mass and spin.  Furthermore, the detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes by LIGO and Virgo has revolutionized our knowledge of binary black hole populations, prompting new models incorporating dynamical interactions in dense stellar environments.  Studies of active galactic nuclei (AGN) are also providing crucial insights, with high-resolution observations challenging previous models of accretion disk structure and jet formation.  While the general principles are understood, a complete theoretical framework encompassing all stages of black hole formation, from stellar evolution to the growth of supermassive black holes, remains elusive. Continued progress hinges on increasingly sophisticated numerical simulations, enhanced gravitational wave detection capabilities, and improved observations across the electromagnetic spectrum.
