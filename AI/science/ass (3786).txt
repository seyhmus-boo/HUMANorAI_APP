Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon of quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, irrespective of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, exhibiting non-local correlations that violate Bell's inequalities.  Entanglement arises from the superposition principle, where the composite system exists in a superposition of entangled states, rather than a probabilistic mixture of separable states.  Upon measurement of one entangled particle, the state of the other instantaneously collapses into a corresponding state, regardless of the distance separating them.  This non-local behavior, while seemingly paradoxical, is not exploitable for faster-than-light communication due to the inherent randomness of the measurement outcomes.  The study of entanglement is crucial for advancing quantum technologies, with applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  Ongoing research focuses on improving the generation and manipulation of entangled states, achieving higher fidelity and scalability, and exploring fundamental implications for our understanding of quantum mechanics and reality.
