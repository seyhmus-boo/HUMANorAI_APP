Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, driving extensive research into their applications across diverse fields. This presentation will overview the key properties of CNTs, categorizing them into single-walled (SWCNTs) and multi-walled (MWCNTs) variants, and highlighting the intrinsic differences stemming from their structural variations.  We will discuss their exceptional tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, and their remarkable electrical conductivity, tunable from metallic to semiconducting behavior depending on chirality.  Furthermore, their high thermal conductivity and large surface area will be examined.

Recent advancements in controlled synthesis techniques, such as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and plasma enhanced CVD, have enabled precise control over CNT diameter, length, and chirality, leading to improved material homogeneity and enhanced property predictability.  The presentation will also touch upon the latest developments in functionalization strategies to tailor CNT properties for specific applications, including covalent and non-covalent modifications to improve dispersibility and compatibility with various matrices.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the ongoing challenges related to scalability, cost-effective production, and toxicity concerns associated with CNT handling and disposal, outlining avenues for future research and development.
