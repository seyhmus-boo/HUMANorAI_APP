Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, have garnered significant attention for diverse applications.  Their unique structure, comprised of seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets, yields remarkable tensile strength exceeding that of steel, coupled with high flexibility and a tunable band gap depending on chirality and diameter. Recent advancements focus on precise control over CNT synthesis, enabling the production of highly homogenous samples with specific structural characteristics.  This includes the development of advanced catalytic methods for controlled diameter and chirality selection, as well as the exploration of bottom-up approaches for defect-free CNT growth.  Furthermore, research explores novel functionalization strategies to enhance CNT dispersibility and tailor their surface chemistry for specific applications.  Significant progress has been made in understanding CNT-based composites, revealing synergistic effects enhancing mechanical and electrical properties. Ongoing research into the long-term biocompatibility and toxicity of CNTs is crucial for advancing their use in biomedical applications such as drug delivery and biosensors.  These advancements pave the way for the widespread implementation of CNTs in high-performance materials, electronics, and energy storage devices.
