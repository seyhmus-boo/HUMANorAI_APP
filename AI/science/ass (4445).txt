Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  The process, first observed experimentally in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, following theoretical predictions by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, revolutionized our understanding of nuclear structure and unleashed immense energy.  This groundbreaking work demonstrated that the bombardment of uranium-235 with neutrons could induce fission, releasing a significant quantity of energy alongside further neutrons.  Crucially, the release of additional neutrons facilitates a chain reaction, a self-sustaining process where each fission event triggers subsequent fissions, leading to a rapid release of energy â€“ a principle exploited in nuclear power generation and weaponry.  The initial discovery sparked intense scientific interest, culminating in the Manhattan Project during World War II, which ultimately demonstrated the destructive potential of uncontrolled chain reactions.  Subsequent research broadened our understanding of different fissile isotopes and the complexities of neutron moderation and control, crucial for the safe and efficient operation of nuclear reactors.
