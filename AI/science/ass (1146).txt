Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them promising materials for diverse applications.  This presentation will overview the key properties of CNTs, including their remarkable tensile strength, high Young's modulus, and unique electrical conductivity, which can be tuned from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality.  The inherent nanoscale dimensions contribute to a high surface area, facilitating their use as catalysts and adsorbents.  We will discuss the influence of structural parameters like diameter and chirality on these properties and explore the challenges associated with their large-scale production and processing.  Furthermore, the presentation will highlight practical applications driven by these advantageous characteristics. Examples include their use in advanced composites for lightweight and high-strength materials,  nanoelectronics for next-generation transistors and sensors, energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors, and biomedical applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering.  Finally, future research directions and potential limitations will be briefly addressed.
