Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, represents a pivotal process with significant practical implications.  This review summarizes the core mechanisms, focusing on the induced fission of uranium-235 and plutonium-239, triggered by neutron bombardment.  The process releases a substantial quantity of energy, owing to the mass defect between the reactants and products, along with further neutrons, thus enabling chain reactions.  Control over these chain reactions is crucial, achieved through moderators and control rods in nuclear reactors.

The practical applications of fission are predominantly in energy production. Nuclear power plants utilize controlled fission to generate electricity, offering a high-energy density alternative to fossil fuels.  However, this application necessitates robust safety protocols and effective waste management strategies to address the long-term challenges posed by radioactive byproducts.  Beyond energy, fission finds application in nuclear medicine, providing radioisotopes for diagnostic imaging and therapeutic treatments.  Moreover,  it plays a role in  scientific research, particularly in neutron scattering experiments. Despite the benefits, the inherent risks associated with nuclear proliferation and potential accidents remain critical considerations in evaluating the overall impact of fission processes.
