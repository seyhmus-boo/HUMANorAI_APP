Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, constitutes a pivotal process with significant interdisciplinary ramifications.  Primarily a physics phenomenon, its understanding necessitates quantum mechanics to describe the strong and weak nuclear forces governing nuclear stability and decay.  The probabilities of fission events and the energy released are calculated using nuclear models, bridging physics with chemistry through the consideration of isotopic abundances and resulting elemental compositions.

Engineering plays a crucial role in reactor design, encompassing materials science (e.g., selection of radiation-resistant materials) and thermodynamics (e.g., managing heat transfer and coolant properties).  Furthermore, the geopolitical landscape is profoundly shaped by fission's dual use potential:  energy generation versus weapons proliferation. This necessitates the involvement of political science and international relations in establishing safety protocols and non-proliferation treaties.  Finally, the environmental impact of nuclear fission, including waste disposal and potential for accidents, necessitates the expertise of environmental science and geoscience for long-term risk assessment and mitigation strategies.  Thus, understanding nuclear fission requires an integrated interdisciplinary approach.
