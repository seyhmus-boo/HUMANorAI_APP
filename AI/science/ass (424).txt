DNA replication, the process of duplicating a DNA molecule, is essential for cellular proliferation and inheritance.  This highly regulated process ensures faithful transmission of genetic information.  Initiation involves the unwinding of the double helix at origins of replication by helicases, aided by single-stranded binding proteins to prevent reannealing.  DNA polymerases, the key enzymes, synthesize new strands in a 5' to 3' direction, utilizing the parental strands as templates.  Leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously, while lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers to provide a 3'-OH group for polymerase initiation.  DNA ligase then joins these fragments.  Proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases minimize errors, maintaining genomic integrity.  Telomerase activity addresses the replication problem at chromosome ends, ensuring complete duplication.  The coordinated action of numerous proteins ensures efficient and accurate duplication of the genome, a fundamental process underpinning life's continuity.
