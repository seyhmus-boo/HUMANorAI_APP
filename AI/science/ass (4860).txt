DNA replication is the fundamental process by which a cell duplicates its DNA before cell division, ensuring genetic continuity.  It proceeds semi-conservatively, meaning each new DNA molecule consists of one original (parental) strand and one newly synthesized strand.  The process initiates at specific origin sites where helicase unwinds the double helix, creating a replication fork.  Single-strand binding proteins prevent re-annealing while topoisomerase relieves torsional stress.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a starting point for DNA polymerase, which adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, utilizing the parental strand as a template.  Leading strand synthesis is continuous, while lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously in Okazaki fragments, requiring repeated priming and ligation.  Finally, proofreading mechanisms minimize errors.

The accurate understanding of DNA replication has profound practical applications.  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology, crucial for diagnostic testing and forensic science, mimics this process in vitro to amplify specific DNA sequences.  Furthermore, knowledge of replication mechanisms informs cancer research, as errors in replication contribute to genomic instability and tumorigenesis.  Understanding replication fidelity is also critical in developing novel gene editing technologies and for manipulating genetic material in biotechnology.
