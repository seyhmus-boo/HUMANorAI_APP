This presentation addresses the experimental challenges inherent in the accurate determination and interpretation of chemical bonding and molecular structure.  While theoretical advancements in computational chemistry provide powerful predictive tools, experimental validation remains crucial for refining models and understanding complex systems. We will highlight key experimental limitations, focusing on the trade-offs between resolution and accessibility across various techniques.  Diffraction methods, such as X-ray and neutron diffraction, provide high-resolution structural data, but often require crystalline samples, limiting their applicability to amorphous or gas-phase species.  Spectroscopic techniques, including NMR, IR, and Raman spectroscopy, offer valuable insights into bonding and molecular dynamics, but their interpretation can be ambiguous, necessitating sophisticated computational analysis.  Furthermore, the challenges of studying transient species, reactive intermediates, and molecules under extreme conditions (high pressure, low temperature) will be discussed.  We will conclude by examining emerging experimental approaches, such as advanced microscopy and synchrotron-based techniques, which are pushing the boundaries of structural determination and enabling the study of increasingly complex systems with enhanced resolution and sensitivity.  The ultimate goal is to emphasize the ongoing need for innovative experimental methodologies to unravel the intricate details of chemical bonding and molecular architecture.
