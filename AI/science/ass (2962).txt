Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the fundamental principles of chemical bonding and molecular structure.  Early attempts to understand chemical interactions, predating sophisticated instrumentation, relied heavily on observations of stoichiometry and reactivity.  Daltonâ€™s atomic theory provided a crucial framework, suggesting atoms combined in simple whole-number ratios.  However, the nature of these interactions remained elusive until the advent of quantum mechanics.

Our modern understanding rests on the concept of valence electrons and their involvement in forming chemical bonds.  These bonds, broadly categorized as ionic (electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions), covalent (shared electron pairs), and metallic (delocalized electrons), dictate a molecule's geometry and its resultant properties.  The valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory, for instance, allows us to predict molecular shapes based on minimizing electron-electron repulsion.  Understanding these bonding principles is crucial for predicting reactivity, physical properties, and ultimately, for designing and synthesizing novel molecules with desired characteristics.
