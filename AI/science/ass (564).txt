Black hole formation, a pivotal prediction of Einstein's General Relativity, remains a topic of significant astrophysical investigation hampered by inherent observational challenges.  Directly observing the collapse of a stellar core into a black hole is currently impossible due to the extreme densities and gravitational effects obscuring the event.  Instead, researchers rely on indirect evidence, primarily gravitational wave detections from binary black hole mergers and electromagnetic emissions from active galactic nuclei (AGN), which infer black hole presence rather than directly witnessing their formation.  These indirect methods suffer from limitations.  Gravitational wave signals provide limited information on progenitor systems and the specifics of the collapse.  AGN observations are complex, confounded by intervening matter and relativistic effects that obscure the central black hole's formation process.  Furthermore, modelling the pre-collapse stellar evolution and the subsequent collapse itself is computationally expensive and reliant on incomplete equations of state for matter under extreme conditions.  Future improvements require advancements in gravitational wave detectors with increased sensitivity and broader frequency bands, coupled with multi-wavelength observations of stellar death events to better constrain theoretical models and ultimately unravel the mysteries surrounding black hole formation.
