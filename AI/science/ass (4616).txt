Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, a fundamental process central to life's continuity.  Early understanding of heredity predated knowledge of DNA's structure, with Mendel's work laying the groundwork.  However, the elucidation of the double helix by Watson and Crick in 1953 revolutionized the field.  Their model, immediately suggesting a mechanism for replication, posited a semi-conservative model where each strand serves as a template for a new, complementary strand.

This semi-conservative mechanism has since been experimentally verified.  The process begins with the unwinding of the double helix by enzymes like helicases, creating a replication fork.  DNA polymerase then synthesizes new strands, adding nucleotides complementary to the template strands in a 5' to 3' direction.  Leading and lagging strands are formed due to the antiparallel nature of DNA, with the lagging strand synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  Finally, ligase joins these fragments, completing the replication process.  This intricate choreography ensures faithful duplication of the genome, critical for cellular division and inheritance.
