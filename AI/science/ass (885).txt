Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise across diverse technological sectors.  However, the realization of their full potential is significantly hampered by persistent experimental challenges related to their synthesis, purification, and characterization.  This paper focuses on the multifaceted experimental difficulties encountered in the investigation of CNT properties.  The inherent variability in CNT structure, encompassing diameter, chirality, and degree of structural defects, complicates the accurate measurement and prediction of material properties.  Furthermore, the strong tendency of CNTs to agglomerate due to van der Waals forces presents a significant obstacle to the creation of well-dispersed samples essential for reliable experimentation.  Challenges also extend to the accurate characterization of CNT properties, with techniques like Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy often yielding ambiguous or inconsistent results due to sample heterogeneity and complexity.  Addressing these experimental limitations is critical for achieving a comprehensive understanding of CNT properties and facilitating their widespread technological adoption.  This review will analyze prevalent experimental challenges, highlighting recent advancements in synthesis, purification, and characterization techniques aimed at overcoming these obstacles.
