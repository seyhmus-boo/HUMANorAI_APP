Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter fragments, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the interplay of the strong nuclear force, binding nucleons together, and the Coulomb repulsion between protons.  In heavy nuclei, the Coulomb repulsion becomes increasingly dominant, overcoming the short-range strong force.  This destabilizing effect is amplified by quantum tunneling.  

The potential energy landscape of the nucleus exhibits a barrier separating the initial state (the parent nucleus) from the fission fragments.  Classical mechanics would predict that fission is impossible unless sufficient energy is provided to overcome this barrier. However, quantum mechanics allows for the probability of the nucleus tunneling through this barrier, even at energies below the barrier height.  This tunneling probability is exponentially dependent on the barrier's height and width, explaining the observed variation in fission rates across different nuclides.  Once the nucleus tunnels past the barrier, it rapidly separates into fragments, releasing a substantial amount of energy, primarily due to the decrease in Coulomb repulsion and the mass defect. The resulting fragments are often in excited states and subsequently decay via gamma emission and beta decay, further demonstrating the quantum nature of the process.
