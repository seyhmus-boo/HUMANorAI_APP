Chemical bonding and molecular structure constitute a cornerstone of modern chemistry, explaining the diverse properties of matter.  Early attempts to understand bonding, such as the valence theory proposed by Kekul√© and Couper in the mid-19th century, focused on the combining capacity of atoms.  However, these lacked the quantum mechanical basis needed for a complete explanation.  The advent of quantum mechanics in the early 20th century revolutionized the field, providing the theoretical framework for understanding electron sharing (covalent bonds) and electron transfer (ionic bonds) via molecular orbital theory and valence bond theory.

Molecular orbital (MO) theory, building on the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO), describes bonding through delocalized molecular orbitals encompassing the entire molecule, effectively explaining phenomena like resonance and aromaticity. Valence bond (VB) theory, conversely, focuses on localized bonds formed by the overlap of atomic orbitals, providing a more intuitive, albeit sometimes less accurate, description of molecular geometry.  Both theories, alongside advancements in computational chemistry, allow for the prediction and analysis of molecular geometries, bond lengths, bond angles, and dipole moments, directly correlating structure with reactivity and macroscopic properties.  The ongoing development of increasingly sophisticated computational methods continues to refine our understanding of this fundamental aspect of chemical science.
