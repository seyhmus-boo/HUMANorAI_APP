Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission through a quantum mechanical lens.  Unlike classical mechanics, which cannot explain the stability of nuclei, quantum mechanics provides the essential framework.  The strong nuclear force, governed by the exchange of gluons, binds nucleons within the nucleus.  However, this force is short-ranged, and electrostatic repulsion between protons significantly destabilizes larger nuclei.  

Fission occurs when the quantum tunneling probability of a nucleus overcoming the potential energy barrier surpasses a critical threshold. This barrier, a consequence of the interplay between the strong and electromagnetic forces, depends on the nuclear shape and is quantized.  Neutron absorption elevates the nuclear energy levels, increasing the probability of tunneling and causing deformation, leading to a fissioning nucleus.  The subsequent decay into daughter nuclei is governed by the wavefunction collapse, resulting in a probabilistic distribution of fission products and the release of kinetic energy, largely attributable to the Coulombic repulsion between the fragments.  Thus, a seemingly macroscopic process like fission finds its root in the fundamental probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics.
