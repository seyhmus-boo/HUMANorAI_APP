Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Its theoretical underpinnings were laid in the 1930s by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, following experimental observations by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann.  These scientists demonstrated that bombarding uranium with neutrons resulted in the fission of its nucleus, releasing a significant amount of energy and additional neutrons. This latter point is crucial, as these secondary neutrons can trigger further fission events, leading to a chain reaction.

The process is driven by the strong nuclear force, which binds protons and neutrons together.  However, in heavy nuclei, the electrostatic repulsion between protons becomes significant, overcoming the strong force at longer distances.  The addition of a neutron destabilizes the nucleus, causing it to fission into smaller, more stable nuclei.  The resulting mass defect, the difference between the initial and final masses, is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  This substantial energy release forms the basis for nuclear power generation and nuclear weapons, highlighting both the immense potential and inherent dangers of fission processes.
