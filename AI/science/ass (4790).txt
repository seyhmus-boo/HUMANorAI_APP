Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional material properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure.  This lecture will explore key characteristics contributing to their diverse applications.  Their exceptionally high aspect ratio results in remarkable mechanical strength and stiffness, surpassing that of steel.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate remarkable electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on chirality, a crucial structural parameter influencing their electronic properties.  Thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  Finally, the large surface area-to-volume ratio of CNTs affords significant potential for applications in catalysis, energy storage, and sensing.  However, challenges remain in achieving controlled synthesis, large-scale production, and effective dispersion in composite materials, limiting the full exploitation of their potential. This lecture will survey these properties and associated challenges, focusing on recent advancements in their understanding and practical applications.
