Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized structure.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, exceeding that of steel at a fraction of the weight, stems from the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheets composing their walls. This strength finds application in materials science, enhancing the tensile strength of composites for aerospace and automotive industries.  Their electrical properties are highly dependent on chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour, making them crucial components in nanoelectronics and sensor technology.  This tunability is exploited in interdisciplinary fields like biomedicine, where CNTs act as drug delivery vehicles, their conductivity facilitating targeted release.  Further, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, beneficial for thermal management applications in electronics and potentially in advanced energy storage devices.  The chemical inertness of CNTs, however, can limit their functionalization, a challenge addressed by surface modification techniques bridging chemistry and materials science.  Finally, their exceptional surface area contributes to their potential in catalysis and environmental remediation, highlighting their interdisciplinary impact across diverse scientific domains.
