Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, the fundamental process ensuring genetic continuity across generations.  Imagine DNA as a meticulously written instruction manual, a double-stranded helix composed of complementary base pairs.  Replication is akin to creating a perfect copy of this manual.

The process begins with the enzyme helicase, which acts like a zipper, unwinding the double helix to expose the individual strands. Each strand then serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.  This is achieved by DNA polymerase, an enzyme functioning like a precise scribe, adding nucleotides according to base-pairing rules â€“ adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine.

Think of this as using one half of a torn photograph to reconstruct the complete image. The original strands remain intact, acting as templates, and two identical daughter molecules are produced, each containing one original and one newly synthesized strand. This semi-conservative nature ensures faithful transmission of genetic information, vital for cellular function and organismal inheritance.  Any errors in this copying process can lead to mutations, a topic we'll explore in our next lecture.
