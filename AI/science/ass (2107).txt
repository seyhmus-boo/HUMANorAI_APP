DNA replication, while a seemingly straightforward process of duplicating the genome, presents significant experimental challenges.  Accurate measurement of replication rates in vivo, for example, is hampered by the inherent complexity of the cellular environment.  Techniques like pulse-chase experiments using radioactively labelled nucleotides offer insights, but suffer from limitations in temporal resolution and potential artifacts from the labelling itself.  Furthermore, the dynamic nature of replication forks, involving multiple proteins interacting simultaneously, makes their detailed study difficult.  Visualizing these intricate processes in real-time requires sophisticated microscopy techniques, often with limitations in resolution or requiring specialized cell lines amenable to live-cell imaging.  Investigating the fidelity of replication, crucial to maintaining genomic integrity, demands sensitive assays capable of detecting rare replication errors, often requiring the analysis of vast quantities of genomic data to identify subtle variations.  Finally, studying replication in organisms with unusual genomes, such as those with high GC content or unusual DNA structures, requires further adaptation and refinement of existing techniques, posing additional methodological hurdles.  Overcoming these challenges remains a crucial focus for ongoing research in molecular biology.
