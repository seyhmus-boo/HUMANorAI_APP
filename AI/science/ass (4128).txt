Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized structure and high aspect ratio.  This review summarizes key properties relevant to diverse applications.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, with Young's modulus exceeding that of steel, and high tensile strength, renders them ideal for reinforcement in composite materials.  Remarkable electrical conductivity, tunable between metallic and semiconducting behaviour depending on chirality, positions CNTs as promising components in nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT growth and achieving uniform dispersion in composites.  Their aspect ratio contributes to high surface area, leading to superior adsorption capabilities, useful in environmental remediation and energy storage.  Toxicity concerns, related to the potential for cellular damage, necessitate further investigation into biocompatibility and surface functionalization strategies for safe integration into biological systems.  Future research should focus on scalable synthesis methods and tailored functionalization to fully exploit the remarkable potential of CNTs across various technological domains.
