DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding, rooted in Chargaff's rules and the Watson-Crick model of DNA structure (1953), posited a semiconservative mechanism. Meselson and Stahl's elegant experiment (1958) definitively confirmed this, demonstrating that each new DNA molecule retains one parental strand.  The process involves a complex interplay of enzymes, initiated at specific origins of replication.  Helicases unwind the double helix, while single-strand binding proteins stabilize the separated strands.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a starting point for DNA polymerase, the key enzyme responsible for adding nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction.  Leading strand synthesis is continuous, whereas lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  DNA ligase joins these fragments, creating a complete daughter strand.  Telomerase addresses the end-replication problem at chromosome termini.  Errors during replication are corrected by proofreading and mismatch repair mechanisms, maintaining genome integrity.  Further research continues to elucidate the intricate regulation and fidelity of this crucial cellular process, with implications for understanding ageing, disease, and genome evolution.
