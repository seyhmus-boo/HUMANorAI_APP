Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy.  This process can be analogized to a carefully balanced stack of dominoes: the initial nucleus, akin to a meticulously arranged stack, is destabilized – perhaps by impacting it with a neutron, represented by a carefully placed extra domino. This triggers a chain reaction, where the falling dominoes (fission fragments) strike others, causing a cascading effect.  The energy released in the process mirrors the kinetic energy of the falling dominoes.

Unlike a simple domino effect, however, fission involves the conversion of a small amount of mass into a tremendous amount of energy, as described by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².  This mass-energy conversion can be visualized as the total mass of the final, smaller nuclei being slightly less than the original nucleus's mass – the "missing" mass is transformed into the released energy.  Furthermore, the process isn't perfectly predictable; the resulting fission fragments are not always identical, akin to dominoes falling at slightly different angles and speeds, resulting in a statistical distribution of products.  Careful control of the chain reaction, through moderators and control rods, analogous to carefully designed barriers and dampeners in the domino system, is crucial for harnessing the energy efficiently and safely.
