Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes.  Imagine an atom's nucleus, specifically a large, unstable one like uranium-235, as a delicately balanced stack of blocks.  These blocks represent neutrons and protons.  If we introduce a single neutron – a carefully aimed nudge – into this precarious stack (think of it as a carefully chosen projectile), it triggers a chain reaction.  This neutron's impact destabilizes the entire structure, causing it to split into two smaller nuclei – our stack collapses into two smaller piles – releasing a substantial amount of energy in the process, analogous to the sudden release of potential energy in a collapsing structure.  Furthermore, this splitting also releases additional neutrons, acting as new projectiles, continuing the chain reaction, like dominoes falling sequentially.  This self-sustaining chain reaction is the fundamental principle behind nuclear fission reactors and atomic bombs. The precise control of this chain reaction is crucial, distinguishing peaceful energy generation from destructive weaponization.  In essence, nuclear fission is the controlled or uncontrolled demolition of unstable atomic nuclei.
