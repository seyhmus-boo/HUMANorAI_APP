Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a source of ongoing investigation.  This presentation will offer a concise overview of entanglement, tracing its historical development from Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen's seminal 1935 paper, which highlighted the paradoxical implications of "spooky action at a distance," to the experimental verification of Bell's inequalities in the latter half of the 20th century. We will discuss the fundamental principles underlying entanglement, focusing on the concept of superposition and the violation of classical locality.  Further, the presentation will briefly explore the diverse applications of entanglement in emerging quantum technologies, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  While significant progress has been made, challenges remain in scaling entanglement for practical applications, particularly in maintaining coherence over extended periods and distances.  This presentation aims to provide a foundational understanding of entanglement, highlighting its historical context and its crucial role in shaping the future of quantum information science.
