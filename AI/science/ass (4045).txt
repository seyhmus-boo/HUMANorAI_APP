Understanding chemical bonding and molecular structure is fundamental to chemistry, yet experimental determination presents significant challenges.  Accurately characterizing bond lengths and angles requires sophisticated techniques, often operating at the limits of instrumental precision. X-ray crystallography, while powerful, is limited to crystalline solids and struggles with disordered systems or those containing light atoms.  NMR spectroscopy provides valuable information on connectivity and molecular dynamics but suffers from limitations in resolving complex spectra, particularly for large molecules.  Electron diffraction, although suitable for gaseous samples, faces challenges in data interpretation due to scattering complexities.

Furthermore, computational modeling, while increasingly sophisticated, relies on approximations and empirical parameters, introducing inherent uncertainties.  Bridging the gap between theoretical predictions and experimental observations remains a significant hurdle, particularly for complex systems displaying dynamic behavior or weak intermolecular interactions.  The experimental investigation of transient species and reactive intermediates presents further challenges, requiring the development of specialized time-resolved techniques with high temporal and spatial resolution.  Overcoming these experimental limitations necessitates continued advancement in instrumentation and data analysis strategies.
