The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting such extreme gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape, remains a central problem in astrophysics.  While the theoretical framework of general relativity provides a robust description of black hole properties, the precise astrophysical mechanisms leading to their creation continue to be refined through observation and simulation. This paper reviews current understanding of black hole formation, focusing on recent advancements in our knowledge.  Traditionally, stellar-mass black holes were understood to arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars at the end of their life cycle.  However, recent gravitational wave detections by LIGO and Virgo have provided unprecedented data on binary black hole mergers, significantly improving our understanding of their formation pathways and population statistics.  Furthermore, advancements in numerical relativity have allowed for more accurate modelling of the collapse process, accounting for complex phenomena like magnetic fields and rotation.  This paper will explore these developments, examining the contributions of both observational astronomy and theoretical modelling to our evolving comprehension of black hole formation, including discussions on intermediate-mass black holes and the formation of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies,  areas where considerable uncertainty and ongoing investigation remain.
