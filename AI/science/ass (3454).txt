Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, driving significant interdisciplinary research. This presentation explores the unique characteristics of CNTs and their implications across diverse fields.  We will discuss their exceptional tensile strength and high Young's modulus, relevant to advanced materials science for applications in lightweight composites and high-performance fibers.  Their remarkable electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, makes them crucial for electronics and sensor development, impacting areas like nanoelectronics and biosensing.  Furthermore, CNTsâ€™ high thermal conductivity is exploited in thermal management applications, bridging the gap between materials science and energy engineering.  The presentation will highlight interdisciplinary collaborations necessary to overcome challenges such as CNT purification, dispersion, and scalable production.  We will also examine the biological interactions of CNTs, emphasizing the crucial links between materials science, toxicology, and biomedical engineering, acknowledging both the potential and the inherent risks associated with their widespread implementation. Finally, we will briefly address future research directions aimed at fully harnessing the potential of CNTs across various scientific and technological domains.
