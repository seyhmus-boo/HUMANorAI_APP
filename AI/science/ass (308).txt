Nuclear fission is a process where a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  This process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the nucleus to become unstable and undergo fission.  The released neutrons can then initiate further fission events in a chain reaction, leading to a self-sustaining nuclear reaction.  The energy released is a consequence of the mass defect, where the total mass of the fission products is slightly less than the mass of the original nucleus; this mass difference is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².

The controlled chain reaction underlying nuclear fission finds practical applications primarily in nuclear power generation.  Nuclear reactors utilize controlled fission to produce heat, which is then used to generate steam and drive turbines for electricity production.  Conversely, uncontrolled chain reactions form the basis of nuclear weapons, where the rapid release of energy results in a devastating explosion.  Furthermore, fission processes are utilized in medical applications, such as neutron activation analysis for elemental determination and in the production of radioisotopes for medical imaging and treatment.
