Nuclear fission, the splitting of atomic nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery with profound implications for energy production and warfare.  Its historical roots trace back to the late 1930s, with the pioneering work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, who, through experiments bombarding uranium with neutrons, observed the unexpected formation of lighter elements.  Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch subsequently provided the theoretical explanation, identifying the process as nuclear fission and revealing its immense energy release stemming from the mass defect.  This breakthrough swiftly catalyzed the Manhattan Project, culminating in the devastating use of atomic bombs during World War II.

Post-war, research shifted towards controlled fission for peaceful applications.  The development of nuclear reactors, based on sustained chain reactions, provided a new source of energy, albeit one accompanied by challenges related to radioactive waste management and the potential for accidents, exemplified by Chernobyl and Fukushima.  Contemporary research focuses on improving reactor safety, exploring alternative reactor designs like breeder reactors, and addressing the long-term disposal of nuclear waste.  Despite controversies, nuclear fission remains a significant contributor to global energy production, prompting ongoing debate about its role in a sustainable energy future.
