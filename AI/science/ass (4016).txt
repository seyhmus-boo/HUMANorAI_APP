Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, presents significant experimental challenges despite its established theoretical framework.  Precise control over the fission process, crucial for applications like nuclear reactors and weapons, requires overcoming hurdles in neutron physics.  Maintaining a critical mass, the minimum amount of fissile material necessary for a self-sustaining chain reaction, demands highly sophisticated control systems to prevent uncontrolled reactivity.  Furthermore, accurate measurement of fission yields and energy release necessitates precise instrumentation capable of handling intense radiation and high temperatures.  The short lifespan of many fission fragments complicates the study of their properties, demanding rapid detection methods and sophisticated data analysis techniques.  Experimental investigations into the intricacies of fission dynamics, such as the precise mechanism of neutron emission and the distribution of fission products, require sophisticated detector arrays and advanced computational modelling to interpret complex experimental data.  Finally, the inherent dangers associated with handling radioactive materials necessitate rigorous safety protocols and specialized facilities, adding complexity and cost to experimental research.
