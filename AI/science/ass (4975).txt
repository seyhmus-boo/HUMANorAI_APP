This presentation provides a concise overview of chemical bonding and molecular structure through the lens of quantum mechanics. We will explore how the fundamental principles of quantum theory underpin our understanding of molecular interactions and geometries.  The discussion will begin with a brief review of the Schr√∂dinger equation and its application to simple diatomic molecules, illustrating the formation of bonding and antibonding molecular orbitals through linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO).  Emphasis will be placed on the role of electron density in defining bond strength and length, highlighting the relationship between the wavefunction's spatial distribution and observable molecular properties. We will then extend this analysis to polyatomic molecules, introducing concepts like hybridization and valence bond theory to explain more complex molecular structures and bonding patterns.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the limitations of simplified models and introduce advanced computational methods used for accurate prediction of molecular structures and properties, emphasizing the ongoing evolution of quantum chemical approaches in this field.
