Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, transcends disciplinary boundaries, engaging diverse fields from theoretical physics to computational astrophysics and observational astronomy. This presentation explores the multifaceted pathways leading to black hole birth, emphasizing interdisciplinary connections crucial to our current understanding. We will review the canonical stellar-mass black hole formation via core-collapse supernovae, highlighting the complex interplay between stellar evolution, nuclear physics, and hydrodynamic simulations used to model these explosive events.  The challenges in accurately predicting the remnant mass and spin will be discussed, emphasizing the need for improved equations of state and neutrino transport modeling.

Furthermore, the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), residing at the centers of most galaxies, remains a significant puzzle.  We will explore competing theories, such as direct collapse scenarios and hierarchical mergers, emphasizing the astronomical observations – from active galactic nuclei feedback to gravitational wave detections – that provide crucial constraints.  The presentation concludes by outlining future interdisciplinary research directions, including the potential synergy between multi-messenger astronomy, advanced numerical simulations, and improved theoretical models of galaxy evolution, necessary to unlock the mysteries of black hole formation across the cosmological mass spectrum.
