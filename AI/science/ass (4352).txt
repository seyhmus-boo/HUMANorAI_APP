Chemical bonding and molecular structure find their rigorous foundation in quantum mechanics.  This abstract summarizes the key quantum mechanical principles governing these phenomena.  The fundamental description lies in the solution of the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for a multi-electron system, though this is analytically intractable for all but the simplest molecules.  Approximation methods, such as the Born-Oppenheimer approximation separating nuclear and electronic motion, and the Hartree-Fock method employing a single determinant wavefunction, provide practical computational tools.  Molecular orbital theory, arising from the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approach, successfully predicts bonding characteristics based on the constructive and destructive interference of atomic wavefunctions.  Bonding arises from the lowering of the total electronic energy through the delocalization of electrons, stabilized by coulombic attractions and exchange interactions.  Molecular geometry is dictated by the minimization of the total energy with respect to nuclear coordinates, reflected in the potential energy surface.  Advanced methods like density functional theory (DFT) offer computationally efficient alternatives, capturing electron correlation effects to refine predictions of bond lengths, bond angles, and vibrational frequencies, ultimately providing a detailed quantum-mechanical understanding of molecular structure and reactivity.
