Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This interconnectedness transcends classical intuition;  imagine two coins flipped simultaneously, but hidden from view.  In a classical scenario, each coin has a definite state (heads or tails) independent of the other.  However, in an entangled system, the coins are analogous to entangled particles.  Knowing the state of one coin instantly reveals the state of the other, even if they are light-years apart. This is not due to some unknown signal passing between them faster than light, but rather a fundamental interconnectedness reflecting their shared quantum state.  A more precise analogy might be two gloves from a single pair:  finding a right-handed glove instantly informs us that the other glove must be left-handed, irrespective of their distance. This instantaneous correlation, however, does not allow for faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of each measurement remains inherently probabilistic until observed.  The inherent non-locality of entanglement underscores the limitations of classical physics in describing the behavior of quantum systems.
