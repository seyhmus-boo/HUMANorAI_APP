Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into smaller nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Its historical genesis lies in the 1938 experiments of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, who, while aiming to create heavier elements through neutron bombardment of uranium, unexpectedly observed the formation of lighter elements like barium.  Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch subsequently interpreted this as nuclear fission, explaining the release of a tremendous amount of energy via Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.

This discovery rapidly transitioned from a fundamental scientific observation to a technological imperative.  The potential for weaponizing this energy, culminating in the Manhattan Project, overshadowed early explorations of its peaceful applications.  Fission processes are now understood to occur via different mechanisms, largely dictated by the incident neutron's energy.  Thermal neutron fission, utilized in most nuclear reactors, involves slow neutrons interacting with fissile isotopes like Uranium-235, resulting in a chain reaction sustained by the release of further neutrons.  This controlled chain reaction is fundamental to nuclear power generation, though the inherent challenges of radioactive waste management remain a significant concern.
