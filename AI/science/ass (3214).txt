Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, releasing vast amounts of energy.  This process, harnessed in nuclear power plants, relies primarily on the controlled chain reaction of uranium-235 or plutonium-239.  Neutron bombardment initiates fission, producing further neutrons to sustain the reaction.  

Recent developments centre around enhanced safety and waste management.  Advanced reactor designs, such as Generation IV reactors, aim to improve efficiency, reduce waste production, and enhance inherent safety features.  These incorporate passive safety systems, minimizing reliance on active intervention during emergencies.  Furthermore, research into transmutation – converting long-lived radioactive waste into shorter-lived isotopes – offers a potential solution to the persistent challenge of nuclear waste disposal.  While significant hurdles remain, these advancements represent substantial progress towards a more sustainable and secure nuclear energy future.  We will now delve into the specifics of Generation IV reactor designs...
