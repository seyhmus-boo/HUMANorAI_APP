Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional physicochemical properties that have garnered significant interest across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines.  This paper reviews the key properties of CNTs, focusing on their remarkable mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, and unique thermal characteristics.  The exceptional tensile strength and Young's modulus of CNTs, significantly exceeding those of steel, make them attractive for reinforcement in composite materials.  Furthermore, their electrical conductivity, which can be either metallic or semiconducting depending on chirality, presents opportunities for applications in nanoelectronics and energy storage.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation, making them suitable for thermal management applications.  This review will explore the relationship between CNT structure (including diameter, chirality, and defects) and these properties, highlighting the impact of various synthesis methods on the resultant material characteristics.  Finally, we will discuss the challenges associated with processing and manipulating CNTs for large-scale applications and potential future research directions aimed at realizing their full potential.
