Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating process of black hole formation.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  When a star exceeding approximately three times the mass of our Sun exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer counteract its own immense gravity. The core implodes, leading to a singularity – a point of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon, the point of no return.  More massive stars, exceeding twenty solar masses, may undergo even more dramatic collapses, potentially forming supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.

These processes, while seemingly esoteric, have practical applications.  The study of black hole formation informs our understanding of stellar evolution and galactic dynamics, crucial for cosmological models.  Furthermore, the intense gravitational fields near black holes offer unique testing grounds for Einstein's theory of General Relativity.  Finally,  investigations into the accretion disks surrounding black holes – where matter spirals inward – are improving our comprehension of high-energy astrophysical phenomena, with potential implications for future energy technologies, though currently highly speculative.  Thus, the seemingly abstract study of black holes has profound implications across astrophysics and beyond.
