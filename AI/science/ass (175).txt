Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, have garnered significant attention for diverse applications. This presentation will overview the key properties of CNTs, emphasizing recent advancements in understanding and manipulating these materials.  We will discuss the inherent relationship between CNT structure (chirality, diameter, and length) and their resultant properties, focusing on the dichotomy between metallic and semiconducting behavior.  Recent progress in controlled synthesis techniques, enabling precise control over CNT chirality and uniformity, will be highlighted, alongside their implications for device fabrication.  Furthermore, the presentation will address advancements in functionalization strategies, showcasing methods to enhance CNT solubility, dispersibility, and interaction with other materials, crucial for realizing their full potential in composites, sensors, and energy storage devices.  Finally, we will briefly explore ongoing challenges and future directions in CNT research, particularly concerning scalability, cost-effectiveness, and the long-term environmental impact of their production and disposal.
