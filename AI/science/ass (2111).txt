Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  Imagine a rolled-up sheet of graphene, a single layer of hexagonally bonded carbon atoms.  This seemingly simple structure gives rise to extraordinary characteristics.  First, their high aspect ratio – think of incredibly long, thin needles – grants them exceptional tensile strength, far exceeding that of steel.  Secondly, their unique electronic structure allows for variability in conductivity; some behave as metals, others as semiconductors, akin to tuning a dial on an electrical device. This tunability is crucial for applications in electronics.  Furthermore, their high surface area, like a densely packed sponge, allows for exceptional adsorption capabilities, useful in gas storage and catalysis.  Finally, their thermal conductivity rivals that of diamond, implying excellent heat dissipation, analogous to a highly efficient heat sink.  These remarkable properties, arising from their simple yet elegant structure, make CNTs a material of significant scientific and technological interest.  We shall now delve into specific applications…
