Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential across diverse technological applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  This presentation will focus on these challenges, specifically addressing the difficulties inherent in characterizing and manipulating CNTs.  The inherent heterogeneity in CNT samples, encompassing variations in diameter, chirality, and structural defects, presents a major obstacle to precise property measurement and consistent performance across devices.  Techniques like Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy, while providing valuable insights, are often insufficient for complete characterization.  Furthermore, effective purification and dispersion of CNTs in suitable matrices remain problematic, impacting the reproducibility and scalability of device fabrication.  The challenge of precisely controlling CNT alignment and placement within devices further complicates the achievement of desired functionalities. Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss ongoing efforts to overcome these experimental hurdles, highlighting the development of advanced characterization tools and novel processing techniques aimed at unlocking the full potential of CNTs.
