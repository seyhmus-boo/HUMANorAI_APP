Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a cornerstone of both energy production and scientific inquiry.  This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental mechanisms governing nuclear fission processes, focusing on the interplay between nuclear structure, reaction dynamics, and resulting fission fragment distributions.  We examine the crucial role of nuclear deformation and shell effects in determining fission probabilities and the characteristics of the emitted fragments, including their mass, charge, and kinetic energy.  Furthermore, the influence of incident particle energy and target nucleus properties on fission yield is analyzed, highlighting the complexities of multi-chance fission and the associated neutron emission.  The paper delves into both theoretical models employed to describe fission, such as the liquid drop model and its refinements incorporating shell effects, and experimental techniques used to characterize fission products.  Finally, we briefly discuss the ongoing research and challenges in the field, encompassing improved predictive models and their implications for applications ranging from nuclear reactor design to advanced nuclear fuel cycles and the potential for novel fission-based technologies.
