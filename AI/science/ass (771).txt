DNA replication, the fundamental process by which genetic information is duplicated, remains a central area of biological investigation.  While the semiconservative model, elucidated decades ago, provides the basic framework, recent advancements have significantly refined our understanding of this intricate process.  This paper will explore these contemporary developments, focusing particularly on the complexities beyond the simple Watson-Crick model.  Significant progress has been made in elucidating the roles of various accessory proteins, including those involved in replisome assembly and stability, highlighting a far more dynamic and regulated process than previously appreciated.  Furthermore, recent high-resolution structural studies have provided unprecedented detail on the mechanisms of DNA polymerase fidelity and processivity, shedding light on error correction pathways and their implications for genome stability.  The impact of chromatin structure on replication fork progression and the intricate interplay between replication and other cellular processes, such as transcription and repair, are also key areas of active research that will be addressed.  This review will synthesize current knowledge, highlighting the remaining challenges and promising avenues for future exploration in this vital field.
