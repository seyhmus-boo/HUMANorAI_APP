The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their unique quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp² hybridized carbon atoms form a seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheet, resulting in a cylindrical structure with remarkable strength and stiffness. This high tensile strength arises from the strong covalent σ bonds within the hexagonal lattice and the delocalized π electrons, whose behaviour is dictated by the Schrödinger equation for this specific geometry.  The electronic properties are profoundly influenced by the nanotube's chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's roll) and diameter, determining whether a CNT behaves as a metallic conductor or a semiconductor.  This behaviour is a consequence of the quantized energy levels of the π electrons, leading to specific band gaps that can be tuned by manipulating structural parameters.  Furthermore, the quantum confinement effect within the nanoscale diameter significantly influences the optical properties, resulting in unique absorption and emission spectra which are strongly dependent on diameter and chirality.  Thus, the macroscopic properties of CNTs are ultimately a manifestation of the underlying quantum mechanical phenomena governing electron behavior within their highly ordered nanostructure.
