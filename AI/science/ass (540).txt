Catalysts are indispensable in modern organic chemistry, enabling transformations otherwise inaccessible under conventional conditions.  However, their application is frequently hampered by significant experimental challenges. This presentation will explore key limitations encountered in the practical use of catalysts, focusing on three primary areas: catalyst heterogeneity and recovery, catalyst deactivation pathways, and the challenges associated with catalyst screening and optimization.  We will discuss the difficulties associated with separating homogeneous catalysts from reaction mixtures, particularly for complex target molecules, and the strategies employed to mitigate this, including supported catalysts and flow chemistry techniques.  Further, we will analyze common modes of catalyst deactivation, including poisoning, leaching, and decomposition, and highlight the analytical methods crucial for identifying these processes.  Finally, the presentation will address the combinatorial explosion inherent in catalyst screening and propose efficient approaches, such as high-throughput experimentation and machine learning techniques, to accelerate the discovery and optimization of novel catalytic systems.  Overall, this presentation aims to provide a critical overview of the experimental hurdles in catalyst-driven organic synthesis and potential avenues for future improvement.
