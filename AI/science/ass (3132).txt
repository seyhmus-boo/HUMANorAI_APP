Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, hinges on the concept of gravitational collapse.  Historically, the theoretical groundwork was laid by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century, who posited the existence of "dark stars" â€“ objects so massive that even light could not escape their gravity.  Einstein's theory of general relativity, however, provided the rigorous framework for understanding black hole formation.

The process typically begins with the death of a massive star (several times the mass of our Sun).  Once nuclear fusion ceases in the star's core, the outward pressure supporting it against its own gravity is lost.  The core then undergoes catastrophic implosion, compressing matter to an infinitely dense singularity.  Depending on the star's initial mass and its angular momentum, this collapse can result in either a stellar-mass black hole or, in the case of extremely massive stars, a supermassive black hole. The intense gravitational field surrounding the singularity then warps spacetime, creating the event horizon, the point of no return beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  The formation process can also occur through the merging of neutron stars or through direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe.
