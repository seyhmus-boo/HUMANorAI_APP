Nuclear fission is the process where a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and further neutrons.  This process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the nucleus to become unstable and undergo fission.  The released neutrons can then induce fission in other nuclei, leading to a chain reaction. The energy released manifests as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and as gamma radiation.  The magnitude of energy released is a consequence of the mass defect, governed by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).

The controlled chain reaction underpinning nuclear fission is harnessed in nuclear power plants to generate electricity.  The heat generated by fission is used to boil water, producing steam that drives turbines connected to generators.  Conversely, uncontrolled chain reactions characterize nuclear weapons, where the rapid release of energy results in a devastating explosion.  Beyond power generation and weaponry, fission also finds application in medical radioisotope production, used in diagnostic imaging and cancer therapy, demonstrating the multifaceted nature of this nuclear process.
