Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of electrons in the constituent atoms, specifically their wavefunctions.  According to the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, nuclei are considered stationary relative to rapidly moving electrons, allowing for the separation of nuclear and electronic motion.  The total electronic wavefunction of a molecule, a solution to the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation, describes the probability distribution of electrons within the molecule's potential energy field.

Stable molecular structures correspond to minima on the potential energy surface, representing energetically favourable configurations.  These minima are a consequence of attractive Coulombic interactions between nuclei and electrons, counterbalanced by electron-electron and nucleus-nucleus repulsions.  Molecular orbitals, formed through linear combinations of atomic orbitals, provide a convenient representation of the electron distribution within the molecule.  The spatial distribution of electron density, as dictated by these orbitals, determines the geometry and properties of the molecule, including bond lengths, bond angles, and dipole moments.  Different bonding theories, such as valence bond and molecular orbital theory, offer complementary approaches to understanding these complex interactions.
