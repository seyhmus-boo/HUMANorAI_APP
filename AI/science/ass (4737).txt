Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, exhibit a unique combination of properties stemming from their distinctive structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms rolled into seamless tubes.  These structures, existing as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), confer exceptional mechanical strength, with tensile strengths exceeding that of steel by several orders of magnitude.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to remarkable flexibility and resilience.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality (the angle of the carbon lattice roll-up), offering potential for advanced electronics applications.  Their thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, surpassing that of many materials, making them promising for thermal management systems.  Finally, their large surface area contributes to significant adsorption capabilities, relevant in areas such as gas storage and catalysis.  Understanding these diverse and exceptional properties is crucial for harnessing the potential of CNTs in a wide range of technological fields.
