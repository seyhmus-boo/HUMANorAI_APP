Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, is crucial for sustaining life on Earth.  This abstract summarizes key mechanisms underlying this process, focusing on oxygenic photosynthesis prevalent in plants, algae, and cyanobacteria.  Light harvesting occurs via pigment-protein complexes, primarily chlorophyll *a* and *b*, embedded within photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII).  Excitation of these pigments initiates a series of electron transfer reactions, driven by the light-dependent splitting of water molecules (photolysis) at PSII, releasing oxygen as a byproduct.  The electron transport chain, involving plastoquinone, cytochrome b6f complex, and plastocyanin, generates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, driving ATP synthesis via chemiosmosis.  Simultaneously, NADPH is produced via ferredoxin-NADP+ reductase.  The light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, utilize the ATP and NADPH generated to fix atmospheric CO2 into carbohydrates via the action of Rubisco.  Different photosynthetic pathways, such as C4 and CAM, have evolved to optimize CO2 fixation under various environmental conditions.  Ongoing research continues to elucidate the intricate details of these mechanisms, focusing on optimizing photosynthetic efficiency for enhanced crop yields and biofuel production.
