Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more particles wherein their fates are intertwined regardless of the spatial separation.  This interconnectedness transcends classical physics; measuring the property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the corresponding property of the other, even at distances exceeding light-years.  This non-local correlation arises from the particles sharing a common quantum state, such that they exist in a superposition of possibilities until measured.  The specific outcome of a measurement on one particle is then determined probabilistically, yet simultaneously defines the outcome of a measurement on its entangled partner, violating classical notions of locality and realism.  While the precise mechanism remains a subject of ongoing debate, the experimental verification of entanglement is robust.  Practical applications are burgeoning, notably in quantum computing, where entangled qubits form the basis of powerful algorithms surpassing classical computation.  Furthermore, entanglement underpins quantum cryptography, offering unconditionally secure communication channels by leveraging the inherent violation of Bell's inequalities.  Other prospective applications include quantum teleportation, enabling the transfer of quantum states between distant locations, and the development of highly sensitive quantum sensors.
