The understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure underpins much of modern chemistry and materials science.  From the earliest alchemists' attempts to transmute base metals into gold to the sophisticated computational modelling techniques of today, humanity's quest to unravel the forces governing atomic interactions has driven significant scientific advancements.  Early theories, such as the valence bond theory pioneered by Gilbert N. Lewis, provided a foundational framework explaining the sharing and transfer of electrons between atoms.  However, these initial models lacked the sophistication needed to fully explain the complexities of molecular geometry and reactivity. The subsequent development of molecular orbital theory, incorporating quantum mechanics, offered a more robust and accurate representation, accounting for delocalized electrons and resonance structures.  This paper explores the evolution of our understanding of chemical bonding from these historical foundations to contemporary applications. We examine the core principles of valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory, highlighting their strengths and limitations.  Furthermore, we analyze the crucial interplay between bonding, molecular geometry, and the resulting physical and chemical properties, using selected examples to illustrate these complex relationships.
