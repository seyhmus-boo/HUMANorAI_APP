Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with unique cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have spurred extensive research and development across diverse fields.  Their exceptional tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility, makes them attractive for advanced composite materials.  The electronic properties of CNTs are highly dependent on their chirality and diameter, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior.  Metallic CNTs demonstrate high electrical conductivity, surpassing that of copper, while semiconducting CNTs exhibit excellent field-effect transistor characteristics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional thermal conductivity, significantly higher than many conventional materials, enabling their application in thermal management systems.  However, challenges remain, including the control of CNT chirality and diameter during synthesis, as well as the efficient dispersion and functionalization of CNTs within composite matrices.  Ongoing research focuses on addressing these challenges to fully realize the vast potential of CNTs in various technological applications, including electronics, energy storage, and biomedical devices.
