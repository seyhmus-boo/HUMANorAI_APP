This presentation explores the fundamental concepts of chemical bonding and molecular structure, tracing their historical development and highlighting their contemporary significance.  Early attempts to understand chemical combination, exemplified by Dalton's atomic theory and the Law of Multiple Proportions, laid the groundwork for subsequent advancements.  The presentation will then delve into the evolution of bonding theories, commencing with the Lewis model and its depiction of covalent bonds through shared electron pairs.  The limitations of this simple model will be discussed, leading to a consideration of more sophisticated theories, such as Valence Bond Theory (VBT) and Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT).  VBT's explanation of hybridization and its implications for molecular geometry will be contrasted with MOT's description of bonding and anti-bonding orbitals, emphasizing the strengths and weaknesses of each approach.  The presentation will conclude by demonstrating how a thorough understanding of bonding and structure is crucial for predicting and interpreting various chemical and physical properties, including reactivity, spectroscopy, and macroscopic behaviour.  Examples will be drawn from diverse chemical systems to illustrate the breadth and depth of the subject's applications.
