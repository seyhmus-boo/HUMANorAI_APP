Precisely elucidating the mechanism of DNA replication presented significant experimental challenges.  Early investigations were hampered by the sheer complexity of the process, involving numerous enzymatic components and intricate regulatory pathways within the crowded cellular environment. Isolating and purifying individual enzymes, such as DNA polymerases, in sufficient quantities for biochemical characterization proved arduous.  Furthermore, the in vivo replication process is dynamic and rapid, making it difficult to capture intermediate steps using traditional biochemical techniques.  The high fidelity of replication, with error rates exceptionally low, presented another hurdle in studying the mechanism of proofreading and error correction.  Early attempts to visualize the replication process were limited by the resolution of available microscopy, making it challenging to directly observe the formation of the replication fork and the coordinated action of multiple enzymes.  Overcoming these obstacles required the development of sophisticated techniques including  in vitro replication systems, the use of radioisotopes to track DNA synthesis, and later, advanced imaging technologies such as electron microscopy and single-molecule techniques to visualize the process at high resolution and in real time.
