Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional structural and electronic properties, have garnered significant attention within the scientific community since their discovery.  Their unique combination of high tensile strength, remarkable elasticity, and exceptional electrical and thermal conductivity surpasses that of many conventional materials, opening avenues for a wide range of technological advancements. This paper explores the key properties of CNTs, focusing on their structural variations, including single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNTs), and the resulting impact on their mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics. We will delve into the influence of factors such as diameter, chirality, and defects on these properties.  Furthermore, we examine the current and potential practical applications of CNTs, spanning diverse fields such as composite materials for enhanced strength and lightweight construction in aerospace and automotive industries, energy storage in high-capacity batteries and supercapacitors, and biomedical applications including drug delivery and tissue engineering. The synthesis, functionalization, and characterization techniques crucial for realizing these applications will also be briefly discussed.  Ultimately, this review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of CNT properties and their implications for future technological innovations.
