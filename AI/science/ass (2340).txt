Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of atomic orbitals, described by wavefunctions, leading to a decrease in the overall system's energy.  This stabilization is primarily attributed to the overlap of atomic orbitals, creating molecular orbitals that encompass multiple nuclei.  Constructive interference of wavefunctions produces bonding molecular orbitals, which are lower in energy than the constituent atomic orbitals, accommodating electrons and contributing to bond formation.  Conversely, destructive interference forms antibonding orbitals, higher in energy and generally unoccupied in stable molecules.

The geometry of a molecule, its structure, is determined by the spatial distribution of electrons within these molecular orbitals.  Repulsion between electron pairs, both bonding and non-bonding (lone pairs), dictates bond angles and overall molecular shape, as described by Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory.  More sophisticated models, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), utilize electron density calculations to predict molecular geometries and properties with greater accuracy, accounting for electron correlation effects not fully captured by simpler models.  Ultimately, the structure is a consequence of the minimization of the total energy of the system, a principle arising directly from the quantum mechanical framework.
