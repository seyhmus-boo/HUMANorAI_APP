Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, typically uranium or plutonium, into lighter nuclei, releasing substantial energy.  This process, underpinning current nuclear power generation, involves bombarding the nucleus with neutrons, initiating a chain reaction.  Criticality, the point at which the chain reaction sustains itself, is carefully controlled in reactors through neutron moderation and absorption.

Recent developments in fission research primarily address improving reactor efficiency and safety.  Advanced reactor designs, such as molten salt reactors (MSRs), are gaining traction.  MSRs offer inherent safety features due to their liquid fuel, allowing for passive safety mechanisms and enhanced fuel utilization.  Furthermore, research continues into innovative fuel cycles, including the exploration of thorium-based fuels, which offer potentially enhanced proliferation resistance and reduced waste production.  These advancements aim to address public concerns regarding nuclear waste disposal and reactor safety, thereby fostering a renewed interest in nuclear fission as a viable energy source.
