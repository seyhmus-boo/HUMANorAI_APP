Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  Historically, the theoretical groundwork was laid by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century, who conceptually described "dark stars" whose gravitational pull prevented light's escape.  However, the modern understanding emerged with Einstein's general theory of relativity in the early 20th century, which provided the framework for describing spacetime curvature and gravitational singularities.

The process begins with a star exceeding approximately three times the Sun's mass.  Upon exhausting its nuclear fuel, the star's core loses outward pressure, initiating a catastrophic collapse.  If the core's mass surpasses the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 solar masses), electron degeneracy pressure proves insufficient to counter gravity.  This inexorable collapse leads to a singularity – a point of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon, a boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  The resulting object, a black hole, warps spacetime significantly, exhibiting profound gravitational effects observable through its interaction with surrounding matter.  The specifics of the collapse, including the presence of rotation, determine the black hole's characteristics, including its mass and angular momentum.
