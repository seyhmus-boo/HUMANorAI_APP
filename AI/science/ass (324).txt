Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic chemistry, enabling the efficient and selective synthesis of complex molecules.  This presentation will provide an overview of the diverse roles catalysts play in organic transformations, focusing on their impact on reaction rate, selectivity, and atom economy.  We will explore various catalytic strategies, including homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, highlighting examples from recent literature.  Particular emphasis will be placed on the development of sustainable and environmentally benign catalytic systems, such as those employing metal nanoparticles, biocatalysts (enzymes), and organocatalysts.  The presentation will showcase how advancements in catalyst design, including ligand modifications and support materials, have led to significant improvements in reaction efficiency and the ability to access previously inaccessible molecules.  Finally, we will briefly discuss current challenges and future directions in the field, including the design of more robust, recyclable, and highly selective catalysts for challenging transformations, and the integration of AI-driven approaches in catalyst discovery and optimization.  This overview aims to provide attendees with a comprehensive understanding of the crucial role of catalysis in advancing the frontiers of organic synthesis.
