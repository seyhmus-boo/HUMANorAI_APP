The formation of black holes, enigmatic objects possessing gravitational fields so intense that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical work by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century, predating Einstein's general relativity, posited the existence of "dark stars" based on Newtonian gravity. However, it was Einstein's theory that provided the rigorous framework for understanding black hole formation.

The process hinges on the collapse of extremely massive stars.  When a star many times the mass of our Sun exhausts its nuclear fuel, the outward pressure counteracting gravity fails.  This triggers a catastrophic gravitational collapse, compressing the stellar core to an infinitesimally small point – a singularity – surrounded by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which escape is impossible.  The precise mechanism is complex, involving intricate interplay between nuclear processes, neutrino emission, and the formation of neutron stars as intermediate stages.  Different stellar masses lead to varying black hole sizes, ranging from stellar-mass black holes to supermassive black holes residing at galactic centres, the origins of which remain an area of active research, with hypotheses including seed black holes and mergers.
