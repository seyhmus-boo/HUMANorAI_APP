Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in the life cycle of massive stars.  When a star with a mass exceeding approximately 20 solar masses exhausts its nuclear fuel, the outward pressure from fusion ceases.  Gravity overwhelms the remaining stellar structure, causing a catastrophic collapse.  This implosion compresses the core to an incredibly dense state, exceeding even the density of neutron stars, resulting in the formation of a singularity â€“ a point of infinite density at the center of a black hole.  The immense gravitational pull prevents even light from escaping within the event horizon, a boundary defined by the black hole's Schwarzschild radius.  Less massive stars, those with a mass between approximately 8 and 20 solar masses, ultimately form neutron stars.  However, the precise mechanism and details of black hole formation remain active areas of research, with ongoing investigations focusing on aspects like accretion disks, relativistic jets, and the influence of stellar rotation.  Practically, understanding black hole formation aids in modelling galactic evolution, interpreting gravitational wave observations (resulting from black hole mergers), and refining our comprehension of extreme gravitational environments, potentially informing future advancements in theoretical physics and potentially even high-density materials science.
