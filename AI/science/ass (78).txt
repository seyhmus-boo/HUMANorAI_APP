Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit a unique confluence of exceptional properties that underpin their interdisciplinary applications.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength, surpassing that of steel by several orders of magnitude, is a key factor in materials science, enabling the development of high-strength composites and advanced fibers.  Furthermore, their remarkable electrical conductivity, tunable between metallic and semiconducting behavior depending on chirality, is crucial for electronics and sensors.  This electrical behavior intersects with their significant thermal conductivity, facilitating heat dissipation in microelectronics and opening avenues in thermal management applications.  The large surface area of CNTs plays a critical role in their efficacy as catalysts and adsorbents, impacting fields ranging from environmental remediation (e.g., water purification) to energy storage (e.g., supercapacitors).  Finally, their biocompatibility, although context-dependent, has spurred exploration in biomedical engineering, including drug delivery systems and tissue engineering scaffolds.  The interplay of these diverse properties underscores the inherent interdisciplinarity of CNT research, necessitating collaborative efforts across materials science, chemistry, physics, engineering, and biology to fully realize their potential.
