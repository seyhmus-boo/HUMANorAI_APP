Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of sp²-bonded carbon atoms.  Their discovery, serendipitously observed by Sumio Iijima in 1991 using transmission electron microscopy, revolutionized materials science.  CNTs exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, boasting tensile strength exceeding that of steel, while being significantly lighter.  This, combined with their high aspect ratio, renders them ideal for applications requiring high strength-to-weight ratios.

Furthermore, CNTs display outstanding electrical conductivity, exhibiting metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality – the arrangement of their hexagonal carbon lattice.  This tunable conductivity is crucial for electronic applications.  Their thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, exceeding that of diamond in some configurations, making them promising for thermal management systems.  Finally, their large surface area provides immense potential for applications in energy storage and catalysis.  These unique properties collectively position CNTs as a pivotal material in nanotechnology, with ongoing research exploring their vast potential across diverse fields.
