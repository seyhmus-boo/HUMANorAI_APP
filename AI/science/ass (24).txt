Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns chemical bonding and molecular structure, a cornerstone of modern chemistry.  Early understandings, stemming from Dalton's atomic theory in the early 19th century, posited atoms as indivisible entities. However, the subsequent discovery of electrons necessitated a revised perspective.  Gilbert N. Lewis, in the early 20th century, pioneered the concept of electron sharing, leading to the development of the covalent bond, explaining the stability of molecules like methane.  This was further refined by Linus Pauling's work on resonance and electronegativity, which provided a more nuanced understanding of bond polarity and molecular geometry.

Understanding molecular structure – the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms – is crucial, as it dictates a molecule's properties.  The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory provides a practical model for predicting shapes based on electron pair arrangements around a central atom.  Ultimately, the interplay between bonding and structure dictates a molecule's reactivity, physical properties, and biological function.  Further lectures will delve into specific bond types and explore the diverse molecular geometries encountered in organic and inorganic chemistry.
