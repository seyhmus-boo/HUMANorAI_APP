DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring genetic inheritance, presents significant experimental challenges despite decades of research.  This presentation will focus on key obstacles encountered in studying this intricate process, particularly in vivo.  Accurate measurement of replication fork speed and stability remains difficult, hampered by the dynamic nature of replication complexes and the inherent heterogeneity of genomic regions.  Furthermore, resolving the precise mechanisms of lesion bypass and the roles of various accessory proteins necessitates advanced methodologies.  Current limitations in visualizing replication in real-time at high resolution within the complex cellular environment pose a significant hurdle.  We will discuss the limitations of established techniques such as single-molecule imaging, ChIP-seq, and pulse-chase experiments, highlighting their inherent biases and resolution limits.  Finally, we will explore emerging technologies with potential to overcome these challenges, including advanced microscopy techniques and sophisticated computational approaches for data analysis, emphasizing the need for integrated multi-faceted experimental strategies to achieve a more complete understanding of DNA replication dynamics.
