Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them promising candidates for a wide range of applications. This presentation will review the fundamental properties of CNTs, focusing on their unique structural features and how these dictate their macroscopic behavior.  We will explore the distinctions between single-walled (SWCNTs) and multi-walled (MWCNTs) nanotubes, highlighting the influence of chirality and diameter on their electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior.  Recent advancements in controlled synthesis techniques, enabling precise control over nanotube diameter, chirality, and length, will be discussed, emphasizing their impact on device performance.  The presentation will further address current research in functionalization strategies, focusing on the enhancement of CNT dispersibility and the introduction of novel functionalities for applications such as sensors, energy storage, and composites.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the ongoing challenges related to large-scale production, purification, and characterization of high-quality CNTs, outlining directions for future research and development in this rapidly evolving field.
