Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have captivated researchers since their discovery by Iijima in 1991.  This presentation will explore the remarkable properties of CNTs that underpin their potential for transformative applications across diverse fields.  Their unique structure, characterized by spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices, gives rise to exceptional mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel, alongside remarkable flexibility and high aspect ratios.  This exceptional strength stems from the strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms and the inherent structural perfection achievable in some synthesis methods.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, with their behaviour tunable between metallic and semiconducting depending on chirality.  Their high thermal conductivity makes them attractive for thermal management applications.  

However, realizing the full potential of CNTs faces challenges.  These include controlling the precise chirality and diameter during synthesis, efficient dispersion in matrices for composite materials, and scalable, cost-effective production.  This presentation will briefly address these challenges and discuss ongoing research aimed at overcoming these limitations, paving the way for broader integration of CNTs into advanced technologies.  We will conclude with a brief overview of current and future applications, ranging from electronics and composites to energy storage and biomedical devices.
