Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 through transmission electron microscopy, exhibit a unique combination of properties stemming from their exceptional structure.  These cylindrical structures, composed solely of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, are categorized into single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), depending on the number of concentric cylinders.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel on a weight basis, is attributed to the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheets composing the nanotube walls.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, with behaviour ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on their chirality (the angle of the hexagonal lattice relative to the nanotube axis). This tunable conductivity underpins their potential in electronic applications.  Their high aspect ratio (length-to-diameter) leads to significant surface area, making them ideal for applications requiring adsorption or catalysis. Finally, CNTs also exhibit remarkable thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper in certain orientations, owing to the efficient phonon transport along the nanotube axis.  These exceptional properties, coupled with their potential for scalable production, have fuelled extensive research into their application across diverse fields, including materials science, electronics, and energy storage.
