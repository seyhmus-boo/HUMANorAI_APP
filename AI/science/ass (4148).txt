While classical biochemistry adequately describes the overall process of DNA replication, a quantum mechanical perspective offers intriguing possibilities for a more complete understanding.  The fidelity of DNA replication, remarkably high despite inherent thermal fluctuations, may be influenced by quantum tunneling effects.  Specifically,  proton transfer during hydrogen bond breaking and formation, critical steps in base pairing, could be facilitated by quantum tunneling, circumventing high activation energy barriers predicted by classical mechanics.  Furthermore, the precise positioning of DNA polymerase along the template strand, crucial for accurate base selection, might benefit from quantum coherence phenomena.  Superposition and entanglement of electron states within the enzyme-DNA complex could enhance the specificity and efficiency of catalysis.  Investigating the role of quantum entanglement in enzyme-substrate interactions is especially relevant.  While experimental verification remains challenging, a fully quantum mechanical description of DNA replication could potentially reveal subtle yet impactful features enhancing our comprehension of genetic stability and evolutionary processes.
