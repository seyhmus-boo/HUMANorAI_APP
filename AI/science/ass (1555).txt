Photosynthesis, the process by which light energy is converted into chemical energy, has been a subject of scientific inquiry for centuries.  Early observations, such as Jan Ingenhousz's 1779 demonstration of light's necessity, laid the groundwork for understanding its fundamental components.  The overall reaction, the conversion of carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen, was later elucidated.

The process is broadly divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The light-dependent reactions, occurring in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, involve photosystems I and II.  Light absorption excites electrons, driving electron transport chains that generate ATP and NADPH.  Oxygen is released as a byproduct of water splitting (photolysis).

The light-independent reactions utilize the ATP and NADPH generated to fix atmospheric CO2 into organic molecules through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.  This carbon fixation, primarily mediated by Rubisco, ultimately produces glucose, the primary energy source for the plant.  Variations in photosynthetic mechanisms exist, including C4 and CAM pathways, which have evolved as adaptations to arid or high-light environments.  Ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of this crucial biological process.
