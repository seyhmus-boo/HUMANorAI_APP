CRISPR-Cas systems, derived from bacterial adaptive immunity, represent a revolutionary advancement in genetic engineering.  This lecture will explore the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9, the most widely utilized system.  We will examine the guided RNA (gRNA) directed targeting of specific DNA sequences, followed by the Cas9 nuclease-mediated double-stranded break.  This break initiates cellular DNA repair mechanisms, namely non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) leading to gene disruption or homologous recombination (HR) enabling precise gene editing. The lecture will discuss the versatility of CRISPR, encompassing gene knockouts, knock-ins, and base editing, highlighting its applications across diverse fields. We will critically evaluate the off-target effects and ethical considerations associated with CRISPR technology, emphasizing the need for rigorous validation and responsible implementation. Finally, we will briefly survey emerging CRISPR variants and their potential to further refine gene editing precision and expand therapeutic applications.
