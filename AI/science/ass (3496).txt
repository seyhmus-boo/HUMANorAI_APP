CRISPR-Cas systems, derived from bacterial adaptive immunity, have revolutionized genetic engineering.  This lecture will explore the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9, the most widely utilized system, highlighting its simplicity and efficiency.  Guide RNA (gRNA) directs the Cas9 nuclease to a specific DNA sequence, inducing a double-stranded break.  Cellular repair mechanisms, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair (HDR), then process the break. NHEJ frequently results in insertions or deletions (indels), causing gene disruption, while HDR allows precise gene editing using a provided DNA template.  The lecture will discuss applications of CRISPR, including gene therapy for inherited diseases, disease modelling in vitro and in vivo, and the generation of genetically modified organisms for agricultural and industrial purposes.  Furthermore, ethical considerations surrounding CRISPR technology, including off-target effects and potential misuse, will be addressed.  Finally, emerging CRISPR-based technologies, such as base editing and prime editing, which offer improved precision and expanded capabilities, will be briefly reviewed.
