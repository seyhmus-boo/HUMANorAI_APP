Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms, have garnered significant attention within the scientific community due to their exceptional and diverse physicochemical properties.  Their unique combination of high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity, and exceptional thermal conductivity surpasses that of many conventional materials, making them attractive candidates for a wide range of applications. This paper will explore the key properties that underpin the potential of CNTs, examining their mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics in detail.  We will analyze the influence of structural parameters, such as diameter, chirality, and length, on these properties, and discuss the impact of different synthesis methods on the resultant material quality.  The practical implications of these properties will be highlighted, focusing on their potential use in advanced composite materials, high-performance electronics, energy storage devices (such as batteries and supercapacitors), and biomedical applications, including drug delivery and biosensors.  A critical assessment of current challenges and future research directions within the field will conclude the paper.
