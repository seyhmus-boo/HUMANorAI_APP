Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, constitutes a significant energy-releasing process.  This phenomenon, primarily driven by the strong nuclear force and countered by electromagnetic repulsion, is initiated by neutron bombardment.  The absorption of a neutron by a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, leads to an unstable, highly energetic intermediate state.  This unstable nucleus subsequently undergoes fission, yielding smaller daughter nuclei, a variable number of neutrons, and a considerable release of energy, primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and prompt gamma radiation.  The emitted neutrons can then induce further fission events in a chain reaction, provided a critical mass of fissile material is present.  The efficiency of this process is determined by factors including neutron cross-sections, neutron leakage, and the presence of neutron moderators or absorbers.  Understanding these parameters is crucial for controlling fission reactions in nuclear reactors and for developing nuclear weapons.  Further research focuses on improving the efficiency and safety of nuclear fission technologies, including advanced reactor designs and waste management strategies.
