Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, are cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized structure.  Their discovery revolutionized materials science, opening avenues for numerous applications.  Crucially, CNTs exhibit remarkable mechanical strength, possessing tensile strengths significantly exceeding steel, coupled with high elasticity.  This strength, alongside their low density, makes them ideal for reinforcement in composite materials.

Electrically, CNTs demonstrate diverse behaviour depending on their chirality (the arrangement of carbon atoms).  Armchair nanotubes are metallic conductors, while zigzag and chiral nanotubes can exhibit semiconducting properties, analogous to silicon, making them promising candidates for next-generation electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation, and exhibit exceptional chemical stability, resisting degradation under various conditions.  However, challenges remain in scalable, cost-effective production and in overcoming difficulties related to dispersion and functionalization for optimal integration into practical applications.  Ongoing research continues to explore the full potential of CNTs across diverse fields.
