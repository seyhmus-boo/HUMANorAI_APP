Nuclear fission is the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and ionizing radiation. This process is initiated by neutron bombardment, which causes the nucleus to become unstable and undergo fission.  The fission event also produces additional neutrons, creating the potential for a chain reaction, whereby each fission event triggers further fissions.  The rate of this reaction is controlled in nuclear reactors through the use of neutron-absorbing control rods.

The immense energy released during fission has several practical applications.  Primarily, it fuels nuclear power plants, providing a low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels for electricity generation.  However, the process also presents significant challenges related to nuclear waste disposal and the risk of accidental releases of radiation.  Furthermore, the same principle underlies the function of nuclear weapons, where uncontrolled chain reactions produce devastating explosive yields.  Research continues to explore advanced reactor designs aiming to enhance safety, improve fuel efficiency, and mitigate the proliferation risks associated with fissile materials.
