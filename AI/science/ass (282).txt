Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission through a quantum mechanical lens.  Unlike classical mechanics, which cannot adequately explain the stability of nuclei, quantum mechanics provides the crucial framework.  The strong nuclear force, governed by the exchange of gluons, binds protons and neutrons within the nucleus, but this force has a limited range.  As the atomic number increases, the electrostatic repulsion between protons becomes increasingly significant, destabilizing larger nuclei.

Quantum tunneling plays a critical role.  The potential energy barrier preventing spontaneous fission is finite.  According to quantum mechanics, there's a non-zero probability that a nucleus can tunnel through this barrier, leading to fission. The probability of tunneling, determined by the height and width of the barrier, is highly dependent on the nuclear shape and isotopic composition.  Neutron bombardment further destabilizes the nucleus, increasing the probability of tunneling and consequently initiating the fission process.  The subsequent release of neutrons sustains a chain reaction, a phenomenon explained by the probabilistic nature of nuclear interactions within the quantum mechanical regime.  Further exploration delves into the complexities of nuclear shell models and their influence on fission dynamics.
