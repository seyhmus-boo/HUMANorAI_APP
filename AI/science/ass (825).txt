This presentation explores the unique properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the lens of quantum mechanics.  We will examine how the exceptional strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity of CNTs arise from their atomic-scale structure and the resulting electronic band structure.  Specifically, we will discuss the role of π-electron delocalization within the sp² hybridized carbon network, highlighting the formation of one-dimensional bands and the influence of tube diameter and chirality on the resulting electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior.  The quantum confinement effect in CNTs and its impact on their optical and electronic transitions will be analyzed.  Furthermore, we will briefly address the challenges in accurately predicting CNT properties using quantum mechanical methods, including the computational cost associated with large-scale systems and the need for advanced theoretical approaches to account for electron-electron interactions and many-body effects.  Finally, the presentation will touch upon the potential of quantum mechanical modeling in guiding the design and synthesis of CNTs with tailored properties for applications in nanoelectronics, energy storage, and composite materials.
