Nuclear fission is the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and free neutrons.  This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the daughter nuclei is less than the parent nucleus; this mass difference is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  The released neutrons can then induce further fission events in a chain reaction, creating a self-sustaining process crucial for nuclear power generation.  The chain reaction's rate is controlled in nuclear reactors using control rods which absorb neutrons, thus regulating the fission rate and power output.

Practical applications of nuclear fission are primarily focused on energy production.  Nuclear power plants utilize controlled chain reactions to generate heat, which is then used to produce steam and drive turbines, generating electricity.  This provides a significant, albeit controversial, source of baseload power, offering energy independence and reduced greenhouse gas emissions compared to fossil fuels.  However, the process also generates radioactive waste, posing long-term storage and disposal challenges.  Furthermore, the potential for nuclear accidents, like Chernobyl and Fukushima, highlights the inherent risks associated with this technology.  Beyond power generation, fission finds applications in medical isotopes for diagnosis and treatment, and in specialized industrial processes requiring high-intensity radiation.
