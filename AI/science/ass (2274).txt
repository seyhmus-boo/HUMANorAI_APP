Plasma physics encompasses a diverse range of phenomena arising from the collective behaviour of ionized gases.  This lecture will survey key aspects of these phenomena, focusing on fundamental processes governing macroscopic plasma properties. We will explore Debye shielding, where the long-range Coulomb interaction is screened by surrounding charges, establishing a characteristic length scale for plasma behavior.  The concept of plasma frequency, representing the natural oscillation of electrons around ions, will be introduced as a critical parameter defining plasma dynamics.  Further, we will examine wave propagation in plasmas, including Langmuir waves and ion-acoustic waves, highlighting the dispersive nature of these oscillations and their dependence on plasma parameters like temperature and density.  Finally, the lecture will briefly touch upon magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), emphasizing the interplay between plasma flow and magnetic fields, and its importance in understanding complex phenomena like magnetic confinement and solar flares.  The lecture aims to provide a foundational understanding of these core concepts, laying the groundwork for deeper exploration into specific plasma applications.
