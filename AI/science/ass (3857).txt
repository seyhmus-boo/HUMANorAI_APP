Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  Imagine a sheet of graphene, a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, rolled into a seamless cylinder. This, in essence, is a CNT. This unique structure bestows exceptional properties.

Firstly, their *strength*:  Consider a steel cable; CNTs possess tensile strength far exceeding this, making them exceptionally strong relative to their weight â€“ think of a feather supporting a small car.  Secondly, *electrical conductivity*: Depending on their chirality (the way the graphene sheet is rolled), CNTs can behave as either metallic conductors, similar to copper wires efficiently transmitting electricity, or as semiconductors, analogous to silicon in transistors, allowing for controlled electron flow.  Finally, *thermal conductivity*:  Visualize heat readily dissipating through a copper pipe; CNTs exhibit extraordinarily high thermal conductivity, efficiently transferring heat. These exceptional properties render CNTs highly promising for applications in diverse fields ranging from materials science to electronics and medicine.
