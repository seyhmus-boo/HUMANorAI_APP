CRISPR-Cas systems, derived from bacterial adaptive immunity, have revolutionized genetic engineering.  This lecture outlines the core mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas9, the most widely utilized system.  The system relies on a guide RNA (gRNA) molecule, complementary to a target DNA sequence, which directs the Cas9 nuclease to the precise genomic location.  Cas9 then induces a double-stranded break, stimulating cellular DNA repair mechanisms.  These mechanisms, non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR), can be exploited for gene knockout or precise gene editing, respectively.  NHEJ frequently introduces insertions or deletions, disrupting gene function, while HDR utilizes a provided DNA template for accurate gene replacement or modification.  The lecture will further explore the advancements beyond Cas9, including base editors and prime editors, which offer enhanced precision and broader editing capabilities, minimizing off-target effects.  Finally, ethical implications and potential applications in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology will be briefly discussed.
