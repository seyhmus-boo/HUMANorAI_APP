Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for diverse technological applications.  However, realizing their full potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  This paper focuses on the key experimental difficulties encountered in characterizing and manipulating CNTs, ultimately hindering the reliable and scalable fabrication of CNT-based devices.  The inherent variability in CNT properties, arising from variations in diameter, chirality, and structural defects, presents a significant hurdle in obtaining consistent and reproducible results.  Precise control over CNT synthesis, crucial for achieving desired structural parameters and minimizing impurities, remains a considerable technological challenge.  Furthermore, the robust characterization of individual CNT properties, particularly chirality determination and defect identification, requires sophisticated and often time-consuming techniques such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy.  Finally, the efficient dispersion and functionalization of CNTs, necessary for their integration into composite materials and devices, poses a considerable obstacle due to their strong van der Waals interactions and hydrophobic nature.  This paper will examine these experimental limitations in detail, discussing current mitigation strategies and proposing directions for future research.
