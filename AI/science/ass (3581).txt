DNA replication, the process by which a double-stranded DNA molecule is duplicated, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding of its mechanism emerged from experiments in the mid-20th century.  Avery, MacLeod, and McCarty's 1944 demonstration that DNA, not protein, carried hereditary information laid crucial groundwork.  Subsequently, Chargaff's rules, detailing the equivalence of purine and pyrimidine bases, contributed to the conceptualization of base pairing.  The pivotal discovery of the double helix structure by Watson and Crick in 1953 provided the structural framework for understanding replication.  Their model, featuring antiparallel strands and complementary base pairing, immediately suggested a semiconservative mechanism, later experimentally confirmed by Meselson and Stahl using density gradient centrifugation.  This semiconservative model posits that each new DNA molecule retains one parental strand and incorporates one newly synthesized strand.  The process itself involves a complex interplay of enzymes, including DNA polymerase, helicase, and primase, working in concert to unwind the double helix, synthesize new strands, and proofread for errors, ensuring high fidelity replication vital for maintaining genomic integrity across generations.
