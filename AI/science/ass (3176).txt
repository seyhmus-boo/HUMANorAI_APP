The formation of black holes, while classically understood through gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, necessitates a quantum mechanical perspective to fully elucidate the process, particularly at the singularity.  The classical description breaks down at the Planck scale where gravitational forces become dominant and quantum effects become significant.  The precise mechanism remains an open question, but several theoretical approaches attempt to incorporate quantum gravity.  Loop quantum gravity, for instance, proposes that spacetime itself becomes quantized, preventing the formation of a singularity by introducing a minimum length scale.  This could result in a "quantum bounce," where the collapse is halted and replaced by an expansion, potentially forming a stable remnant object differing significantly from the classical black hole.  String theory offers another avenue, suggesting that black holes are not truly singular but rather complex, highly-entangled states of strings, resolving the singularity issue through a fuzzier, less-defined structure.  Understanding black hole formation through these quantum frameworks is crucial to resolving the information paradox, reconciling general relativity with quantum mechanics, and ultimately comprehending the ultimate fate of collapsing matter.
