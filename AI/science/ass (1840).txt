Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the distance separating them, lies at the heart of many proposed quantum technologies.  While the theoretical framework is well-established, realizing the full potential of entangled systems faces significant experimental hurdles. This paper examines the key challenges encountered in generating, manipulating, and maintaining entanglement, focusing on the practical limitations currently hindering widespread application.  These challenges encompass several interconnected areas: the creation of high-fidelity entangled states, particularly for larger numbers of particles, which is hampered by decoherence and imperfections in experimental apparatus.  Furthermore, preserving entanglement over extended periods and distances requires sophisticated techniques to mitigate noise and environmental interactions.  The efficient manipulation of entangled states, for example, through quantum gates, presents further obstacles stemming from control precision and scalability.  Finally, the characterization and verification of entanglement itself pose significant metrological problems, requiring the development of increasingly sensitive and robust measurement techniques.  This paper will delve into these experimental challenges, examining current mitigation strategies and proposing avenues for future research aimed at overcoming these limitations and unlocking the full potential of quantum entanglement.
