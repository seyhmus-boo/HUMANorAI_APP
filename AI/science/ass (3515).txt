DNA replication, the precise duplication of the genome, is fundamental to life. This presentation will provide a concise overview of this critical process, tracing its historical understanding from early conceptualizations to current mechanistic details.  We will begin by briefly exploring the pre-Watson-Crick era, highlighting the crucial contributions of researchers like Chargaff, whose base-pairing rules foreshadowed the double helix model.  The discovery of the double helix itself revolutionized the field, providing the structural framework for understanding semi-conservative replication, a hypothesis experimentally verified by Meselson and Stahl.

The presentation will then delve into the key enzymes and proteins involved in replication, including DNA polymerases, helicases, primases, and ligases, emphasizing their coordinated actions in initiating, elongating, and proofreading the newly synthesized DNA strands.  We will discuss the differences between leading and lagging strand synthesis, the role of Okazaki fragments, and the challenges posed by telomere replication.  Finally, we will touch upon the intricacies of replication regulation and its implications in genome stability and diseases arising from replication errors.  The presentation aims to provide a foundational understanding of DNA replication, highlighting its elegance and complexity.
