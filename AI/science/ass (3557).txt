Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of sp² hybridised carbon atoms.  Their discovery, albeit initially unintentional, in the late 1980s and early 1990s by Sumio Iijima and colleagues, revolutionised materials science.

CNTs exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, boasting tensile strengths significantly higher than steel, owing to the strong covalent bonds within their hexagonal lattice structure.  Their electrical properties are equally impressive; depending on chirality (the arrangement of carbon atoms), they can behave as either metallic conductors or semiconductors. This tunability makes them highly attractive for nanoelectronics.

Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation, and exhibit remarkable chemical inertness, rendering them suitable for various applications under harsh conditions.  Their high aspect ratio – significant length compared to diameter – contributes to their exceptional properties and allows for unique applications in composites, sensors, and energy storage devices.  However, challenges remain in scalable, cost-effective production and precise manipulation.
