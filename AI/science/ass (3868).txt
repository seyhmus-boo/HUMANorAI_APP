Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission.  Imagine an atom's nucleus, particularly a heavy one like Uranium, as a delicately balanced, oversized bowling ball.  This ball represents a collection of protons and neutrons bound together by the strong nuclear force. Now, imagine striking this ball with a tiny neutron – our bowling ball's "spare" – a single, high-speed particle.

This impact disrupts the delicate balance, causing the "bowling ball" to become unstable and split into two smaller "balls," representing the fission fragments.  This splitting isn't random; it's guided by the strong and weak nuclear forces, resulting in specific daughter nuclei.  Crucially, the combined mass of these smaller "balls" is slightly less than the original. This "missing" mass, in accordance with Einstein's E=mc², is converted into a tremendous amount of energy – the "spare" pins flying everywhere after a perfectly executed strike. This released energy manifests as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and, significantly, as additional neutrons, which can then initiate further fissions, creating a chain reaction, like a cascade of perfectly executed strikes, each knock setting off another.  Understanding this chain reaction is key to comprehending nuclear power and weaponry.
