This presentation addresses experimental challenges encountered in the elucidation of chemical bonding and molecular structure.  While theoretical advancements provide increasingly accurate predictions, experimental verification remains crucial, particularly for complex systems and novel materials.  We will discuss the limitations of established techniques such as X-ray diffraction, which can struggle with disordered or dynamic structures, and NMR spectroscopy, whose resolution can be hampered by spectral crowding in large molecules.  The inherent difficulties in probing weak interactions, vital for understanding supramolecular assemblies and biological systems, will be highlighted.  Furthermore, the challenges of characterizing transient species and reaction intermediates, crucial for understanding reaction mechanisms, will be explored.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon emerging techniques, such as advanced electron microscopy and ultrafast spectroscopy, and their potential to overcome some of these limitations, paving the way for a more comprehensive understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure in diverse environments.  The discussion will emphasize the need for a multi-technique approach to comprehensively characterize complex molecular systems.
