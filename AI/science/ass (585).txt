Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating process of black hole formation.  Imagine a massive star, a celestial behemoth many times larger than our Sun, nearing the end of its nuclear fusion lifecycle.  Its core, once a furnace of energy production, now collapses under its own immense gravity. Think of it as a deflating balloon; the pressure supporting the star's structure against the crushing force of gravity is gone.

This collapse is catastrophic.  If the stellar remnant's mass exceeds a critical threshold, approximately three times the Sun's mass, no known force can resist the unrelenting gravitational pull.  The matter compresses into an infinitesimally small point, a singularity.  This process generates a region of spacetime with such intense gravity that not even light can escape, hence the term "black hole."  Visualise this as a cosmic drain, its gravitational field acting like a whirlpool, inevitably drawing in surrounding matter.  Different progenitor star masses lead to black holes of varying sizes, from stellar-mass black holes born from this stellar collapse to supermassive black holes, whose origins remain an area of active research, potentially involving the merging of smaller black holes or direct collapse of massive gas clouds.  This marks the end of our stellar lifespan analogy, paving the way to explore further their profound impacts on galactic evolution.
