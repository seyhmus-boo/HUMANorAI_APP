Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential across diverse applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges. This presentation will focus on these critical hurdles in the characterization and manipulation of CNTs.  Specifically, we will address the difficulties in obtaining high purity, well-defined CNT samples, highlighting the challenges associated with catalyst control and purification techniques.  The inherent variability in CNT diameter, chirality, and structural defects contributes to inconsistent material properties, demanding advanced characterization techniques like high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy, which themselves present complexities in data interpretation and analysis.  Further, the strong tendency of CNTs to agglomerate poses significant challenges for processing and integration into devices, necessitating the development of effective dispersion and functionalization strategies.  Finally, we will discuss the limitations in accurately measuring and modeling the mechanical properties of individual CNTs and their composites, emphasizing the need for refined experimental methodologies and theoretical frameworks. Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for unlocking the full potential of CNTs in future technologies.
