The concept of chemical bonding, explaining the forces holding atoms together in molecules and crystals, emerged gradually from the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  Early attempts focused on valency, a rudimentary notion of combining capacity, predominantly observed empirically.  Gilbert N. Lewis's 1916 proposal of the octet rule, postulating that atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to achieve a stable configuration of eight valence electrons, provided a significant conceptual advance. This provided a framework for understanding ionic bonding, involving the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, and covalent bonding, where atoms share electron pairs to achieve octet stability.  Further refinement came with the development of quantum mechanics, providing a more rigorous theoretical basis for describing the electronic structure of molecules.  Molecular orbital theory, a powerful tool for predicting molecular geometry and reactivity, arose from this theoretical foundation, offering a more sophisticated description of bonding beyond simple electron-pair sharing.  Ultimately, the understanding of chemical bonding is inextricably linked to molecular structure, as the arrangement of atoms in a molecule directly reflects the nature and strength of the bonds between them. This relationship is crucial for predicting and understanding chemical and physical properties.
