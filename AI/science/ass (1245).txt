DNA replication, the precise duplication of the genetic material, is fundamental to life. This presentation will provide a concise overview of this intricate process, tracing its historical understanding from early conceptualizations to contemporary mechanistic details.  We will begin by briefly revisiting the seminal work of Watson and Crick, whose 1953 model of DNA's double helix structure immediately suggested a mechanism for semi-conservative replication.  Meselson and Stahl's elegant experiment subsequently confirmed this hypothesis, definitively demonstrating the semi-conservative nature of replication.

The presentation will then delve into the key enzymes and molecular events involved, including the action of helicases, primases, DNA polymerases, and ligases. We will explore the complexities of leading and lagging strand synthesis, the role of Okazaki fragments, and the mechanisms ensuring fidelity and minimizing errors.  Furthermore, we will touch upon the intricate regulation of replication timing and the challenges posed by the replication of telomeres.  Finally, we will briefly address current research directions focusing on the roles of replication in genomic instability and disease, highlighting the enduring significance of understanding this central biological process.
