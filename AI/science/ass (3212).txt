Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, present significant experimental challenges hindering their widespread application.  Their inherent propensity for aggregation, due to strong van der Waals forces, complicates dispersion in solvents and matrices, necessitating sophisticated techniques like ultrasonication and the use of surfactants.  Precise control over CNT chirality, crucial for tailoring their electronic properties, remains a significant hurdle.  Synthesis methods often yield a mixture of metallic and semiconducting nanotubes, requiring complex separation processes, such as density gradient ultracentrifugation or chromatography, which are often inefficient and scale poorly.

Furthermore, accurate characterization of CNT properties presents difficulties.  Determining the precise chirality and diameter distribution requires advanced techniques like high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy, both of which can be time-consuming and require specialized expertise.  Quantifying the purity and degree of functionalization is also challenging, impacting the reproducibility and reliability of experimental results.  Overcoming these experimental limitations is critical for unlocking the full potential of CNTs in diverse technological fields.
