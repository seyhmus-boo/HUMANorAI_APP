This presentation addresses the experimental challenges inherent in the determination and understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure.  While theoretical models provide valuable insights, experimental verification remains crucial for validating these models and advancing our understanding of chemical reactivity and properties.  We will explore the limitations and complexities associated with various experimental techniques, focusing on three key areas: (1)  Diffraction methods (X-ray, neutron, electron), highlighting challenges associated with sample preparation, data acquisition, and structural refinement, especially for complex or disordered systems. (2) Spectroscopic techniques (NMR, IR, Raman, UV-Vis), discussing limitations imposed by spectral resolution, signal-to-noise ratios, and the need for isotopic labelling or specific experimental conditions to extract meaningful structural information. (3)  Microscopy (TEM, STM, AFM), examining the inherent limitations of spatial resolution and the potential for sample damage under high-resolution imaging.  The presentation will conclude by discussing emerging techniques and strategies that aim to overcome these experimental hurdles and provide more comprehensive insights into chemical bonding and molecular structure, thereby further bridging the gap between theory and experiment.
