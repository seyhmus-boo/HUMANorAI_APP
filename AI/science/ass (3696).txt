Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems that persists even when spatially separated.  This non-classical correlation transcends classical notions of locality, manifesting as a strong statistical dependence between the measured properties of the entangled particles.  Crucially, the measurement outcome of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the outcome of measurements performed on the other, regardless of the distance separating them.  This does not, however, allow for faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of individual measurements remains probabilistic and unpredictable.  Entanglement is a resource for various quantum information processing tasks, including quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing. The degree of entanglement is quantified by measures such as entanglement entropy, which provides a measure of the correlation strength and degree of non-classicality.  Ongoing research focuses on creating and manipulating entangled states of increasingly complex systems, exploring both the fundamental implications of entanglement and its potential applications in emerging quantum technologies.
