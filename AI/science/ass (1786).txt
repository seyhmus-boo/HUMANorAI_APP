This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on the underlying physics and their practical applications. We will begin by examining the fundamental principles governing nuclear fission, including the role of critical mass, neutron moderation, and chain reactions.  Different fissionable isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, and their relative fissile properties will be discussed.  The presentation will then delve into the various reactor designs employed to harness fission energy, highlighting the distinctions between thermal and fast reactors, and addressing the critical considerations of reactor safety and waste management.  Finally, we will explore the significant practical applications of nuclear fission, primarily in electricity generation, but also touching upon its role in medical isotopes production (e.g., for cancer therapy) and research applications.  The presentation aims to provide a balanced perspective on the benefits and challenges associated with nuclear fission technology, acknowledging its contributions to energy security alongside the need for responsible development and deployment strategies.
