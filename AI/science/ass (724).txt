Black hole formation arises from the ultimate triumph of gravity over all other forces within a sufficiently massive star.  Imagine a colossal ball of gas, a star, perpetually fighting against its own immense gravitational pull.  Nuclear fusion, akin to a controlled explosion within the star's core, generates outward pressure, counteracting gravity's inward crush.  However, as the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, this outward pressure weakens.  This is analogous to a deflating balloon, losing its ability to resist the pressure of the surrounding air.

Consequently, gravity takes over, causing the star's core to collapse catastrophically.  If the core's mass exceeds a critical threshold (approximately three times the mass of our Sun),  no known force can halt the collapse. The matter is compressed into an infinitesimally small point of infinite density – the singularity – creating a region of spacetime from which even light cannot escape: a black hole.  This process is akin to squeezing a beach ball until it becomes a tiny, incredibly dense marble. The resulting gravitational distortion of spacetime around the singularity defines the black hole's event horizon, a boundary beyond which escape is impossible.
