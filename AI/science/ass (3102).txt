Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the interplay of the strong and electromagnetic forces, described by a complex many-body Hamiltonian.  Tunneling, a quintessential quantum phenomenon, plays a crucial role in initiating fission.  The initial state of the nucleus, described by a wavefunction, encompasses a range of configurations, including highly deformed shapes.  These deformed states possess a non-zero probability of transitioning, via tunneling, to a configuration beyond the fission barrier â€“ a potential energy surface separating the bound nucleus from its fission fragments.  This barrier penetration is probabilistic, explaining the statistical nature of fission.  Once the barrier is breached, the strong repulsive Coulomb force between the nascent fragments drives the separation, leading to the release of kinetic energy and neutrons.  The emitted neutrons can subsequently trigger further fission events, underpinning chain reactions.  Precise calculations require sophisticated numerical methods due to the complexity of the many-body problem and the strong interactions involved.
