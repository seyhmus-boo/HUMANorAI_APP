DNA replication is a semiconservative process ensuring the faithful duplication of genetic material prior to cell division.  Initiation involves unwinding the double helix at specific origins of replication by helicases, stabilized by single-strand binding proteins.  Topoisomerases prevent supercoiling ahead of the replication fork.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate synthesis, continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, forming Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I excises RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, creating a continuous lagging strand.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases.

Understanding DNA replication has numerous practical applications.  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology leverages this process for in vitro DNA amplification, crucial in diagnostics, forensics, and research.  The development of anti-viral drugs targeting viral DNA polymerases underscores the clinical significance of this process. Furthermore, studies of replication fidelity and error correction mechanisms are vital in cancer research, where mutations arising from replication errors can drive tumorigenesis.  Manipulating replication mechanisms holds potential for gene therapy strategies and genome editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9, which relies on cellular DNA repair pathways activated after targeted double-strand breaks.
