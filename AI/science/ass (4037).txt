Good morning. Today's lecture concerns catalysts in organic chemistry.  Imagine a mountain pass:  the reaction between two organic molecules is akin to traversing this challenging terrain. The activation energy – the energy needed to reach the pass summit – is often prohibitively high, rendering the reaction slow or impossible.  A catalyst, however, acts like a new, lower mountain pass, a more easily navigated route.

Catalysts, themselves unchanged by the reaction, provide an alternative reaction pathway with a lower activation energy.  They achieve this through various mechanisms, often involving the temporary formation of intermediate complexes. Think of a matchmaker facilitating a union – the catalyst interacts with reactants, forming a transient bond that lowers the energy barrier, enabling the desired transformation and subsequent catalyst release.  Importantly, catalysts do not alter the overall thermodynamics of the reaction; they only accelerate the rate at which equilibrium is achieved.  The end product remains the same, only the journey to reach it becomes significantly more efficient.  Understanding and manipulating catalysts is crucial for synthetic organic chemistry, allowing for the production of complex molecules with greater speed and selectivity.
