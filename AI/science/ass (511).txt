Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the quantum mechanical perspective on catalysts in organic chemistry.  Traditional explanations focus on reaction mechanisms and thermodynamics. However, a deeper understanding requires acknowledging the quantum mechanical nature of chemical bonding and reactivity.

Catalysts, by lowering the activation energy, accelerate reactions without being consumed.  This is achieved by providing alternative reaction pathways with lower energy barriers. From a quantum mechanical standpoint, catalysts achieve this by altering the molecular orbitals involved in the transition state.  They can achieve this through several mechanisms including stabilizing the transition state through orbital interactions, such as through donation or acceptance of electron density, effectively lowering its energy.  Furthermore, catalysts can facilitate the formation of new bonds by manipulating the spatial arrangement of reacting molecules, promoting optimal orbital overlap and hence increasing the reaction rate. These subtle orbital manipulations, often involving frontier molecular orbitals (FMOs), are key to catalytic activity and are only fully elucidated through quantum chemical calculations.  We will explore specific examples in later lectures.
