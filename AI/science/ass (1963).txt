Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, defies classical intuition by exhibiting strong correlations between spatially separated quantum systems.  This phenomenon, predicted by the formalism of quantum mechanics and experimentally confirmed numerous times, reveals the intrinsically non-local nature of quantum states.  Entangled particles, regardless of distance, exhibit correlated behavior upon measurement, violating Bell's inequalities, which are predicated on local realism.  The description relies on a composite quantum system represented by a superposition state that cannot be factored into individual states of the constituent particles.  This inseparability manifests in the violation of Bell's theorem, demonstrating the incompatibility of quantum mechanics with classical local realism.  However, entanglement does not permit faster-than-light communication, as measurement outcomes remain probabilistic and uncorrelated until a measurement is performed on one of the entangled particles.  Further research focuses on harnessing entanglement for applications in quantum computation and quantum communication, where its non-classical correlations offer significant advantages over classical approaches.  Despite its conceptual challenges, entanglement remains a vital element in understanding and applying the principles of quantum mechanics.
