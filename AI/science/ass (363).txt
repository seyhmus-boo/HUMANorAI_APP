This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on recent advancements that enhance both our fundamental understanding and practical applications.  We will begin by revisiting the core principles of nuclear fission, including the role of neutron moderation and criticality.  Emphasis will be placed on the diverse range of fissile materials and their respective characteristics, acknowledging the ongoing research into advanced fuels such as thorium.

Recent developments in computational modeling will be discussed, highlighting the increasing accuracy and efficiency of simulating fission reactions and predicting reactor performance.  This improved predictive capability is crucial for designing next-generation reactors, including those aimed at enhanced safety and waste minimization.  Furthermore, we will explore novel techniques in reactor control and monitoring, such as advanced instrumentation and AI-driven systems, which promise significant improvements in reactor efficiency and safety protocols.  Finally,  the presentation will touch upon the ongoing efforts to develop advanced separation techniques for nuclear waste, a critical area for responsible nuclear energy development.  This overview aims to provide a contemporary understanding of fission processes and their ongoing evolution.
