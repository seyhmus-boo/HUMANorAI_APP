Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, with recent developments refining our understanding of the progenitor stars and the intricate processes involved.  The traditional model posits that stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (typically >20 solar masses) at the end of their life cycle, following core-collapse supernovae.  However, recent observations, aided by gravitational wave detections from merging black hole binaries by LIGO and Virgo, challenge this simplistic view.  These observations reveal black holes with masses exceeding 60 solar masses, posing difficulties for standard stellar evolution models, suggesting either more massive progenitor stars or unexplored physical processes during the collapse phase.  Furthermore, advancements in numerical relativity simulations, incorporating magnetic fields and sophisticated equations of state, provide a more nuanced picture of the collapse dynamics, highlighting the influence of asymmetries and jets in the final stages of black hole formation.  Ongoing research focuses on elucidating the role of binary interactions and the potential contribution of pair-instability supernovae, which may explain the formation of the most massive black holes.  These combined observational and theoretical advances are leading to a more complete understanding of black hole demographics and their formation pathways within the broader context of stellar evolution and galactic environments.
