Black hole formation represents a culmination of stellar evolution under extreme gravitational conditions.  The process typically initiates with the demise of a sufficiently massive star (≥20 solar masses), whose core collapses following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel.  The cessation of outward pressure from fusion results in an inexorable inward gravitational force, overcoming electron degeneracy pressure and, subsequently, neutron degeneracy pressure. This implosion leads to the formation of a singularity, a point of infinite density, at the center.  The surrounding matter, initially undergoing a violent bounce, eventually accretes onto the singularity, forming an event horizon – the boundary beyond which even light cannot escape.  The specifics of the collapse depend on factors such as stellar rotation and initial mass, potentially leading to variations in the resulting black hole's properties, including its spin and mass.  Alternative formation mechanisms, though less common, include the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds in the early universe and the merger of stellar-mass black holes within dense stellar clusters.  Observational evidence supporting these formation scenarios comes from gravitational wave detections and the observation of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, hinting at a complex interplay of stellar and galactic evolution in shaping the black hole population of the universe.
