Catalysts exert a profound influence on the efficiency and selectivity of organic reactions, enabling transformations otherwise unattainable under practical conditions. This lecture explores the fundamental principles underpinning catalytic activity in organic chemistry, focusing on both homogeneous and heterogeneous systems.  Homogeneous catalysts, often transition metal complexes, interact intimately with reactants, facilitating bond breaking and formation through intermediate complex formation.  Their high selectivity stems from precise control over reaction pathways via steric and electronic factors. Conversely, heterogeneous catalysts, such as zeolites or metal nanoparticles, offer advantages in terms of ease of separation and reusability, although achieving comparable selectivity can prove more challenging. The lecture will delve into specific examples illustrating catalyst design principles, encompassing concepts such as ligand effects in homogeneous catalysis and surface modifications in heterogeneous catalysis.  Finally, the growing importance of sustainable catalysis, encompassing biocatalysis and the development of environmentally benign catalysts, will be discussed.  A critical evaluation of catalyst selection criteria, based on activity, selectivity, stability, and cost-effectiveness, will conclude the presentation.
