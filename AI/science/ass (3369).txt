Black hole formation is a captivating endpoint in stellar evolution, dictated by the interplay of gravity and internal stellar pressure.  Imagine a star as a colossal pressure cooker:  nuclear fusion, analogous to the heat source, counteracts the inward pull of gravity.  For stars significantly more massive than our Sun, this equilibrium is eventually shattered.  Once nuclear fuel is depleted, the pressure support vanishes, triggering a catastrophic gravitational collapse.

This collapse can follow two primary paths.  In lower-mass stars, electron degeneracy pressure momentarily halts the contraction, forming a neutron star – a city-sized object with density comparable to an atomic nucleus.  However, for stars exceeding a critical mass (roughly 20-30 times the Sun's mass), even this incredibly strong resistance is overcome.  Gravity's relentless grip compresses the stellar core to an infinitesimally small point of infinite density – a singularity – creating a black hole.  This process, akin to a collapsing building that implodes upon itself, distorts spacetime to such an extent that not even light can escape its gravitational pull.  The resulting black hole's size is defined by its event horizon, a boundary analogous to the point of no return for a falling object within its gravitational field.
