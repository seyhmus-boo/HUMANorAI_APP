Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are inextricably intertwined, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This interconnectedness manifests as a correlation between the measurable properties of the entangled systems, exceeding any classical explanation.  Specifically, the composite quantum state of the entangled particles cannot be expressed as a simple product of individual states; instead, it exists as a superposition of entangled states.  Measurements performed on one entangled particle instantaneously influence the results of measurements on the other, even across vast distances. This apparent non-locality does not violate causality, as no information can be transmitted faster than light; rather, it highlights the fundamentally non-classical nature of quantum correlations.  The precise nature of this correlation is determined by the specific entangled state, which can be manipulated through controlled quantum operations.  The violation of Bell's inequalities experimentally confirms the existence of entanglement and its profound departure from classical intuition, paving the way for applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.
