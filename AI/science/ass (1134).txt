Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked regardless of spatial separation, is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a crucial resource for emerging quantum technologies.  However, harnessing the power of entanglement for practical applications faces significant experimental challenges.  This presentation will address key obstacles in generating, maintaining, and manipulating entangled states, focusing on three primary areas:  (1)  **State generation:** Achieving high fidelity entanglement generation across diverse quantum systems (photonic, trapped-ion, superconducting) remains difficult, demanding precise control over intricate quantum interactions and significant resources.  (2) **Preservation of entanglement:** Environmental decoherence severely limits the coherence time of entangled states, necessitating advanced quantum error correction techniques or the development of robust, environmentally isolated systems.  (3)  **Entanglement manipulation and distribution:**  Efficient and reliable manipulation of entangled states, coupled with robust long-distance distribution via quantum communication channels, pose substantial technological hurdles, demanding advancements in both hardware and control protocols.  The presentation will conclude by discussing current research efforts to overcome these challenges and their potential impact on the future of quantum computing, communication, and sensing.
