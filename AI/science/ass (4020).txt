Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, represent a remarkable class of materials exhibiting exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure – cylindrical sheets of sp²-bonded carbon atoms.  Their discovery spurred intense research interest owing to a predicted combination of high tensile strength, exceptional electrical conductivity (depending on chirality), and remarkable thermal conductivity.  Early studies focused on characterizing these fundamental properties, demonstrating tensile strengths exceeding those of steel and thermal conductivities surpassing copper.  Research subsequently explored the influence of nanotube diameter, chirality (the arrangement of carbon atoms), and defects on these properties.  

The electrical properties, particularly the potential for metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on chiral angle, have driven applications in electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, their high surface area has led to exploration in energy storage, catalysis, and drug delivery. However, challenges remain, including controlled synthesis of specific nanotube structures and the development of scalable, cost-effective production methods, as well as addressing concerns regarding potential toxicity.  Despite these obstacles, the remarkable properties of CNTs ensure their continued relevance in materials science and nanotechnology.
