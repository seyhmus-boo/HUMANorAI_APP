DNA replication, the semiconservative process by which genetic material is duplicated, is fundamental to life.  Early experiments, notably Meselson and Stahl's 1958 work using density gradient centrifugation, definitively established the semiconservative nature of replication, disproving conservative and dispersive models.  This foundational discovery elucidated the mechanism by which each daughter strand receives one parental strand, ensuring genetic fidelity.  The process is initiated at specific origin sites, unwound by helicases, and stabilized by single-stranded binding proteins.  DNA polymerases, the key enzymes, synthesize new strands in a 5' to 3' direction, utilizing a pre-existing RNA primer synthesized by primases.  Leading strand synthesis occurs continuously, while lagging strand synthesis involves the formation of Okazaki fragments, requiring ligation for completion.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases and subsequent repair pathways that address errors introduced during replication.  Understanding the intricacies of DNA replication remains crucial, underpinning advancements in fields ranging from cancer biology to genetic engineering and synthetic biology.  Ongoing research continues to refine our knowledge of the complex interplay of proteins and regulatory mechanisms governing this essential biological process.
