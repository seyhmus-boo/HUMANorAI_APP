Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a crucial resource for quantum technologies.  Despite its fundamental importance, realizing and harnessing entanglement experimentally presents significant challenges.  Maintaining entanglement over extended periods is hampered by decoherence, arising from interactions with the environment.  This necessitates sophisticated isolation techniques, such as cryogenic cooling and vacuum chambers, pushing the limits of experimental control.  Furthermore, the generation of high-fidelity entangled states, particularly involving multiple particles, is demanding.  Sources like spontaneous parametric down-conversion, while widely used, suffer from low efficiency and require careful optimization.  Characterizing the entangled state, and verifying its properties against classical correlations, also poses a significant hurdle, requiring advanced quantum state tomography techniques with their inherent limitations in scalability and statistical precision.  Addressing these experimental challenges will be critical for advancing quantum computing, communication, and metrology based on entangled systems.  Future research must focus on improving entanglement generation, preservation, and characterization techniques to unlock the full potential of this remarkable quantum phenomenon.
