The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting such extreme gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a central problem in astrophysics.  Early theoretical groundwork, stemming from John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace's 18th-century conjectures on "dark stars,"  laid the conceptual foundation.  However, Einstein's general theory of relativity in the early 20th century provided the necessary framework to accurately describe these objects, revealing their formation as a consequence of gravitational collapse.

Primarily, stellar-mass black holes arise from the core collapse of massive stars (≥20 solar masses) at the end of their lifespan.  Once nuclear fusion ceases,  gravitational forces overwhelm the outward pressure, initiating a catastrophic inward collapse.  If the resulting remnant exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit,  no known force can halt the compression, leading to singularity formation and a black hole.  Supermassive black holes, found at galactic centers, pose a more complex origin story.  While stellar-mass mergers contribute, prevailing theories suggest formation via direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe or through a process of accretion and mergers of smaller black holes.  Ongoing research utilizes gravitational wave astronomy and sophisticated numerical simulations to further elucidate these formation pathways and refine theoretical models.
