Black hole formation remains a cornerstone of astrophysics, yet significant experimental challenges hinder our complete understanding.  This presentation will explore the key observational hurdles in verifying theoretical models of black hole genesis, focusing on stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  For stellar-mass black holes, the crucial phase of core collapse remains largely inaccessible to direct observation, necessitating reliance on indirect methods such as gravitational wave detection.  We will discuss the limitations of current gravitational wave detectors in resolving the nuances of the collapse process, particularly regarding progenitor star properties and the subsequent black hole spin.  The formation of supermassive black holes presents even greater challenges, with their rapid growth in the early universe defying current understanding.  Observational constraints rely heavily on the analysis of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback, which are subject to significant uncertainties in modelling accretion rates and jet propagation.  This presentation will conclude by outlining potential future observational strategies, including next-generation gravitational wave detectors, improved AGN modelling techniques, and the role of multi-messenger astronomy in bridging the gap between theory and observation in the complex field of black hole formation.
