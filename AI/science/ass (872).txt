Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the formation of black holes, a fascinating area of astrophysics.  Black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars. When a star many times more massive than our Sun exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer sustain itself against its own gravity. This leads to a catastrophic inward collapse, compressing matter into an infinitely dense singularity.  The immense gravitational pull prevents even light from escaping the event horizon, the boundary surrounding the singularity.

While directly observing black holes is impossible, we can infer their presence through their gravitational effects on surrounding matter.  Accretion disks, formed by swirling material spiraling into the black hole, emit intense radiation detectable across the electromagnetic spectrum.  This allows us to study their properties and indirectly confirm their existence.

The practical applications of this knowledge are emerging. Understanding black hole formation enhances our models of stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. Further, the study of gravitational waves, generated during black hole mergers, provides a novel method to probe the universe's structure and evolution, potentially offering insights into the fundamental laws of physics themselves.
