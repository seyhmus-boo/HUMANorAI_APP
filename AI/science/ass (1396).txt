Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, a cornerstone of molecular biology with significant interdisciplinary implications.  At its core, DNA replication is the semi-conservative process by which a cell duplicates its genome.  This fundamentally biochemical process, involving enzymes like DNA polymerase and helicase, is governed by the laws of thermodynamics and chemistry.  The accuracy of replication, crucial for maintaining genomic integrity, is a fascinating area of study for biophysicists investigating the mechanics of base pairing and error correction.  Moreover, understanding replication informs computational biology, allowing for the development of sophisticated algorithms used in genomic sequencing and phylogenetic analysis.  Failures in DNA replication contribute to mutations,  a subject deeply relevant to evolutionary biology, explaining adaptation and the emergence of novel traits.  Furthermore, these failures are central to cancer biology and medicine, where uncontrolled replication is a hallmark of malignancy.  Thus, studying DNA replication transcends disciplinary boundaries, encompassing chemistry, physics, computer science, evolutionary biology, and medicine.
