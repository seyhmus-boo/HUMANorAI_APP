Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission, the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy. This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the daughter nuclei is slightly less than the parent nucleus, the difference being converted to energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².

The fission process typically requires the bombardment of a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with a neutron.  This neutron absorption initiates a chain reaction, as the resulting unstable nucleus undergoes fission, releasing further neutrons that can induce fission in other nuclei. This self-sustaining reaction is the basis of nuclear power generation.

Controlled fission reactions within nuclear reactors are harnessed to produce heat, used to generate steam and drive turbines for electricity production.  Furthermore,  fission has played a role in the development of nuclear weapons, although this application carries significant ethical and safety concerns.  Understanding nuclear fission processes is crucial for both leveraging its energy potential and mitigating its risks.  We will now delve into the specifics of chain reaction dynamics and reactor design.
