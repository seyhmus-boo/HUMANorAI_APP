Quantum entanglement, a fundamentally non-classical phenomenon, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, exhibiting stronger-than-classical correlations in measurements of entangled particles.  Critically, the measurement outcome on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the outcome on the other, irrespective of distance, a feature seemingly violating the principle of locality.

This profound concept bridges multiple disciplines.  In physics, it underpins quantum computing, where entangled qubits enable massively parallel computation exceeding classical capabilities.  In quantum cryptography, entangled photons guarantee secure communication via quantum key distribution, exploiting the inherent unpredictability of measurement outcomes.  Philosophically, entanglement challenges our understanding of realism and locality, fueling debates on the nature of reality and information.  Furthermore,  entanglement finds applications in metrology, enhancing the precision of measurements beyond classical limits.  These interdisciplinary connections highlight entanglement's transformative potential across scientific and technological domains.
