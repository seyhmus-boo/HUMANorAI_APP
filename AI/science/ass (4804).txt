DNA replication, while seemingly straightforward conceptually, presents significant experimental challenges.  Accurately measuring the speed and fidelity of replication in vivo remains difficult, hampered by the complexity of the cellular environment and the dynamic nature of the process.  Techniques like single-molecule imaging offer insights but struggle with achieving both high temporal and spatial resolution across entire replication forks.  Further complicating analysis is the involvement of multiple proteins, whose precise roles and interactions remain areas of active research.  Determining the contribution of each protein to overall replication efficiency requires sophisticated genetic manipulations and careful biochemical assays, often facing issues with artefacts arising from perturbation of the intricate replication machinery.  Studying stalled replication forks and their subsequent repair processes introduces additional complexity, demanding highly sensitive methods to detect and characterize the resulting DNA lesions and the mechanisms that resolve them.  Finally, accurately modelling the stochasticity inherent in replication initiation and elongation remains computationally challenging, requiring extensive computational resources and sophisticated statistical approaches.  Overcoming these challenges is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of DNA replication and its implications in genome stability and disease.
