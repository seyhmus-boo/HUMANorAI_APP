The formation of black holes, enigmatic objects possessing gravitational fields so intense that not even light can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical groundwork, laid by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the late 18th century, posited the existence of "dark stars" â€“ objects so massive that their escape velocity exceeded the speed of light.  However, these early conceptions lacked the framework of general relativity, essential for a proper understanding of their nature.  Einstein's theory, published in 1915, provided the necessary mathematical foundation, demonstrating that sufficiently massive stars could collapse under their own gravity beyond the point of no return, forming a singularity hidden behind an event horizon.  The subsequent work of Oppenheimer and Snyder in the 1930s solidified the theoretical possibility of black hole formation through stellar collapse, though observational evidence remained elusive for decades.  Current understanding posits that stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars at the end of their life cycle, exceeding approximately three times the mass of the Sun.  Supermassive black holes, residing at the centers of most galaxies, are believed to form through a variety of mechanisms, including the accretion of matter and the mergers of smaller black holes, though their precise formation processes remain an area of active research.
