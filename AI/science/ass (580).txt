Quantum entanglement describes a peculiar correlation between two or more quantum particles, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation transcends classical physics, where separated objects possess independent properties.  Imagine two coins, magically linked: if one lands heads, the other *must* land tails, instantaneously, even if they're light-years apart. This isn't simply a matter of pre-determined outcomes; the coins don't have definite states until one is measured.  

Before measurement, the entangled pair exists in a superposition, a probabilistic blend of both heads/tails possibilities for each coin.  The act of measuring one coin – forcing it to "choose" heads or tails – instantaneously collapses the wave function, determining the state of the other, regardless of distance. This "spooky action at a distance," as Einstein termed it, implies a non-local connection between the particles. The information transfer seemingly exceeds the speed of light, although it doesn't permit faster-than-light communication as the outcome for each coin remains random until measurement.  The entanglement itself is the correlation, not a means of transmitting information in a causally paradoxical way.
