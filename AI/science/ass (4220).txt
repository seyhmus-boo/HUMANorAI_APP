Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, presents a profound challenge to classical intuition and a cornerstone of quantum information science. This presentation will offer an overview of the fundamental concepts underpinning entanglement, including its mathematical description via Bell states and the violation of Bell inequalities as experimental verification of its non-classical nature.  We will explore various methods for generating entangled states, such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion and trapped ion techniques, highlighting their strengths and limitations.  Further, the presentation will delve into the crucial role of entanglement in quantum technologies, focusing on its applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the ongoing research in understanding and harnessing the unique properties of entanglement for advancements in quantum metrology and fundamental tests of quantum mechanics, including the exploration of macroscopic entanglement and its implications.  The presentation aims to provide a comprehensive, yet accessible, introduction to this fascinating and rapidly developing field.
