Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus make them ideal for reinforcement in composite materials, a field witnessing recent advancements in scalable production techniques leading to improved dispersion and interfacial bonding.

Electrically, CNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials, depending on their chirality, offering potential for applications in nanoelectronics.  Recent research focuses on controlling chirality during synthesis to achieve precise electrical characteristics and developing novel device architectures like high-frequency transistors and transparent conductive films.

Thermally, CNTs exhibit remarkably high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of copper. This property is exploited in thermal management applications. Recent developments concentrate on fabricating CNT-based heat spreaders and interface materials for improved heat dissipation in electronics, notably with a focus on achieving controlled thermal transport across different interfaces within complex architectures.  Overall, ongoing research aims to refine synthesis, characterization, and functionalization techniques to fully exploit the remarkable potential of CNTs across diverse technological domains.
