DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring genetic fidelity across generations, is a tightly regulated and highly accurate mechanism.  This summary focuses on the key enzymatic players and underlying mechanisms.  Initiation involves the unwinding of the double helix at origins of replication by helicases, aided by single-strand binding proteins (SSBs) which prevent reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing the 3'-OH terminus required by DNA polymerase III, the primary replicative enzyme.  This polymerase synthesizes the leading strand continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase seals the phosphodiester backbone between Okazaki fragments, ensuring strand integrity.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading 3' to 5' exonuclease activity of DNA polymerases and various mismatch repair systems.  Prokaryotic and eukaryotic replication share core mechanisms, but differ in the complexity of their regulatory machinery and the presence of multiple origins of replication in eukaryotes.  Further research continues to unravel the intricate details of this crucial biological process, particularly regarding replication fork stability and the coordination of replication with other cellular processes.
