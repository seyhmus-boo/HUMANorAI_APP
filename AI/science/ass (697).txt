The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), including their high tensile strength, remarkable electrical conductivity, and unique thermal characteristics, have spurred extensive research. However, realizing the full potential of CNTs in technological applications faces significant experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains elusive, resulting in heterogeneous samples with variations in diameter, chirality, and structural defects.  These variations significantly impact their macroscopic properties, hindering reproducibility and reliable performance prediction.  Furthermore, characterizing the individual properties of CNTs within a bulk sample is difficult due to their nanoscale dimensions and tendency to aggregate.  Techniques like Raman spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy offer valuable insights, but remain limited in providing comprehensive, quantitative data across a large sample population.  Finally, processing and manipulating individual CNTs or well-defined assemblies for device fabrication presents a formidable hurdle.  Developing scalable and cost-effective methods for purification, dispersion, and controlled alignment of CNTs is crucial to overcome these challenges and unlock their technological promise.  Addressing these experimental complexities is paramount for translating the extraordinary potential of CNTs into practical applications.
