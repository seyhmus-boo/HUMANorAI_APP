DNA replication, the semiconservative process by which genetic material is duplicated, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding stemmed from the seminal work of Meselson and Stahl (1958), who definitively demonstrated the semiconservative mechanism using density gradient centrifugation, rejecting the conservative and dispersive models.  This built upon Chargaff's rules and Watson and Crick's double helix model, providing a structural basis for the process.

Replication initiates at specific origins of replication, unwinding the double helix via helicases and stabilizing the separated strands with single-strand binding proteins.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to add deoxynucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, forming Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers, and DNA ligase joins the fragments.  Telomerase addresses the replication problem at chromosome ends.

The remarkable fidelity of DNA replication is maintained through proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and various repair mechanisms, minimizing errors and preserving genomic integrity.  Dysregulation of these processes can lead to mutations, contributing to various diseases and driving evolutionary change.
