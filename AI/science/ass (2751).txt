Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics, describes a strong correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  Initially posited by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in 1935 as a paradox highlighting the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, entanglement has since been experimentally verified numerous times.  The EPR paradox argued that the instantaneous correlation implied by entanglement violated locality, a principle central to classical physics.  However, Bell's theorem (1964) provided a means to experimentally distinguish between quantum mechanics and local realistic theories, demonstrating that entanglement violates Bell inequalities.  Subsequent experiments, using increasingly sophisticated techniques such as photon polarization and trapped ions, have consistently confirmed the predictions of quantum mechanics, solidifying the reality of entanglement.  This non-classical correlation holds profound implications for various fields, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum metrology, where entangled states offer significant advantages over classical approaches.  Ongoing research continues to explore the fundamental nature of entanglement and its potential for technological advancement.
