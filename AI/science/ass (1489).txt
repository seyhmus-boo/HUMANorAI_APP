Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition.  Imagine two coins, flipped simultaneously but hidden in separate boxes.  In the classical world, each coin is independently heads or tails.  Entanglement, however, is like having these coins magically linked.  If we open one box and find heads, we *instantly* know the other is tails, regardless of the distance separating the boxes.  This isn't merely pre-determined; the coins' states are undefined until measured.

The crucial difference lies in the quantum realm's superposition.  Before measurement, the entangled particles exist in a combined state, not individually defined.  This linked state isn't simply a correlation; the particles' fates are intrinsically interwoven.  Measuring one collapses the superposition, instantly determining the state of its entangled partner, even across vast distances. This instantaneous correlation doesn't violate causality, as no information is transmitted faster than light, but it underscores the non-local nature of quantum mechanics, prompting ongoing debate and research.
