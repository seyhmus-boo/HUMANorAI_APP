Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the mechanisms of photosynthesis, a process vital to almost all life on Earth.  Early understanding, dating back to the 17th century with van Helmont's willow tree experiment, hinted at plants utilizing water and air.  However, it was not until the 19th century that crucial advancements were made.  Ingenhousz demonstrated the light dependence of this process, while Sachs later confirmed the production of starch as a photosynthetic product.

The modern understanding of photosynthesis involves two main stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  In the light-dependent reactions, light energy excites chlorophyll molecules within photosystems II and I, driving electron transport chains that generate ATP and NADPH. This energy is then used in the Calvin cycle to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic molecules, predominantly glucose.  Different photosynthetic pathways, such as C4 and CAM, have evolved to optimize CO2 fixation in various environmental conditions.  Further research continues to refine our comprehension of the intricate enzymatic processes and regulatory mechanisms involved in this fundamental biological process.
