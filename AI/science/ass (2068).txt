Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles.  The process initiates when a neutron interacts with the target nucleus, typically via the strong nuclear force, a short-range interaction described by quantum chromodynamics.  The neutron's absorption elevates the nucleus to a highly excited quantum state, exceeding the binding energy of the system.  This excited state is not a stationary state and its wavefunction represents a superposition of numerous configurations, including configurations with significantly distorted nuclear shapes.  Tunneling, a quintessential quantum phenomenon, allows the nucleus to overcome the Coulomb barrier, despite the repulsive electrostatic forces between protons.  The subsequent fission proceeds along multiple pathways, leading to a range of fission fragment masses and associated kinetic energies.  The probability of specific fission channels is determined by the quantum mechanical transition probabilities between the initial excited state and various final states, influencing the fission fragment mass distribution.  The emitted neutrons, contributing to chain reactions, also originate from quantum mechanical transitions within the daughter nuclei, their energies and numbers dictated by the available nuclear energy levels and transition probabilities.  Therefore, a complete understanding of nuclear fission necessitates a detailed quantum mechanical treatment of nuclear structure and dynamics.
