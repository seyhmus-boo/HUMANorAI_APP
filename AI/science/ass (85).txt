Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for diverse applications spanning electronics, materials science, and medicine.  However, realizing the full potential of CNTs remains hampered by significant experimental challenges. This research paper examines the key hurdles encountered in characterizing and manipulating CNTs, focusing on the complexities inherent in their synthesis, purification, and precise structural control.  The inherent heterogeneity of CNT samples, encompassing variations in diameter, length, chirality, and the presence of defects, presents a major obstacle to achieving reliable and reproducible experimental data.  Furthermore, the strong van der Waals forces between individual nanotubes lead to aggregation, complicating dispersion and hindering the effective investigation of their individual properties.  This aggregation further complicates accurate characterization techniques, such as electron microscopy and spectroscopy, impacting the ability to definitively correlate structure with properties.  This paper will analyze these experimental challenges, discuss current mitigation strategies, and highlight the need for improved methodologies to unlock the full potential of CNTs for advanced technological applications.
