Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit a unique confluence of properties that underpin their diverse applications across multiple scientific disciplines.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from the strong covalent bonds within the graphitic lattice, surpasses that of steel, making them attractive for materials science in applications like reinforced composites.  Simultaneously, their electrical conductivity, which can be either metallic or semiconducting depending on chirality, is crucial for electronics and nanotechnology, facilitating the development of novel transistors and sensors.  Furthermore, the high aspect ratio and large surface area of CNTs are exploited in chemistry and environmental science, enabling their use as catalysts, adsorbents for pollutants, and in drug delivery systems.  The exceptional thermal conductivity of CNTs also plays a significant role in thermal management applications, bridging the gap between materials science and engineering. Finally, the optical properties, exhibiting strong near-infrared absorption and photoluminescence, are being explored in biomedicine for imaging and therapeutic applications, highlighting the interdisciplinary nature of CNT research and its potential to revolutionize various fields.
