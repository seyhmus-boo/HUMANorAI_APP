Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential across diverse technological applications.  However, realizing this potential is significantly hampered by persistent experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains elusive, often yielding heterogeneous mixtures of differing chirality, diameter, and length, hindering reproducible characterization and consistent performance.  Furthermore, the strong van der Waals forces between individual CNTs lead to bundling, limiting their effective surface area and impacting their dispersibility in various matrices.  This necessitates sophisticated functionalization techniques, which themselves can compromise the intrinsic properties of the nanotubes.  Accurate and reliable characterization poses another hurdle; techniques like Raman spectroscopy and electron microscopy, while informative, often require advanced expertise and may not provide a complete picture of CNT structure and purity.  Finally, large-scale, cost-effective production of high-quality, well-defined CNTs remains a major obstacle to their widespread adoption, limiting their viability for industrial applications. Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for unlocking the full potential of CNTs.
