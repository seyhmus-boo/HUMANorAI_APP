DNA replication, the process by which a double-stranded DNA molecule produces two identical copies, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding emerged from the Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment (1944), which identified DNA as the hereditary material, paving the way for subsequent investigations.  The seminal work of Watson and Crick (1953), elucidating the double helix structure, provided the structural basis for proposing a semi-conservative replication mechanism.

This model, later experimentally verified by Meselson and Stahl (1958), postulates that each strand serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.  The process initiates at specific sites, origins of replication, where the double helix unwinds, creating replication forks.  DNA polymerases, key enzymes, add nucleotides to the growing strand in a 5' to 3' direction, utilizing the existing strand as a template.  Leading and lagging strands are synthesized concurrently, with the latter involving Okazaki fragments and ligase activity to join them.  High fidelity is ensured by proofreading mechanisms within DNA polymerases, minimizing errors during replication.  The precise and controlled nature of DNA replication ensures accurate inheritance of genetic information across generations.
