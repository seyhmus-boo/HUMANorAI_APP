The formation of black holes, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon nuclear physics, general relativity, and observational astronomy.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (≥20 solar masses).  When nuclear fusion ceases in the stellar core, the inward gravitational pressure overcomes outward degeneracy pressure, leading to a catastrophic implosion.  The core's density surpasses the critical density predicted by general relativity, forming a singularity.  This process, understood through sophisticated numerical simulations leveraging both general relativity and equations of state from nuclear physics, results in a spacetime region with an event horizon, beyond which even light cannot escape.  Observational confirmation comes from X-ray astronomy, detecting the accretion disks around black holes, and from gravitational wave astronomy, registering the mergers of binary black holes – a triumph of interdisciplinary collaboration validating theoretical predictions.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, remain less fully understood, potentially forming via direct collapse scenarios or through the merging of stellar-mass black holes, further highlighting the intricate connections between diverse fields in unraveling these cosmic enigmas.
