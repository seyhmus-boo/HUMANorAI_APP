Chemical bonding and molecular structure lie at the heart of chemistry, dictating the properties and reactivity of all matter.  Understanding the forces that hold atoms together, and the resulting three-dimensional arrangements, remains a central challenge with profound implications across numerous scientific disciplines.  While classical valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory provide foundational frameworks, recent advancements have significantly refined our understanding and predictive capabilities.  This paper explores these key developments, focusing on the increasingly sophisticated computational methods enabling accurate predictions of molecular geometries and energetics.  Specifically, we examine the impact of density functional theory (DFT) advancements, particularly in the development of hybrid functionals and range-separated methods, which offer improved accuracy for a wider range of systems compared to earlier approximations.  Furthermore, we will discuss progress in characterizing weak intermolecular interactions, crucial for understanding biological systems and materials science, including the application of advanced wavefunction methods and the development of accurate potential energy surfaces. Finally, we will touch upon the growing importance of machine learning in accelerating the prediction and analysis of molecular properties, offering a glimpse into the future direction of the field.
