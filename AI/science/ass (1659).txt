Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems that exists even when spatially separated. This correlation transcends classical physics, exhibiting non-local correlations that violate Bell's inequalities.  Entangled particles share a combined quantum state, such that the measurement outcome of one particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them. This instantaneous correlation does not allow for faster-than-light communication, as the measurement outcomes themselves are random and unpredictable.  The nature of entanglement is a subject of ongoing debate and research, with implications for quantum information science.  Entanglement is a crucial resource for quantum computing, enabling the realization of quantum algorithms that surpass the capabilities of classical computers.  Furthermore, its application extends to quantum cryptography, providing secure communication channels based on the principle of entanglement-based quantum key distribution.  The precise understanding and control of entanglement remain key challenges, requiring further investigation into decoherence mechanisms and the development of robust entanglement generation and manipulation techniques.
