Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into smaller nuclei.  Imagine a carefully balanced stack of dominoes; each domino represents a nucleon (proton or neutron) within the nucleus.  These nucleons are bound together by the strong nuclear force, analogous to the gravitational forces holding the dominoes upright.  However, this force is relatively short-ranged.  Introducing a neutron (like nudging a domino at the edge) disrupts the delicate balance.  This triggers a chain reaction: the initially unstable nucleus fissions, releasing a significant amount of energy – the potential energy stored in the "domino stack" is suddenly released – along with more neutrons. These released neutrons then act as further nudges, initiating fission in neighboring nuclei, creating a cascading effect.  The energy released manifests as kinetic energy of the fission fragments (the broken pieces of the "domino stack") and as gamma radiation (the vibrations from the impact). Control over this chain reaction, essential for nuclear power generation, involves carefully managing the "nudges" to avoid an uncontrolled cascade, analogous to controlling the toppling of the dominoes.
