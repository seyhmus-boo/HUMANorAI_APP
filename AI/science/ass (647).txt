This presentation explores the implications of quantum mechanics on the fidelity and efficiency of DNA replication, a process traditionally viewed through a classical lens.  While the overall process is governed by classical biochemistry, we propose that subtle quantum phenomena may play a significant, albeit currently underappreciated, role.  We will focus on two key areas:  Firstly, we will discuss the potential influence of quantum tunneling on the accuracy of base pairing during replication.  The possibility of proton tunneling facilitating tautomeric shifts, leading to mismatches, will be examined, along with recent experimental and theoretical work exploring this hypothesis. Secondly, the role of quantum coherence in enzyme function will be considered.  Specifically, we will investigate whether quantum effects within the active sites of DNA polymerases might contribute to their remarkable speed and accuracy.  This presentation will review the existing literature and propose avenues for future research, including the application of advanced computational methods and potentially novel experimental designs to probe the quantum nature of DNA replication. Ultimately, a deeper understanding of these quantum effects may reveal new strategies for therapeutic intervention and advancements in biotechnology.
