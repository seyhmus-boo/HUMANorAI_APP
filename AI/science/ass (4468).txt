CRISPR-Cas systems, derived from bacterial adaptive immune mechanisms, have revolutionized genetic engineering.  This presentation will explore the history and impact of CRISPR technology, tracing its evolution from its initial discovery as a naturally occurring defense system in prokaryotes to its current status as a precise and versatile gene editing tool.  Early research elucidated the mechanism of CRISPR-mediated viral DNA targeting and cleavage, paving the way for its adaptation in diverse organisms.  We will discuss key milestones, including the identification of Cas9 as a programmable nuclease and the subsequent development of simplified RNA-guided systems.  The presentation will highlight the remarkable versatility of CRISPR, encompassing gene knockout, knock-in, base editing, and epigenetic modifications.  Furthermore, we will examine the broad applications of CRISPR across diverse fields, ranging from fundamental biological research and disease modeling to therapeutic gene correction and agricultural improvement.  Finally, we will briefly address the ethical considerations and ongoing challenges associated with this powerful technology, focusing on off-target effects and responsible innovation.
