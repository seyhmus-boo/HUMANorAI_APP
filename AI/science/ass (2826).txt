Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, is a process underpinned by the strong and weak nuclear forces, resulting in a significant release of energy.  This energy release stems from the mass defect, a difference in mass between the initial nucleus and the resultant fragments, converted into kinetic energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  The process typically initiates via neutron bombardment, inducing instability within the target nucleus.  Subsequently, the unstable nucleus undergoes fission, liberating further neutrons which can initiate a chain reaction, provided the critical mass of fissile material is exceeded.  The exact fission fragments produced exhibit a statistical distribution, varying in mass and isotopic composition, dependent upon the target nucleus and incident neutron energy.  Neutron multiplicity, a crucial parameter influencing the chain reaction's rate, varies with the fissioning isotope.  Efficient utilization of nuclear fission in reactors relies on careful control of this chain reaction, achieved through neutron moderation and absorption techniques, ensuring sustained energy production without uncontrolled escalation. The specific isotopes utilized, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, possess favorable fission cross-sections, contributing to their suitability for nuclear power generation.
