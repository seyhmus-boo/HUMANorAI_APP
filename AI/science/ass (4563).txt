Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on catalysts in organic chemistry.  Catalysts are substances that dramatically accelerate reaction rates without being consumed themselves.  Think of them as matchmakers in the bustling marketplace of molecules.  Reactants, our potential partners, might possess the inherent capability to react, but the activation energy – the initial push required – is too high. The catalyst, our matchmaker, lowers this activation energy, enabling the reaction to proceed swiftly and efficiently.

This is achieved through the formation of intermediate complexes.  Imagine reactants as hesitant individuals, reluctant to engage. The catalyst acts as a bridge, forming temporary bonds with each reactant, bringing them into close proximity and in the correct orientation for reaction. Once the reaction occurs, the catalyst detaches, unscathed and ready to facilitate further interactions.  

Crucially, catalysts do not alter the overall thermodynamics of the reaction; they only affect the kinetics.  The equilibrium position remains unchanged – the matchmaker doesn't decide which couple forms, only how quickly they find each other.  Therefore, understanding catalytic processes is paramount for efficient and sustainable organic synthesis.
