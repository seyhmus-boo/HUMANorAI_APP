Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile strength exceeding that of steel, arises from the strong covalent bonds within the graphitic structure.  High aspect ratios contribute to their exceptional stiffness and flexibility.  

Electrically, CNTs display intriguing dualism. Single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) can be metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality, i.e., the helical arrangement of the carbon atoms.  This property is crucial for their potential in nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper, enabling efficient heat dissipation. Their large surface area allows for significant adsorption capacity, making them valuable in applications like gas storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in controlling chirality during synthesis and achieving scalable, cost-effective production for widespread implementation.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these limitations and harnessing the full potential of CNTs in diverse fields.
