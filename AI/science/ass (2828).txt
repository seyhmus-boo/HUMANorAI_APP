Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is a process underpinned by the strong and electromagnetic forces.  This lecture examines the mechanism, focusing on the crucial role of neutron bombardment in initiating the reaction.  Specifically, the absorption of a neutron by a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235, destabilizes the nucleus, leading to its fission. This fission event releases a significant amount of energy, primarily through the conversion of mass into energy as described by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  Furthermore, the process yields additional neutrons, which, under specific conditions of critical mass and geometry, can trigger a chain reaction, sustaining the fission process.  We will explore the various fission products, their radioactive nature, and the associated challenges in nuclear waste management.  Finally, the lecture will briefly touch upon the controlled and uncontrolled release of energy in fission reactors and nuclear weapons, respectively, highlighting the critical importance of reactor design and safety protocols.
