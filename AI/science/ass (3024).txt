Good morning. Today's lecture examines chemical bonding and molecular structure, highlighting its crucial interdisciplinary nature.  Understanding how atoms bond – through ionic, covalent, or metallic interactions – is fundamental to predicting molecular properties and reactivity. This knowledge underpins diverse fields.  In materials science, for example, the precise arrangement of atoms dictates a material's strength, conductivity, and other physical characteristics.  Similarly, in biology, the intricate three-dimensional structures of proteins, determined by covalent and non-covalent bonds, directly influence their biological function.  Furthermore, in pharmacology, understanding molecular structure is paramount for designing drugs that specifically target particular receptor sites through precise intermolecular interactions.  Computational chemistry provides crucial modelling tools to predict and analyze these structures and interactions, linking chemistry with computer science and mathematics.  In essence, a deep understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure forms the cornerstone of progress across numerous scientific disciplines.
