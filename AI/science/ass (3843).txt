Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, operates through two primary mechanisms: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The light-dependent reactions can be likened to a water pump powered by sunlight.  Light energy excites electrons in chlorophyll, analogous to the pump's engine receiving power. This energized electron flow drives the creation of ATP and NADPH, representing the pumped water – high-energy molecules essential for subsequent processes.  Oxygen, a byproduct, is released like excess water expelled from the pump.

The light-independent reactions, in contrast, resemble a factory assembly line.  The ATP and NADPH (the pumped water) provide the energy to drive the fixation of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). CO2 enters the cycle, much like raw materials entering a factory. Through a series of enzyme-catalysed reactions, representing the assembly line, CO2 is converted into glucose, the final product – analogous to the finished goods leaving the factory. This glucose stores the chemical energy initially captured from sunlight, providing the plant with the necessary building blocks for growth and metabolic processes. The cycle continuously operates, fueled by the energy generated in the light-dependent reactions.
