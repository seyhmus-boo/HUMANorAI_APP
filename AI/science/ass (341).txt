Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon predicted by early quantum mechanics and experimentally verified since the mid-20th century, describes a strong correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical physics, where systems are independent once separated.  Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen famously highlighted the paradoxical nature of entanglement in their 1935 EPR paper, arguing it implied incompleteness in quantum mechanics.  Bell's theorem (1964) provided a crucial framework for experimentally testing the predictions of quantum mechanics against local realism, a cornerstone of classical physics.  Subsequent experiments, beginning with Alain Aspect's work in the 1980s, overwhelmingly confirmed quantum mechanical predictions, demonstrating the violation of Bell inequalities and solidifying the reality of entanglement.  Entanglement has since become a cornerstone of quantum information science, underpinning technologies such as quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing.  Further research continues to explore the fundamental implications of entanglement, including its role in understanding the foundations of quantum mechanics and its potential applications in novel technologies.  Open questions remain regarding the limits of entanglement and its potential connections to gravitational phenomena.
