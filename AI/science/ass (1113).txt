This presentation explores the unique properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) through the lens of quantum mechanics.  We will examine how the CNT's sp²-hybridized carbon atoms and their cylindrical structure dictate its electronic and mechanical characteristics.  Specifically, we will focus on the quantum confinement effect, demonstrating how the nanotube diameter and chirality profoundly influence its band structure, leading to either metallic or semiconducting behavior.  This is directly related to the quantization of the electron wavefunction within the limited dimensionality of the CNT.  Furthermore, we will discuss the implications of this quantum mechanical description for the exceptional mechanical strength and elasticity exhibited by CNTs, highlighting the role of strong covalent bonding and π-electron delocalization.  The presentation will conclude with a brief overview of ongoing research focusing on manipulating the quantum properties of CNTs for applications in advanced materials science, including nanoelectronics and energy storage, emphasizing the interplay between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.
