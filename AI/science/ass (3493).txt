Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the distance separating them, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics.  Its origins trace back to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox (1935), which challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics by highlighting the seemingly paradoxical nature of entangled states.  EPR argued that quantum mechanics' description of entangled particles implied faster-than-light communication, violating principles of relativity.

However, subsequent experimental work, culminating in the Bell inequality experiments (starting in the 1970s), decisively refuted the EPR arguments, confirming the reality of entanglement.  These experiments demonstrated that entangled particles exhibit correlations exceeding those possible within classical physics, solidifying entanglement as a genuine and counterintuitive quantum effect.  The implications of entanglement are profound, extending beyond foundational questions in physics to practical applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation, where entangled particles serve as a crucial resource for information processing and transmission.  Despite its established existence, the complete theoretical understanding of entanglement and its implications continue to be a topic of active research.
