Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties rendering them promising candidates for a diverse range of applications.  This presentation will explore the key physical and chemical characteristics defining CNT behaviour.  We will examine the influence of chirality and diameter on electronic properties, encompassing the transition from metallic to semiconducting behaviour.  The exceptional mechanical strength and high aspect ratio of CNTs, significantly exceeding that of steel, will be discussed, alongside their unique thermal conductivity.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and functionalization, highlighting the importance of controlling these factors to optimize desired properties.  Finally, we will briefly survey emerging applications leveraging these remarkable properties, including advanced composites, energy storage devices, and nanoelectronics.  The presentation aims to provide a concise overview of the fundamental properties of CNTs and their potential impact across diverse scientific and technological fields.
