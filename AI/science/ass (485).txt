Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in stellar evolution, dictated by the interplay of gravity and pressure.  Massive stars, exceeding approximately 20 solar masses, exhaust their nuclear fuel, ceasing the outward pressure that counteracts gravitational collapse.  This initiates a runaway process: the core implodes, exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit and potentially triggering a supernova explosion.  The remnant core, deprived of internal pressure support, continues its collapse under its immense self-gravity, eventually surpassing the Schwarzschild radius.  Beyond this radius, the escape velocity exceeds the speed of light, forming an event horizon and defining a black hole.  Variations in the initial stellar mass and angular momentum influence the black hole's properties, generating a spectrum of masses and spins.  Furthermore, supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, are hypothesized to form through accretion of stellar-mass black holes and direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe, mechanisms still under active investigation.  The detailed physics of this catastrophic collapse remains a significant area of both theoretical and observational research.
