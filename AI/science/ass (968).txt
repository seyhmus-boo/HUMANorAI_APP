Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a class of cylindrical carbon allotropes with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.  Their structure, consisting of seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets, yields unique characteristics depending on their diameter, chirality (helicity), and number of layers (single-walled, SWCNTs; multi-walled, MWCNTs).  SWCNTs exhibit remarkable tensile strength exceeding that of steel, while their electrical conductivity varies from metallic to semiconducting based on chirality, offering potential for nanoelectronics.  MWCNTs, possessing higher structural robustness, find applications in composite materials enhancement.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit exceptional thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper, making them promising for heat dissipation applications.  However, challenges remain, including the control of chirality during synthesis, effective dispersion in matrices, and potential toxicological concerns.  Ongoing research focuses on scalable, cost-effective production methods and applications in diverse fields, such as energy storage, sensors, and biomedical engineering, driven by their remarkable and tunable properties.
