This presentation provides an overview of key plasma physics phenomena, focusing on their diverse applications and ongoing research challenges. We will begin by introducing fundamental plasma properties, including Debye shielding and plasma oscillations, establishing a foundation for understanding more complex behaviours.  The presentation will then delve into macroscopic phenomena such as magnetic confinement and wave propagation in plasmas, highlighting their importance in fusion energy research and space physics.  Specific examples will include the intricacies of magnetohydrodynamic instabilities in tokamaks and the generation of auroral emissions in the Earth's ionosphere. We will also discuss micro-scale phenomena, such as collisionless shocks and Landau damping, which are crucial for understanding particle acceleration and energy transport in astrophysical plasmas.  Finally, the presentation will briefly address emerging research areas, such as laboratory astrophysics and the development of novel plasma-based technologies, emphasizing the interdisciplinary nature of the field and its potential for technological advancement. The presentation aims to provide both a comprehensive introduction and a glimpse into the exciting frontier of ongoing research in plasma physics.
