Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon wherein two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a source of ongoing fascination and intense research.  Initially a paradoxical concept challenging classical intuitions of locality and realism, entanglement has transitioned from a theoretical curiosity to a powerful resource with significant technological implications.  This paper explores recent advancements in understanding and harnessing this unique quantum property.  Recent years have witnessed breakthroughs in the generation and manipulation of entangled states, particularly with the development of scalable platforms like trapped ions, superconducting circuits, and photonic systems.  These advancements allow for the creation of increasingly complex entangled states involving a larger number of qubits, paving the way for the realization of quantum technologies such as quantum computing and quantum communication.  Furthermore,  novel theoretical frameworks are emerging, refining our understanding of entanglement beyond bipartite systems, exploring its multifaceted nature in multipartite settings and investigating its potential role in resolving fundamental questions in quantum gravity. This review will examine these recent developments, highlighting their impact on both fundamental physics and the burgeoning field of quantum technologies.
