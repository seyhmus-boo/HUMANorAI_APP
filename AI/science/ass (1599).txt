Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that make them promising candidates for a wide range of applications.  This presentation will explore the key properties of CNTs, focusing on their remarkable strength and stiffness stemming from their sp² hybridized carbon structure,  their high aspect ratio, and the influence of chirality on their electronic behavior – ranging from metallic to semiconducting.  We will discuss the superior thermal conductivity of CNTs, enabling efficient heat dissipation, and their exceptional electrical conductivity, facilitating high-current applications.  Furthermore, the large surface area of CNTs offers significant potential for applications in energy storage, catalysis, and sensing.  The presentation will examine the challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and processing, alongside advancements in controlling their properties for specific applications.  Finally, we will highlight current and prospective practical applications of CNTs, including reinforced composites, flexible electronics, energy storage devices (batteries and supercapacitors), and advanced filtration systems, emphasizing the ongoing research and development efforts aimed at realizing their full potential.
