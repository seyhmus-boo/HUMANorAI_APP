Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, exhibit behaviours deeply rooted in their quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp²-hybridized carbon atoms form a seamless cylindrical lattice, resulting in a π-electron system delocalized along the tube's circumference.  This delocalization is crucial in determining their electronic properties, which are highly sensitive to chirality – the helical arrangement of the hexagonal lattice.  Armchair nanotubes display metallic conductivity due to a zero band gap, stemming from specific symmetry-related energy level crossings at the Fermi level.  Zigzag and chiral nanotubes, conversely, exhibit semiconducting behaviour with a band gap dependent on their diameter and chiral angle, a direct consequence of quantum confinement effects within the nanoscale structure.  The strong σ-bonding framework contributes to exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, while phonon dispersion relations, governed by the lattice vibrations, determine their superior thermal conductivity.  Furthermore, quantum mechanical calculations are essential for predicting and understanding CNT functionalization, where interactions with adatoms or molecules significantly alter their electronic and chemical properties, leading to applications in diverse fields like nanoelectronics and sensing.
