Black hole formation remains a cornerstone of astrophysics, demanding sophisticated theoretical models and observational scrutiny. This presentation will review the current understanding of this process, focusing on recent advancements.  We will explore the two primary pathways: stellar-mass black hole formation through core-collapse supernovae and the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at the centers of galaxies.  Recent high-resolution simulations have shed light on the complex interplay of rotation, magnetic fields, and neutrino emission during stellar collapse, revealing a diverse range of outcomes impacting black hole mass and spin.  Furthermore, we will discuss the evolving understanding of SMBH seeds, examining the viability of direct collapse scenarios versus the growth from stellar-mass black holes through mergers and accretion.  New observational data from gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo are providing crucial constraints on the properties of merging stellar-mass black holes, informing our models of their progenitor systems.  Finally, we will address open questions surrounding the formation of intermediate-mass black holes and the role of black hole formation in galaxy evolution, highlighting avenues for future research using multi-messenger astronomy.
