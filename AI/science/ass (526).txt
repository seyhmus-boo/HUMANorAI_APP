This review summarizes current understanding of black hole formation in astrophysics.  The primary mechanisms, stellar collapse and galactic mergers, are examined, highlighting recent advancements and outstanding challenges.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit, a process significantly influenced by stellar rotation and magnetic fields.  However, detailed modeling of the final collapse remains computationally intensive and dependent on poorly constrained input parameters, leading to uncertainties in mass and spin predictions.  Supermassive black holes, inhabiting galactic centers, are thought to form via both direct collapse of massive gas clouds in early epochs and accretion from seed black holes formed via stellar collapse or other pathways. The hierarchical merging of galaxies plays a crucial role in the growth and evolution of these behemoths, with gravitational wave observations providing invaluable observational constraints.  Significant uncertainties remain regarding the seeding mechanisms and the efficiency of accretion processes across various cosmological epochs.  Future research should focus on refining hydrodynamic simulations, incorporating more realistic astrophysical environments, and improving observational constraints on black hole masses, spins, and their environments to further unravel the complexities of black hole formation.
