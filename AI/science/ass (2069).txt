Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient method for genome editing.  Their relative simplicity and versatility compared to previous techniques have propelled their widespread adoption across diverse biological fields, from fundamental research to therapeutic applications.  However, despite the significant advancements, the implementation of CRISPR technology remains fraught with experimental challenges that hinder its full potential.  This paper focuses on the key limitations currently encountered in utilizing CRISPR-Cas systems. We will explore the challenges associated with off-target effects, which encompass unintended modifications at genomic loci distinct from the intended target site, and discuss strategies to mitigate these undesirable outcomes.  Furthermore, the difficulties in achieving efficient gene editing across diverse cell types and organisms will be analyzed, including considerations of delivery methods and cellular factors influencing CRISPR efficacy.  Finally, we will address the ethical implications arising from the power and accessibility of this technology, highlighting the necessity for careful consideration of responsible research practices and regulatory frameworks to ensure safe and beneficial applications.
