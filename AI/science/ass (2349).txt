This presentation addresses experimental challenges encountered in the determination and understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure.  While theoretical advancements have significantly enhanced our ability to model and predict these properties, experimental verification remains crucial.  We will highlight key challenges, focusing on limitations inherent to different spectroscopic techniques.  Difficulties in resolving fine structural details, particularly in large or complex molecules, will be discussed, including limitations in resolution and signal-to-noise ratios. The impact of matrix effects and sample preparation on the accuracy and reliability of experimental data will also be examined. Furthermore, the presentation will address the challenges associated with studying transient species and reactive intermediates, emphasizing the need for advanced time-resolved techniques and specialized experimental setups.  Finally, we will briefly explore emerging experimental approaches aimed at overcoming these limitations, such as advanced laser spectroscopy and cryogenic techniques, and discuss the potential for synergistic approaches combining experimental and computational methodologies to refine our understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure.
