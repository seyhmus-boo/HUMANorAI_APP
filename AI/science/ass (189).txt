Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the distance separating them, presents both fundamental challenges and exciting technological opportunities. This presentation will provide a concise overview of the principles underpinning entanglement, focusing on the violation of Bell's inequalities and its implications for local realism.  We will discuss different methods for generating entangled states, including spontaneous parametric down-conversion and trapped ion techniques.  Beyond its theoretical significance, entanglement forms the bedrock of several emerging quantum technologies.  We will explore practical applications currently under development, such as quantum key distribution (QKD) offering unconditionally secure communication, and its potential role in enhancing quantum computing power through techniques like quantum teleportation.  Further, we will touch upon the application of entangled photons in quantum metrology, enabling significantly improved precision in measurement.  Finally, the presentation will briefly address the ongoing challenges and future prospects of harnessing the full potential of this remarkable quantum phenomenon.
