Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon with profound implications for our understanding of reality.  Initially predicted by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen in their 1935 EPR paradox, entanglement describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation is non-classical;  measuring the state of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the state of its entangled partner, even if light years apart.  This seemingly instantaneous interaction challenged the principle of locality, a cornerstone of classical physics.

Experimental verification of entanglement, beginning in the latter half of the 20th century, confirmed the EPR predictions, albeit in a manner that vindicated quantum mechanics rather than disproving it.  Bell's theorem, formulated in the 1960s, provided a crucial framework for experimentally distinguishing between classical and quantum correlations, definitively demonstrating the existence of entanglement.  The implications of entanglement are far-reaching, extending to quantum computing, cryptography, and our fundamental understanding of the nature of reality and information.  We will now delve into the mechanics underpinning this remarkable phenomenon.
