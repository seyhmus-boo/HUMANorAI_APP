Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are inextricably intertwined, regardless of spatial separation. This correlation surpasses classical correlations, exhibiting non-local correlations that violate Bell's inequalities.  Entanglement arises from the superposition principle, where a composite system exists in a superposition of entangled states, not a statistical mixture of separable states.  These entangled states are described by a joint wave function that cannot be factored into individual wave functions for each subsystem. Measurement of a property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the outcome of a corresponding measurement on the other, even across vast distances, highlighting the non-local nature of quantum mechanics.  This seemingly paradoxical behavior has been experimentally verified numerous times, with implications for quantum information science, including quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation.  Further research into the fundamental nature of entanglement and its exploitation for technological advancements remains a vibrant area of investigation.  Understanding entanglement is crucial for developing a complete and consistent interpretation of quantum theory.
