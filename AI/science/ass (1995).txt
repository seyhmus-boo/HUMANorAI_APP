Black hole formation represents a crucial stage in stellar and galactic evolution, driven by gravitational collapse.  This abstract summarizes the primary mechanisms and observational evidence supporting the existence of stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the core collapse of massive stars (≳20 M⊙) at the end of their nuclear fusion lifecycle, following supernova explosions.  The precise details of this process, including the role of progenitor star rotation and magnetic fields, remain active areas of research, with numerical simulations providing increasingly sophisticated models.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, present a more enigmatic origin.  While direct collapse of massive gas clouds is proposed, the accretion of stellar-mass black holes or mergers of smaller black holes offer alternative scenarios.  Gravitational wave observations from merging black holes, coupled with electromagnetic counterparts, offer powerful probes of the formation and evolution of both stellar-mass and potentially supermassive black holes.  Ongoing and future observational campaigns, including high-resolution imaging and multi-messenger astronomy, will be crucial in refining our understanding of black hole formation across the cosmic mass scale and clarifying the interplay between black holes and their host galaxies.
