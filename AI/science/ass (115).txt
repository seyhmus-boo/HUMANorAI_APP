Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have spurred intense interdisciplinary research.  Their remarkable tensile strength and high Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel, are exploited in materials science for reinforcing composites and developing advanced nano-devices.  Their unique electronic structure, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality,  is leveraged in electronics for field-effect transistors, sensors, and flexible displays.  Furthermore, their high surface area and tunable chemical reactivity are being explored in chemistry and catalysis for applications such as gas storage, drug delivery, and heterogeneous catalysis.  The biocompatibility of certain CNT functionalizations opens avenues in biomedicine for targeted therapies and biosensing.  However, challenges remain regarding scalable production, purification, and long-term biocompatibility, necessitating further interdisciplinary collaboration involving materials scientists, chemists, physicists, engineers, and biologists to fully realize the potential of CNTs across diverse technological domains.  Ongoing research focusing on controlling CNT synthesis, surface functionalization, and dispersion techniques are crucial to overcome these limitations and translate their unique properties into practical applications.
