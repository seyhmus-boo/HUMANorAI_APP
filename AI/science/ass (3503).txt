Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing unique electronic and mechanical properties, are subject to intense scrutiny from a quantum mechanical perspective.  Their sp² hybridized carbon lattice, arranged in cylindrical configurations, results in a rich electronic structure highly sensitive to diameter, chirality, and structural defects.  Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that armchair CNTs exhibit metallic behavior due to their unique band structure, characterized by a zero band gap, while zigzag and chiral CNTs can display semiconducting characteristics with band gaps inversely proportional to their diameter.  Quantum transport simulations unveil ballistic electron transport at low temperatures, reflecting the nearly defect-free nature of high-quality CNTs and enabling high current densities.  However, quantum mechanical effects like electron-phonon interactions and edge state effects influence charge transport at higher temperatures and in the presence of defects.  Furthermore, the strong σ and π bonding, analyzed using tight-binding approximations and molecular dynamics, accounts for their exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness.  Understanding these quantum mechanical underpinnings is crucial for harnessing the full potential of CNTs in advanced nanotechnological applications, including electronics, composites, and energy storage.
