Nuclear fission is the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus, such as uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy.  Imagine a delicately balanced, highly charged bowling ball representing the nucleus.  This ball is held together by the strong nuclear force, analogous to the internal bonds within a tightly packed group of people.  However, if this bowling ball is struck by a neutron – a tiny marble – it can become destabilized.  This destabilizing neutron is like introducing a disruptive element into the tightly packed group.  The "bowling ball" then fissions, splitting into two smaller balls (daughter nuclei) and releasing several marbles (neutrons) along with a burst of energy. This energy release is akin to the sudden and forceful dispersal of the previously tightly bound group, releasing a large amount of kinetic energy. The released neutrons can then trigger further fissions in nearby nuclei, creating a chain reaction, much like a single spark igniting a field of dry grass.  The magnitude of the energy released is a consequence of the significant difference in binding energy between the initial heavy nucleus and the resultant lighter nuclei, analogous to the difference in the total energy stored in the initial tightly packed group compared to the energy of the now dispersed individuals.  Control of this chain reaction is crucial in harnessing nuclear fission for energy generation.
