Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and further neutrons. This chain reaction, driven by neutron bombardment, is the foundation of nuclear power generation and nuclear weaponry.  The energy released stems from the mass defect—the difference in mass between the initial nucleus and the resulting fission products—converted into energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²).  The process yields a variety of fission products, many of which are radioactive isotopes with long half-lives, posing significant challenges for waste management.

Practical applications of nuclear fission are primarily focused on energy production.  Nuclear power plants utilize controlled fission reactions in reactors to generate heat, which is then used to produce steam and drive turbines, generating electricity.  This provides a high-energy density power source, independent of fossil fuels and with lower greenhouse gas emissions. However, the inherent dangers associated with radioactivity and the long-term storage of nuclear waste remain critical concerns.  Beyond power generation, fission has also played a crucial role in the development of nuclear weapons, although its destructive potential necessitates stringent international regulations and safeguards.
