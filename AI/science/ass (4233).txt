Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, are cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their unique sp²-hybridized structure.  Their remarkable tensile strength, exceeding that of steel at a significantly lower density, makes them promising candidates for high-strength composites.  Depending on chirality – the arrangement of carbon atoms in the hexagonal lattice – CNTs can exhibit metallic or semiconducting behavior, offering versatility in electronic applications.  This tunability, coupled with their high aspect ratio, allows for applications ranging from field-effect transistors to transparent conductive films.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptionally high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of diamond along the axial direction, making them attractive for thermal management applications.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT synthesis to achieve desired chirality distributions and in overcoming issues related to bundling and aggregation that hinder their processing and performance.  Ongoing research focuses on scalable production methods, functionalization strategies to improve dispersibility, and the exploration of novel applications in energy storage, sensors, and biomedical engineering.
