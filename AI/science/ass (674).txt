Black hole formation constitutes a pivotal area of astrophysical research, demanding a comprehensive understanding of stellar evolution and gravitational collapse. This paper investigates the diverse pathways leading to the genesis of black holes, encompassing both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes. We review the prevailing theoretical models, focusing on the critical role of progenitor star properties, such as mass, metallicity, and rotation, in determining the ultimate fate of a star.  The interplay between stellar winds, mass loss, and convective processes is examined in detail, emphasizing their influence on the final core mass and the ensuing collapse dynamics.  Further, we explore the observational signatures associated with black hole formation, including supernovae, gravitational waves, and electromagnetic counterparts.  A particular focus is placed on recent advancements in numerical simulations, enabling higher-fidelity modelling of the complex hydrodynamics involved in the collapse process and subsequent accretion.  Finally, the paper addresses outstanding questions and future research directions, highlighting the need for further multi-messenger observations and improved theoretical modelling to fully elucidate the diverse mechanisms underpinning black hole formation across the cosmic landscape.
