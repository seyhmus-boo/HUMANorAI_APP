The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime with such intense gravity that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical groundwork, laid by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century, posited the existence of "dark stars" based on Newtonian physics. However, a rigorous understanding emerged only with Einstein's General Relativity in the early 20th century, providing the framework for gravitational collapse.

Stellar-mass black holes form from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (typically >20 solar masses) at the end of their life cycle.  Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel, the star's core implodes under its own gravity, overcoming degeneracy pressure.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, further collapse is unstoppable, leading to the singularity at the heart of the black hole and the formation of an event horizon – the boundary beyond which escape is impossible.  Supermassive black holes, residing at the centers of most galaxies, likely form through a combination of stellar-mass black hole mergers and direct collapse of gas clouds in the early universe, though the precise mechanisms remain areas of active research.  The observational evidence supporting black hole existence is robust, ranging from X-ray emissions from accreting material to gravitational wave detections from merging binary black holes.
