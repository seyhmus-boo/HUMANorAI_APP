Quantum entanglement describes a quantum mechanical phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation between them. This interconnectedness transcends classical correlations, exhibiting stronger-than-classical correlations that violate Bell's inequalities.  The entangled particles are described by a single, composite quantum state, not as individual particles with separate wave functions.  Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the corresponding property of the other, even if separated by vast distances. This instantaneous correlation doesn't violate causality, as no information can be transmitted faster than light; the outcome of the measurement on the first particle is inherently probabilistic.  The phenomenon arises from the superposition principle; entangled particles exist in a superposition of states until a measurement collapses the wave function, forcing both particles into definite, correlated states.  Understanding entanglement is crucial for developing quantum technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
