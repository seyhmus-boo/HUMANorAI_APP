Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 through transmission electron microscopy, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure.  These cylindrical allotropes of carbon, typically categorized as single-walled (SWCNTs) or multi-walled (MWCNTs), possess exceptionally high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel by several orders of magnitude.  Their Young's modulus is also remarkably high, contributing to superior stiffness and elasticity.  

Significantly, the electronic properties of CNTs are highly dependent on their chirality (the helical arrangement of carbon atoms), ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour. This tunability offers immense potential in nanoelectronics.  Moreover, CNTs possess exceptional thermal conductivity, far surpassing that of copper, and exhibit high surface area, making them attractive for applications in thermal management and catalysis.  However, challenges remain, notably in controlling the chirality during synthesis and achieving large-scale, cost-effective production of high-quality, defect-free CNTs for widespread commercialization.  Ongoing research continues to explore the full potential of these remarkable nanomaterials.
