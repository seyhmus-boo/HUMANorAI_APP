This presentation explores the emerging field of quantum mechanics in biology, specifically focusing on its potential role in DNA replication fidelity.  While classical mechanics adequately describes many aspects of DNA replication, emerging evidence suggests that quantum effects may play a subtle but crucial role in processes like base pairing and enzymatic catalysis. We will examine the potential contributions of quantum tunneling to the speed and accuracy of hydrogen bond formation between complementary base pairs, highlighting recent theoretical and experimental findings supporting this hypothesis.  Furthermore, the role of quantum coherence in mediating protein-DNA interactions during replication will be discussed, exploring how entangled electronic states within DNA polymerase could enhance its catalytic efficiency.  We will critically assess the current limitations in experimentally verifying these quantum phenomena within the complex biological environment of the replication fork. Finally, we will outline future directions for research, including the development of advanced spectroscopic techniques and computational modelling to rigorously probe the quantum nature of DNA replication and its impact on genome stability and evolution.
