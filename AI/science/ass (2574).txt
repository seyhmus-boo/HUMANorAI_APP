Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential for diverse applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT chirality and diameter during synthesis remains elusive, resulting in heterogeneous samples with varying properties.  Characterizing the intricate structure and defects within individual CNTs necessitates advanced techniques such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy, which often struggle with the inherent complexity of CNT aggregates.  Furthermore,  the strong van der Waals forces between CNTs lead to bundling, hindering their dispersion in solvents and matrices, impacting processing and property measurements.  Quantifying the true intrinsic properties of individual, defect-free CNTs is thus difficult, often overshadowed by inter-tube interactions and sample heterogeneity.  Addressing these challenges requires further development of sophisticated synthesis techniques, advanced characterization methodologies capable of single-CNT analysis, and effective strategies for achieving homogeneous dispersion.  Overcoming these obstacles is crucial for translating the remarkable potential of CNTs into practical technological advancements.
