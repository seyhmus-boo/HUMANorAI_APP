Black hole formation, while classically described by gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, necessitates a quantum mechanical interpretation at its core.  The singularity, a point of infinite density predicted by General Relativity, is a breakdown of the classical framework.  Quantum gravity effects, still largely theoretical, are expected to become dominant near the event horizon and within the singularity itself.

One proposed mechanism involves the concept of a Planck star, where quantum gravitational pressure prevents the complete collapse to a singularity. Instead, a dense, ultra-compact object with a Planck-scale radius is formed. This model suggests that information might not be entirely lost, counter to the classical black hole information paradox.  Furthermore, Hawking radiation, a quantum phenomenon arising from particle-antiparticle pair creation near the event horizon, slowly evaporates the black hole's mass, potentially resolving the information paradox.  However, the details of how quantum gravity modifies the spacetime geometry within the black hole remain elusive, demanding further exploration through theoretical frameworks like string theory and loop quantum gravity to reconcile general relativity with quantum mechanics in this extreme regime.
