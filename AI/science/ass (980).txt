Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon profoundly challenging classical intuition.  In essence, entanglement describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them. This correlation arises from a shared quantum state, described by a composite wave function that cannot be factored into individual wave functions for each subsystem.  Crucially, this means the constituent particles do not possess individually defined properties prior to measurement.

Instead, their properties are only determined upon measurement, and the outcomes are correlated in a way that violates Bell's inequalities, ruling out classical explanations based on local hidden variables.  Measurement on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, irrespective of distance.  This does *not* allow faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of the measurement on one particle remains random; however, the correlation between the outcomes is perfectly deterministic.  The implications for quantum computing and cryptography are significant, as entanglement underpins many quantum information protocols.  We will explore these implications further in subsequent lectures.
