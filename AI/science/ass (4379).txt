Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them promising candidates for a diverse range of applications.  However, a comprehensive understanding of these properties necessitates a quantum mechanical framework, moving beyond classical descriptions. This paper investigates the fundamental properties of CNTs through the lens of quantum mechanics, focusing on how their unique electronic structure, dictated by the spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms and their specific chirality, governs their observed macroscopic behaviour.  We explore the application of density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding models in predicting band structure,  electronic conductivity (metallic vs. semiconducting), and optical properties. The influence of structural defects, including vacancies and Stone-Wales transformations, on the electronic and vibrational characteristics will be analysed, highlighting the sensitivity of CNT properties to nanoscale imperfections.  Furthermore, we address the challenges and limitations of current quantum mechanical approaches in accurately modelling the complex interactions within and between CNTs, particularly in larger systems and under various environmental conditions.  This investigation ultimately aims to provide a deeper understanding of the quantum mechanical underpinnings of CNT functionality, paving the way for improved design and control of these remarkable materials.
