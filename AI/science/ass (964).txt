Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional characteristics stemming from their unique structure.  CNTs, essentially rolled-up sheets of graphene, exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).  Their cylindrical geometry bestows them with extraordinary strength, exhibiting tensile strength far exceeding steel.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, exhibiting metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality â€“ the arrangement of carbon atoms within the lattice.  This tunable conductivity, combined with high thermal conductivity and a large surface area, underpins their diverse applications.

Practically, CNTs are finding use in various fields. Their strength is exploited in advanced composites for aerospace and automotive applications.  Their electrical properties are harnessed in electronics, such as transistors and flexible displays.  Their high surface area facilitates their use in energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors, while their thermal conductivity enhances heat dissipation in electronics.  Ongoing research continues to explore the potential of CNTs in areas such as medicine and water purification, demonstrating their significant potential across numerous technological domains.
