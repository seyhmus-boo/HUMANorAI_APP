Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 through transmission electron microscopy, are cylindrical structures composed of rolled-up graphene sheets.  Their unique properties stem from this sp² hybridized carbon structure and their nanoscale dimensions.  Exceptional mechanical strength, a consequence of strong covalent bonding within the graphene lattice, makes CNTs significantly stronger than steel, while their high aspect ratio contributes to remarkable flexibility.  

Electrically, CNTs can exhibit either metallic or semiconducting behavior, depending on their chirality – the angle of the graphene sheet's rolling. This tunability offers potential for applications in electronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity along the tube axis due to efficient phonon transport, facilitating heat dissipation in advanced materials. Their large surface area to volume ratio enables significant adsorption capacity, making them attractive for applications in energy storage and catalysis.  These combined properties have fueled extensive research into exploiting CNTs across diverse technological fields.
