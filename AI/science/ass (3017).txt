Good morning. Today's lecture concerns chemical bonding and molecular structure, fundamental concepts underpinning our understanding of matter.  Weâ€™ve traditionally relied on valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory to explain bonding, predicting molecular geometry via VSEPR and hybridisation. However, recent advancements significantly refine these models.

Density functional theory (DFT), a computationally intensive method, allows for more accurate prediction of molecular properties, including bond lengths and energies, surpassing the limitations of simpler models, especially for larger molecules.  Furthermore, advancements in experimental techniques like X-ray free-electron lasers provide unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution, enabling the direct observation of bond breaking and formation dynamics during chemical reactions, validating and challenging theoretical predictions.

Finally, the burgeoning field of topological data analysis is offering new ways to analyse complex molecular structures and interactions, moving beyond traditional representations and providing deeper insights into reactivity and emergent properties.  These developments collectively enhance our predictive capacity and refine our fundamental understanding of chemical bonding.
