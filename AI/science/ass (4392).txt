Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars.  Historically, the concept emerged indirectly from John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace's 18th-century speculations on "dark stars," objects so massive that light could not escape their gravitational pull.  Einstein's General Theory of Relativity in the early 20th century provided the rigorous framework, demonstrating that sufficiently compact matter could warp spacetime to form a singularity – a point of infinite density.

The process begins with a star exceeding approximately 20 solar masses.  Following its main sequence lifetime, hydrogen fusion ceases, leading to core collapse.  If the core mass surpasses the Chandrasekhar limit (~1.4 solar masses), electron degeneracy pressure fails to withstand gravity.  This results in a runaway collapse, overcoming neutron degeneracy pressure, ultimately forming a singularity surrounded by an event horizon – the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  Different progenitor star masses and rotation rates influence the resulting black hole's properties, including mass and spin.  The ensuing explosion, a supernova, disperses the outer layers of the star, leaving behind the collapsed core as a black hole.
