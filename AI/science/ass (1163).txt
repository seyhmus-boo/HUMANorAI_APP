Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the intricate mechanisms of photosynthesis, a process fundamental to life on Earth.  Historically, the understanding of photosynthesis evolved gradually.  Early observations focused on the plant's uptake of carbon dioxide and release of oxygen, a phenomenon investigated by Jan Ingenhousz in the late 18th century.  However, the critical role of light wasn't fully elucidated until later.

The overall process can be broadly divided into two stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent, or Calvin, cycle.  In the light-dependent reactions, light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and other pigments within photosystems I and II, driving electron transport chains that generate ATP and NADPH.  Water is split, releasing oxygen as a byproduct.  The Calvin cycle, occurring in the stroma, utilises this ATP and NADPH to fix atmospheric CO2 into organic molecules, primarily glucose, through a series of enzyme-catalysed reactions.  This remarkable process, refined over millennia of evolution, underpins the vast majority of Earth's biomass production and sustains most ecosystems.
