Good morning. Today's lecture concerns DNA replication, the fundamental process by which cells duplicate their genetic material.  Early understanding, predating Watson and Crick's 1953 model, posited a conservative or dispersive mechanism.  However, the now-accepted semi-conservative model, experimentally validated by Meselson and Stahl in 1958, demonstrates that each new DNA molecule comprises one parental and one newly synthesised strand.

This process initiates at specific origin sites, where the enzyme helicase unwinds the double helix, creating a replication fork.  Single-strand binding proteins prevent reannealing, while topoisomerase relieves torsional stress.  Primase then synthesizes RNA primers, providing a starting point for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for adding nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, forming Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes primers and replaces them with DNA, and DNA ligase seals the fragments, completing replication.  This intricate process ensures faithful transmission of genetic information across generations, a cornerstone of life itself.
