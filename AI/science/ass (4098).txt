Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is a process underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry.  Its discovery, stemming from the work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, initially observed the unexpected production of barium from uranium bombarded with neutrons.  Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch subsequently interpreted this as nuclear fission, explaining the large energy release through Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.  This pivotal discovery rapidly advanced with the theoretical work of Niels Bohr and John Wheeler, developing the liquid-drop model to describe the fission process.

Crucially, the realization that fission releases additional neutrons, capable of inducing further fission events, led to the concept of a chain reaction. This self-sustaining process, controlled in nuclear reactors via moderators and control rods, enables controlled energy release.  Conversely, uncontrolled chain reactions form the basis of nuclear weapons.  Different fissile isotopes, primarily Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, exhibit varying fission probabilities and neutron yields, influencing reactor design and weapon effectiveness.  The understanding of fission cross-sections and neutron kinetics is paramount to controlling and harnessing this powerful process, posing both significant benefits and risks to humanity.
