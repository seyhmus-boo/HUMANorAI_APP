Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding a multifaceted approach integrating observational astronomy, theoretical physics, and computational astrophysics. This presentation explores the diverse pathways to black hole genesis, focusing on the interplay between these disciplines. We will examine stellar-mass black hole formation through core-collapse supernovae, highlighting the crucial role of stellar evolution models and sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations in predicting the final fate of massive stars.  Furthermore, we will discuss the formation of supermassive black holes, a topic riddled with ongoing debate.  The interplay between galaxy formation simulations and observations from multi-wavelength surveys, including gravitational wave detections, will be discussed, emphasizing the challenges in understanding seed black hole formation and subsequent growth mechanisms.  Interdisciplinary collaboration, particularly in bridging the gap between general relativity and nuclear physics, remains crucial for advancing our understanding. This presentation will showcase recent breakthroughs and highlight outstanding questions concerning the formation of black holes across the mass spectrum, emphasizing the need for continued interdisciplinary research to unravel these complex astrophysical phenomena.
