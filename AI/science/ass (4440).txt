Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with unique cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit a remarkable confluence of properties that bridge several scientific disciplines.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from the strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds forming their hexagonal lattice, is of interest to materials science and engineering, enabling applications in high-strength composites and nano-electromechanical systems (NEMS).  Simultaneously, their electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, finds relevance in electronics and nanotechnology, offering potential for next-generation transistors and flexible electronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, a crucial factor in thermal management applications explored by chemical engineers designing advanced heat sinks and energy storage systems.  The large surface area of CNTs makes them ideal adsorbents, attracting significant attention in chemistry and environmental science for applications such as water purification and gas sensing.  Finally, their biocompatibility, though context-dependent, opens doors for biomedical applications investigated by biologists and medical researchers, including drug delivery and tissue engineering.  This interdisciplinary nature of CNT research underscores their potential to revolutionize diverse technological fields.
