Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating process of black hole formation.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  When a star, typically exceeding 20 solar masses, exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core can no longer withstand its own immense gravity.  This initiates a catastrophic inward collapse, resulting in a singularity – a point of infinite density – surrounded by an event horizon, the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, are thought to form through a variety of mechanisms, potentially including the accretion of stellar-mass black holes or the direct collapse of massive gas clouds.

While seemingly esoteric, understanding black hole formation has significant practical applications.  Accretion disks surrounding black holes generate powerful jets of relativistic particles, observable across the electromagnetic spectrum.  Studying these jets improves our understanding of high-energy astrophysical phenomena. Furthermore, gravitational wave astronomy, born from the detection of ripples in spacetime caused by black hole mergers, provides invaluable insights into the dynamics of these cosmic objects and tests Einstein's theory of general relativity under extreme conditions.  These advancements further our understanding of the universe's evolution and fundamental physics.
