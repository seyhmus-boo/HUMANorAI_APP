Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into smaller nuclei, represents a pivotal scientific discovery with profound technological implications.  Its historical roots trace back to the theoretical work of Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, culminating in their 1938 experimental demonstration of uranium fission induced by neutron bombardment.  This breakthrough, initially interpreted with crucial input from Fritz Strassmann and Meitner, unveiled the immense energy locked within the atom's nucleus, explained by the mass defect elucidated by Einstein's E=mcÂ².

Subsequent research focused on understanding the chain reaction nature of fission, driven by the release of additional neutrons upon splitting.  This understanding underpinned the development of both nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors.  Controlled chain reactions, achieved through careful moderation and control rod mechanisms, allow for the sustainable release of energy for electricity generation. Conversely, uncontrolled chain reactions form the basis of nuclear weapons, releasing catastrophic amounts of energy.  The study of fission continues to evolve, encompassing advancements in reactor design aiming for improved safety and waste management, alongside ongoing research into alternative nuclear fuels and the potential of Accelerator-Driven Systems (ADS).
