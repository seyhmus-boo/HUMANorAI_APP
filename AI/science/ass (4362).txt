Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential across diverse technological applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT growth, crucial for achieving desired chirality and diameter distributions, remains a significant hurdle.  Current synthesis methods, including chemical vapor deposition and arc discharge, often yield heterogeneous mixtures of CNTs, demanding complex and costly purification procedures that can compromise the material's inherent properties.  Furthermore, characterizing the structural and electronic properties of individual CNTs presents difficulties.  Techniques like transmission electron microscopy (TEM) provide high-resolution imaging, but accurate chirality assignment requires advanced image processing and remains prone to errors.  Electrical characterization is complicated by contact resistance issues and the difficulty in isolating individual nanotubes from bundled structures.  Finally, the inherent tendency of CNTs to aggregate limits their dispersibility in various matrices, hindering their integration into composite materials.  Addressing these experimental challenges is paramount for unlocking the full potential of CNTs in advanced technologies.
