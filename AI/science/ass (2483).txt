Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on catalysts in organic chemistry.  Catalysts are substances that accelerate chemical reactions without being consumed themselves. In organic chemistry, they are crucial for achieving selective transformations, often under milder conditions than uncatalyzed reactions.  Their action typically involves lowering the activation energy of a reaction, thereby increasing the reaction rate.

Catalysts can be homogeneous, dissolving in the reaction mixture, or heterogeneous, existing in a separate phase.  Homogeneous catalysts, frequently transition metal complexes, often exhibit high selectivity due to precise coordination interactions.  Heterogeneous catalysts, such as zeolites and metal nanoparticles, are advantageous due to their ease of separation from the product mixture.

Practical applications are ubiquitous.  In the pharmaceutical industry, asymmetric catalysis enables the synthesis of chiral drugs with enhanced efficacy and reduced side effects.  Industrial processes like polymerization, oxidation, and hydrogenation rely heavily on catalysts to produce a vast array of commercially important products, including plastics, detergents, and fuels.  The development of increasingly efficient and selective catalysts remains a central area of research in organic chemistry.
