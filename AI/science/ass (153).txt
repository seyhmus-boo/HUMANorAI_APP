Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked, exhibiting correlated behaviour regardless of spatial separation.  This correlation transcends classical physics; measuring the state of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the state of the others, even across vast distances.  This seemingly instantaneous correlation doesn't violate causality, as no information transfer faster than light occurs.  Instead, the entangled particles share a unified quantum state, described by a single wavefunction encompassing all possibilities until measurement collapses it into a definite state for each particle.  The underlying mechanism is attributed to the superposition principle and the inherent non-locality of quantum mechanics.

Practically, quantum entanglement holds immense potential.  Quantum computing harnesses entanglement to perform computations exponentially faster than classical computers, leveraging superposition and entanglement for parallel processing.  Quantum cryptography utilizes entangled photons to create unconditionally secure communication channels, as any eavesdropping attempt inevitably alters the entangled state.  Furthermore, advancements in quantum sensing and metrology leverage entanglement for enhanced precision in measuring physical quantities like magnetic fields or gravitational waves, promising breakthroughs in various scientific fields.
