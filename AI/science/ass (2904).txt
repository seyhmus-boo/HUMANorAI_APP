CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient tool for genome editing.  This review summarizes the current applications and limitations of CRISPR technology in diverse fields.  Its ease of use and programmability, facilitated by guide RNA design, enable targeted gene disruption, insertion, and base editing with significantly improved accuracy compared to earlier methods.  Applications span fundamental research, including gene function studies and disease modelling, as well as translational medicine, with promising results in gene therapy for inherited disorders like sickle cell anemia and Î²-thalassemia.  Agricultural applications focus on enhancing crop yield and resistance to pests and diseases.  However, challenges remain, including off-target effects, delivery limitations, particularly in vivo, and ethical concerns surrounding germline editing.  Ongoing research focuses on improving specificity, developing novel delivery systems (e.g., viral vectors, nanoparticles), and exploring base editing and prime editing for more refined genome manipulations.  Despite these limitations, CRISPR technology continues to represent a significant advancement in genetic engineering, with immense potential for future therapeutic and biotechnological applications.
