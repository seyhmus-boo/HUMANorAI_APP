The formation of black holes, enigmatic celestial objects characterized by an event horizon beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape, remains a significant area of astrophysical research. While classical general relativity provides a robust framework for describing the macroscopic properties and gravitational influence of black holes, their formation from collapsing stellar remnants necessitates a deeper understanding incorporating quantum mechanical effects. This paper investigates the quantum mechanical aspects crucial to the process of black hole formation, moving beyond the classical picture of gravitational collapse. We explore how quantum fluctuations, particularly in the early universe and within the collapsing stellar core, might influence the dynamics of gravitational collapse and the ultimate formation of a singularity.  Specifically, we examine the role of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, focusing on potential modifications to the classical predictions near the event horizon.  Furthermore, we address the interplay between quantum gravity and the information paradox, considering the implications of Hawking radiation and the potential loss of information during black hole formation and evaporation. By integrating quantum mechanical principles into the narrative of black hole formation, we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of these captivating objects and their profound implications for our understanding of the universe.
