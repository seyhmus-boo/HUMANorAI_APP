Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, remains a significant source of energy and a subject of ongoing research.  The process typically involves bombarding fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with neutrons, inducing a chain reaction that releases vast amounts of energy.  This energy liberation stems from the mass defect, the difference in mass between the reactants and products, converted into energy via Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  Conventional fission reactors utilize controlled chain reactions, employing moderators to slow neutrons and control rods to absorb excess neutrons.

Recent developments focus on enhancing safety, efficiency, and waste management.  Advanced reactor designs, like Generation IV reactors, emphasize inherent safety features, minimizing the risk of meltdowns.  These designs explore various fuel cycles, including thorium-based reactors, potentially reducing long-lived waste products.  Furthermore, research into accelerator-driven subcritical systems (ADS) aims to improve fuel efficiency and transmute nuclear waste into less hazardous materials.  Finally, the exploration of novel fuel forms and improved neutron economy contributes towards more sustainable and efficient fission energy production, addressing crucial concerns regarding proliferation and waste disposal.
