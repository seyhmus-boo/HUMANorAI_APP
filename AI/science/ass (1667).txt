Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure and unique morphology.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to remarkable mechanical strength and stiffness, exceeding that of steel by orders of magnitude.  This, combined with low density, makes them ideal for reinforcement in composite materials.  

Electrically, CNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality (the arrangement of hexagonal carbon rings).  This tunable conductivity is exploited in electronics, offering potential for high-performance transistors and interconnects.  Furthermore, their high surface area facilitates excellent adsorption capabilities, making them promising candidates for gas storage, sensors, and catalysis.

These properties translate into diverse practical applications.  High-strength CNT-reinforced composites are explored in aerospace and automotive industries.  Their electrical properties find use in flexible electronics and energy storage devices.  Their adsorptive capacity is being utilized in water purification and environmental remediation technologies.  However, challenges remain in scalable production and efficient dispersion for widespread implementation.
