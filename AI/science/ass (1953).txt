CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and versatile platform for genome editing.  This review summarizes the key advancements and applications of CRISPR technology, highlighting its advantages over previous gene editing methods such as ZFNs and TALENs.  The simplicity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness of CRISPR-Cas9, particularly, have enabled widespread adoption across diverse research fields.  Applications range from basic research elucidating gene function to therapeutic development targeting genetic diseases, including inherited disorders and cancers.  While the technology holds immense promise, this review also addresses current limitations, including off-target effects, delivery challenges, and ethical considerations surrounding germline editing.  Recent advancements, such as base editing and prime editing, aim to mitigate off-target activity and expand the scope of possible gene modifications.  Future research directions include refining targeting specificity, developing more efficient delivery systems, and addressing the ethical implications of this powerful technology to ensure responsible and beneficial application in human health and beyond.
