The concept of chemical bonding, explaining the forces holding atoms together in molecules, has evolved significantly since Dalton's atomic theory.  Early models, like Kekulé's structural formulas, focused on valence and connectivity, providing a descriptive framework but lacking a mechanistic explanation.  The advent of quantum mechanics revolutionized the field.  The understanding of bonding now hinges on the electrostatic interactions between positively charged nuclei and negatively charged electrons, ultimately described by the Schrödinger equation.

Two primary bonding types are covalent and ionic.  Covalent bonds arise from the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, minimizing overall energy through orbital overlap.  The resulting molecular structure is dictated by the number of valence electrons and the principles of VSEPR (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) theory, predicting molecular geometries.  Ionic bonds, conversely, form from the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, originating from significant electronegativity differences.  Intermediate cases exist, exemplified by polar covalent bonds exhibiting partial ionic character.  Ultimately, molecular structure, including bond lengths, angles, and conformations, dictates macroscopic properties such as reactivity and physical state, showcasing the intricate connection between microscopic interactions and macroscopic behaviour.
