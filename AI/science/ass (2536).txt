Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, releases a significant amount of energy, underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry.  The process is initiated by neutron bombardment, typically of fissile isotopes like Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239.  Neutron absorption induces an unstable, highly energetic state in the nucleus, leading to its subsequent fission.  This fission event yields, on average, two or three neutrons alongside the lighter daughter nuclei and a substantial release of kinetic energy.  These released neutrons can then trigger further fission events in nearby fissile nuclei, creating a self-sustaining chain reaction.  The precise yield and distribution of fission products are probabilistic, varying depending on the target nucleus and incident neutron energy.  Control over the chain reaction rate is crucial for practical applications, achieved through the use of neutron moderators and control rods to maintain a stable and safe energy output.  The efficient harnessing of this energy relies on effectively capturing the kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.
