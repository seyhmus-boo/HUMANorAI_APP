The quantum mechanical treatment of chemical bonding and molecular structure provides a significantly more nuanced and accurate understanding than classical models.  This approach leverages the Schrödinger equation to describe the behavior of electrons within molecules, moving beyond simplistic electrostatic interactions.  Key concepts, such as molecular orbitals formed through linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO-MO), elegantly explain bonding phenomena.  The resulting energy diagrams reveal bonding, antibonding, and non-bonding orbitals, correlating directly with bond order and molecular stability.  Furthermore, quantum mechanics allows for the prediction of molecular geometries through techniques like hybridization theory, which explains deviations from simple VSEPR models by considering orbital mixing.  Density functional theory (DFT) offers a computationally tractable method for exploring complex molecular systems, enabling the prediction of various properties including bond lengths, bond energies, and dipole moments. While computationally demanding, quantum mechanical approaches are indispensable for comprehending intricate bonding situations, such as those involving transition metals and extended conjugated systems, providing crucial insights inaccessible to classical methods.  The limitations often arise from the approximations inherent in solving the many-body Schrödinger equation, necessitating the use of sophisticated computational techniques.
