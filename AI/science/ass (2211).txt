Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation.  This correlation surpasses classical physics, exhibiting strong correlations even at vast distances.  Einstein famously termed this "spooky action at a distance."

Recent developments have significantly advanced our understanding and applications of entanglement.  Advances in quantum computing leverage entangled qubits to perform computations impossible for classical systems, showcasing potential breakthroughs in fields like materials science and cryptography.  Experimental techniques, notably involving trapped ions and superconducting circuits, have achieved increasingly higher levels of entanglement fidelity and scalability.  Furthermore, research into quantum networks utilizes entangled photons to transmit quantum information over long distances, paving the way for a quantum internet.  While challenges remain in scaling and maintaining entanglement stability, the ongoing progress suggests significant potential for future technological and fundamental scientific advancements.
