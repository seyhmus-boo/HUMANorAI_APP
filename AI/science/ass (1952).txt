Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on black hole formation, a fascinating area of ongoing research.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses.  This collapse, following supernovae, is driven by the overwhelming gravitational pull of the remnant core, exceeding even neutron degeneracy pressure.  Recent simulations have refined our understanding of this process, particularly the role of asymmetries in the supernova explosion and their influence on the black hole's final mass and spin.

Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, pose a more enigmatic origin.  While hierarchical merging of smaller black holes contributes significantly, the formation mechanisms of the first generation of supermassive black holes remain a subject of intense debate.  Recent observations suggest the possibility of direct collapse from massive gas clouds in the early universe, bypassing the stellar evolution pathway, a hypothesis supported by advanced hydrodynamic simulations.  Further research, particularly via gravitational wave astronomy and advanced imaging techniques, promises to clarify these processes in the coming years.
