Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The stability of a molecule arises from the lowering of the total energy of the system compared to its constituent atoms.  This energy reduction is a consequence of the interaction between the electrons and nuclei of the participating atoms, described by the molecular Schr√∂dinger equation.  Solutions to this equation yield molecular orbitals (MOs), which are delocalized wavefunctions encompassing the entire molecule.  The formation of bonding MOs involves constructive interference of atomic orbitals, leading to increased electron density between nuclei, and a resultant attractive force.  Conversely, antibonding MOs arise from destructive interference, resulting in nodal planes of zero electron density and destabilizing the molecule.

The distribution of electrons within these MOs dictates the molecule's geometry.  The Pauli Exclusion Principle restricts electron occupancy in MOs, influencing bond order and the spatial arrangement of atoms to minimize electron-electron repulsion and maximize electron-nucleus attraction.  Hybridization of atomic orbitals, a quantum mechanical concept, further explains observed molecular geometries by allowing for the formation of equivalent hybrid orbitals optimally positioned for bonding.  Hence, the observed molecular structure is a direct consequence of the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons within the molecule.
