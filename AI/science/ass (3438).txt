Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional material properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of sp²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices.  Their remarkable strength arises from the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheets forming the tube walls, resulting in tensile strengths significantly higher than steel.  Depending on the chirality – the arrangement of hexagons around the tube axis – CNTs can exhibit metallic or semiconducting behavior, offering potential for electronic applications.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to exceptional electrical conductivity along the tube axis, superior to copper in some cases, and high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of diamond.  Furthermore, their large surface area facilitates efficient adsorption and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in controlling chirality and achieving large-scale, cost-effective production of high-quality CNTs with consistent properties, hindering widespread practical implementation despite their theoretically exceptional characteristics.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these limitations to unlock their full potential across diverse fields.
