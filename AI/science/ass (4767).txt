Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating phenomenon of quantum entanglement.  From a quantum mechanical perspective, entanglement describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation surpasses classical probabilistic descriptions, exhibiting a strong interdependence even when the entangled particles are spatially separated.

Mathematically, entangled states are represented by composite wavefunctions that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each subsystem. This implies that measuring a property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the corresponding observable of the other, regardless of the distance separating them. This does *not* violate special relativity, as no information is transmitted faster than light; the correlation exists prior to measurement.

The key is that the individual particles don't possess definite values for the measured properties prior to measurement.  Instead, the entangled state describes a superposition of possibilities. Measurement collapses this superposition, determining the values for both particles simultaneously, reflecting the non-local correlation inherent in the entangled state.  This profound connection lies at the heart of many quantum information technologies, such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
