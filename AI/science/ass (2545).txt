DNA replication is a semiconservative process ensuring the faithful duplication of genetic material prior to cell division.  The process initiates at specific origins of replication where the double helix unwinds, forming replication forks.  Helicases catalyze unwinding, while single-stranded binding proteins prevent reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate synthesis of leading and lagging strands.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments. DNA polymerase I removes primers and replaces them with DNA, and DNA ligase seals the nicks between fragments.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases.

The understanding of DNA replication has profound practical applications.  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) leverages the principles of DNA replication to amplify specific DNA sequences, crucial for diagnostics, forensics, and genetic engineering.  Furthermore, knowledge of replication mechanisms informs the development of anticancer drugs targeting DNA replication enzymes, disrupting tumor cell proliferation.  Research into replication fidelity also provides insights into mutagenesis and the origins of genetic diseases.
