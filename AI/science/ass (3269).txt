Nuclear fission, the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal development in human history with profound implications for energy production, medicine, and weaponry.  The discovery of this phenomenon, though initially unintentional, marked a turning point in our understanding of nuclear physics.  Following the pioneering work of researchers like Ernest Rutherford in unraveling the structure of the atom, the theoretical groundwork for fission was laid in the 1930s through the investigations of Lise Meitner and Otto Hahn, culminating in their experimental demonstration of uranium fission in 1938.  This groundbreaking discovery, further explained by Frisch and Meitner's theoretical interpretation involving the concept of nuclear liquid drop model, rapidly spurred intense scientific interest.  The subsequent Manhattan Project, a monumental collaborative effort during World War II, tragically showcased the destructive potential of fission in the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.  However, the potential for harnessing fission for peaceful purposes, primarily through nuclear power generation, also became a focus of post-war research and development. This paper will delve into the fundamental physics governing nuclear fission processes, exploring different fission mechanisms, the factors influencing fission yield, and the ongoing challenges associated with nuclear reactor technology and nuclear waste management.
