Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, is fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles.  The process initiates when a neutron interacts with the target nucleus, typically via the strong nuclear force, a residual effect of the quantum chromodynamic force acting between quarks.  This interaction perturbs the nucleus's wave function, potentially leading to a state of high excitation energy.  The resultant unstable nucleus exhibits a tunnelling probability, determined by the potential barrier determined from the interplay of strong and electromagnetic forces, enabling it to overcome the strong attractive nuclear force holding the nucleons together. This tunnelling phenomenon, a direct consequence of the wave-particle duality of nucleons, is central to the probability of fission occurring.  The subsequent decay into fission fragments is also influenced by quantum mechanical effects.  Shell structure, arising from the quantized energy levels of nucleons within the nuclear potential well, impacts the stability and preferred mass distributions of the fragments.  Finally, the emission of neutrons during fission is a probabilistic event governed by the quantum mechanical tunneling of these neutrons through the nuclear potential.  Therefore, a complete understanding of nuclear fission necessitates a quantum mechanical framework, accounting for both the probabilistic nature of the process and the underlying quantum properties of nucleons and nuclei.
