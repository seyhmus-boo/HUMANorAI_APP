Black hole formation represents a crucial stage in stellar evolution, arising from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  After exhausting their nuclear fuel, stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses lack the internal pressure to counteract their own gravity.  This leads to a catastrophic implosion, compressing the stellar core to an infinitely dense singularity.  The immense gravitational pull of this singularity prevents even light from escaping, defining the event horizon.  While the precise physics surrounding the singularity remains unresolved, general relativity provides a robust framework for modelling the spacetime curvature surrounding black holes.  Alternative formation pathways, involving the collapse of supermassive star clusters, are proposed to account for the supermassive black holes residing at galactic centers.

The study of black hole formation holds significant practical applications.  Precise modelling of stellar collapse informs our understanding of supernovae and the synthesis of heavy elements.  Gravitational wave astronomy, enabled by the detection of mergers between black holes, provides invaluable data about both black hole properties and the underlying dynamics of spacetime.  Furthermore, the study of active galactic nuclei, powered by accreting supermassive black holes, contributes to our comprehension of galaxy evolution and large-scale structure formation in the universe.  Future research will focus on refining models to account for complex phenomena like magnetic fields and rotation during the collapse process.
