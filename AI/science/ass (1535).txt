Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems exhibit correlations exceeding those permitted by classical physics.  These correlations persist even when the entangled particles are spatially separated, defying locality.  The entangled state is described by a single, composite wave function, not as a statistical mixture of individual particle states.  Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the other, regardless of the distance. This seemingly instantaneous correlation doesn't violate special relativity, as no information can be transmitted faster than light; the correlations are only revealed upon measurement.

The theoretical underpinnings of entanglement are rooted in the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of Hilbert spaces used to represent multi-particle quantum systems.  Bell's theorem and subsequent experimental violations have definitively demonstrated the non-classical nature of entanglement, ruling out local hidden-variable theories.  Ongoing research explores applications of entanglement in quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation, leveraging its capacity for creating highly correlated states and enabling novel forms of information processing unavailable classically.  Despite extensive study, the fundamental nature of entanglement and its ontological implications remain subjects of ongoing debate within the quantum mechanics community.
