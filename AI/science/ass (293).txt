Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, present significant experimental challenges hindering their widespread application.  Their high aspect ratio and tendency to agglomerate due to strong van der Waals forces complicate handling and dispersion in solvents or matrices, necessitating the development of sophisticated functionalization techniques to improve processability.  Precise control over CNT diameter, chirality, and length remains elusive, impacting the reproducibility of desired properties.  Characterizing the structural and electronic properties of individual nanotubes within a sample is difficult, requiring advanced techniques like transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy, often limited by resolution and sample preparation complexities.  Furthermore, accurately determining the purity of CNT samples, distinguishing them from amorphous carbon or other impurities, is crucial yet often challenging, necessitating rigorous purification processes and advanced analytical methods. These experimental limitations underscore the need for further research into improved synthesis, purification, and characterization techniques to fully unlock the potential of CNTs in diverse applications.
