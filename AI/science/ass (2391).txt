DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life and a highly conserved mechanism across all domains of life.  The fidelity of this process is crucial, as errors can lead to mutations with potentially deleterious consequences.  This paper reviews the current understanding of eukaryotic DNA replication, focusing on the intricate interplay of proteins and enzymatic activities that ensure accurate and timely duplication of the genome. We explore the initiation phase, including the identification of origins of replication and the assembly of the pre-replication complex (pre-RC).  Subsequent stages, including unwinding of the double helix by helicases, primer synthesis by primases, leading and lagging strand synthesis by DNA polymerases, and proofreading mechanisms, are also examined in detail.  Furthermore, we address the coordination of replication with other cellular processes, such as chromatin remodeling and cell cycle checkpoints.  Finally, we discuss the implications of replication errors in disease pathogenesis and the potential therapeutic targets arising from our understanding of this essential process.  This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of current knowledge and highlight areas requiring further investigation.
