Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains shrouded in significant observational challenges despite substantial theoretical understanding.  This presentation will address the key experimental hurdles in directly confirming various proposed formation mechanisms, focusing on stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  While gravitational wave astronomy provides compelling evidence for stellar-mass black hole mergers, precisely determining their progenitor stars' characteristics and the evolutionary pathways leading to collapse remains difficult.  The lack of direct electromagnetic counterparts to many gravitational wave events hinders detailed analyses.  Similarly, the formation of supermassive black holes, millions to billions of times the mass of the Sun, presents an even greater enigma.  The currently favoured mechanisms, including direct collapse and mergers of smaller black holes, require rigorous testing.  This presentation will discuss the limitations of current observational techniques, including the difficulties in resolving high-redshift objects, distinguishing black hole activity from other astrophysical phenomena (e.g., active galactic nuclei), and accurately measuring black hole masses and spins.  Furthermore, it will explore the potential of future technologies, such as next-generation telescopes (e.g., JWST, ELT) and multi-messenger astronomy, to overcome these limitations and provide more definitive insights into the fascinating process of black hole formation.
