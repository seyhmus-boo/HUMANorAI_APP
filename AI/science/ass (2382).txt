Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the quantum mechanical underpinnings of catalysis in organic chemistry.  Catalysts, by definition, lower the activation energy of a reaction without being consumed.  From a quantum mechanical perspective, this manifests as a modification of the reaction's potential energy surface.  Specifically, catalysts achieve this by interacting with reactants, forming transient intermediate complexes.  These interactions involve orbital overlap, often through the donation or acceptance of electron density.  

Frontier molecular orbital theory provides a powerful framework for understanding this.  A catalyst's highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) or lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) can interact with the corresponding LUMO or HOMO of the reactants, respectively. This interaction destabilizes the reactant's orbitals, leading to a lower activation energy barrier.  Furthermore, catalysts can alter the electron distribution within the reactants, stabilizing the transition state and thus accelerating the reaction. This orbital manipulation ultimately facilitates bond breaking and formation along a lower-energy pathway than would be possible in the uncatalyzed reaction.  We'll explore specific examples in the following sections.
