Black hole formation remains a central problem in astrophysics, bridging stellar evolution with the most extreme environments in the universe. This presentation will review the current understanding of black hole formation pathways, focusing on the two primary mechanisms: stellar collapse and the direct collapse of supermassive stars.  We will examine the stellar evolution prerequisites for each pathway, considering the roles of metallicity, rotation, and binary interactions.  For stellar-mass black holes, the critical role of core-collapse supernovae and the resulting remnant mass will be discussed, highlighting recent advancements in numerical simulations and their implications for the mass distribution of stellar black holes observed through gravitational wave astronomy.  The formation of supermassive black holes, exceeding millions or billions of solar masses, presents a more significant challenge.  We will explore proposed formation scenarios, including direct collapse in pristine gas clouds and the subsequent growth through accretion and mergers, acknowledging the ongoing debate regarding the relative importance of these mechanisms. Finally, we will briefly address future research directions, including the need for improved theoretical modelling and observations to better constrain the initial conditions and evolutionary pathways leading to the formation of black holes across the observed mass spectrum.
