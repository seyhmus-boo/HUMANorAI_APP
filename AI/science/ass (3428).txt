Good morning. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission processes, a pivotal discovery shaping the 20th and 21st centuries.  The phenomenon, whereby a heavy atomic nucleus splits into smaller nuclei, releasing vast amounts of energy, was first observed experimentally in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, though the theoretical interpretation was provided by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.  Their work, building on earlier research into neutron bombardment of uranium, demonstrated the fission of uranium-235.

This process involves the absorption of a neutron, leading to an unstable nucleus that subsequently undergoes fission, releasing further neutrons and significant kinetic energy. This chain reaction, where the released neutrons trigger further fissions, forms the basis of nuclear power generation and weaponry.  Crucially, the mass of the resulting nuclei is slightly less than the original, the 'missing' mass being converted to energy, as elegantly described by Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  Control of this chain reaction, through moderator materials and control rods, is paramount in nuclear reactors, ensuring a sustained but safe energy output.  The uncontrolled chain reaction, conversely, characterises the destructive power of nuclear weapons.
