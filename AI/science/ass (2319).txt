The formation of black holes, culminating in spacetime singularities, remains a central problem in astrophysics, demanding a reconciliation between the classical description of gravity and the quantum mechanical nature of matter at extreme densities.  While general relativity provides a robust framework for modeling black hole evolution and gravitational dynamics at macroscopic scales, its inherent limitations at the Planck scale necessitate a quantum-gravitational perspective.  This paper explores the fundamental challenges in understanding black hole formation from a quantum mechanical viewpoint, focusing on the interplay between quantum fluctuations and gravitational collapse. We will examine how quantum effects, such as Hawking radiation and quantum tunneling, may alter our understanding of the classical picture, potentially influencing the initial conditions for collapse and the final state of the singularity.  Specifically, we will investigate the role of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, exploring scenarios where quantum phenomena might prevent or significantly modify the formation of a singularity, potentially leading to alternative final states, such as remnants or Planck-scale structures.  Ultimately, a comprehensive understanding requires a consistent framework unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, a challenge that lies at the forefront of modern theoretical physics.
