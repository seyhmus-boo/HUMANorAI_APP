Black hole formation represents a crucial intersection of astrophysics, general relativity, and nuclear physics.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (≥20 solar masses) at the end of their lifecycle.  The process, governed by Einstein's field equations, is intricately linked to the star's internal structure and composition, determined by stellar nucleosynthesis models.  These models, encompassing nuclear reactions and energy transport, dictate the star's pre-collapse density profile and thus the nature of the ensuing collapse – whether directly to a black hole or via a transient supernova.  Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), a less understood population, may form through runaway stellar collisions in dense stellar clusters, a scenario requiring sophisticated N-body simulations incorporating both Newtonian and relativistic dynamics.  Supermassive black holes (SMBHs), residing at galactic centers, pose a greater challenge.  While direct collapse models exist, the favoured explanation involves a process of accretion and mergers of smaller black holes, linking their formation to galaxy evolution and large-scale structure formation.  Interdisciplinary collaboration utilizing advanced computational techniques and observational data from multi-wavelength astronomy is essential to fully unravel the complexities of black hole formation across all mass scales.
