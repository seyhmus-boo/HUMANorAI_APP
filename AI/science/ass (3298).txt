DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating a DNA molecule, is fundamental to life.  The process involves unwinding the double helix by helicases, exposing single-stranded DNA templates.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing starting points for DNA polymerase III, which adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to the formation of leading and lagging strands.  DNA polymerase I replaces RNA primers with DNA, and ligase seals the Okazaki fragments on the lagging strand.

Recent developments have significantly enhanced our understanding.  Advances in single-molecule techniques, such as magnetic tweezers and nanopore sequencing, allow real-time observation of replication forks, providing insights into the dynamics of polymerase activity and the interplay of replication proteins.  Cryo-electron microscopy has revolutionized structural biology, revealing high-resolution structures of replication complexes, including the intricate interactions between polymerases and accessory proteins.  Furthermore, research into the role of non-canonical DNA structures and their impact on replication fidelity continues to yield significant findings, expanding our knowledge beyond the classical Watson-Crick model.  These advancements are crucial for understanding replication-associated diseases and developing targeted therapies.
