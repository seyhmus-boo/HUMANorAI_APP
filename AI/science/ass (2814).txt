CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering a precise and efficient method for genome editing. This review summarizes the current state of CRISPR technology, focusing on its applications and limitations.  The ease of use and programmability of CRISPR-Cas9, in particular, have facilitated its widespread adoption across diverse fields, from basic research to therapeutic development.  Successful applications include gene knockout and knock-in studies, gene correction for inherited diseases, and the generation of novel model organisms.  The review also highlights emerging CRISPR variants, such as base editors and prime editors, which enhance the precision and scope of genome modification, reducing off-target effects. Despite significant advancements, challenges remain. Off-target effects, delivery limitations, and ethical concerns associated with germline editing require careful consideration.  Future research should focus on improving delivery methods, enhancing specificity, and developing robust strategies for risk assessment and mitigation.  Ultimately, CRISPR technology holds immense promise for advancing our understanding of biology and developing novel therapies, but responsible implementation is crucial.
