The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting gravitational effects so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape, remains a central problem in astrophysics.  Early theoretical explorations, stemming from John Michell's and Pierre-Simon Laplace's 18th-century conceptions of "dark stars," posited objects whose gravitational pull was insurmountable.  However, it was Einstein's theory of General Relativity, published in 1915, that provided the rigorous framework for understanding black holes as solutions to his field equations.  Karl Schwarzschild's subsequent derivation of the first exact solution, describing a non-rotating, uncharged black hole, marked a pivotal moment.  

Despite this theoretical foundation, observational confirmation remained elusive for decades.  The discovery of quasars in the 1960s, incredibly luminous objects believed to be powered by supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies, provided the first compelling indirect evidence.  Subsequent advancements in observational techniques, particularly in X-ray and gravitational wave astronomy, have yielded more direct observational proof, including the detection of stellar-mass black hole mergers through gravitational waves by the LIGO and Virgo collaborations.  This research investigates the current understanding of black hole formation mechanisms, encompassing both stellar-mass and supermassive black holes, considering the diverse astrophysical environments and progenitor stars implicated in their genesis.
