Photosynthesis, the process converting light energy into chemical energy, involves intricate mechanisms still presenting significant experimental challenges.  Understanding the precise dynamics of electron transfer within photosystems I and II remains a major hurdle, with limitations in resolving the ultrafast processes involved. Techniques like time-resolved spectroscopy offer insights, but challenges remain in separating individual contributions from overlapping signals and accurately modelling complex protein environments.  Furthermore, studying the crucial role of accessory pigments and protein complexes in light harvesting and energy transfer is hampered by their dynamic interactions and heterogeneous distribution within the thylakoid membrane.  Investigating the structural changes during the catalytic cycle of Rubisco, the enzyme responsible for carbon fixation, is similarly challenging, requiring advanced techniques like cryo-electron microscopy to resolve conformational changes at atomic resolution. Finally, the study of photosynthesis *in vivo* necessitates tackling environmental complexities and inherent variations within plant populations, complicating the isolation of specific mechanistic details and the generalization of findings. Overcoming these experimental limitations necessitates the development of more sophisticated instrumentation and analytical methodologies.
