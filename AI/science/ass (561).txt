Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties that have captured significant scientific and technological interest.  Their unique structure, analogous to a rolled-up sheet of graphene – a single layer of graphite – bestows upon them a fascinating combination of characteristics. Imagine a material possessing the strength of steel, yet six times lighter,  a property reminiscent of the impressive strength-to-weight ratio found in natural spider silk.  This exceptional mechanical strength stems from the strong sp²-hybridized carbon-carbon bonds forming the nanotube lattice.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit remarkable electrical conductivity, behaving like either metallic conductors, akin to copper wires, or semiconductors, similar to silicon in transistors, depending on their chirality – the way the graphene sheet is rolled.  This tunable electrical behavior opens doors for diverse applications in electronics.  Finally, their high aspect ratio, resembling incredibly thin and long needles, leads to unique thermal properties, offering potential for heat dissipation applications, similar to the efficient heat transfer in a highly porous material like a heat sink. This paper will delve into the fundamental properties of CNTs, exploring their mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics, and discussing their implications for diverse technological advancements.
