Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the experimental challenges inherent in elucidating chemical bonding and molecular structure.  While theoretical models provide valuable insights, experimentally confirming these predictions often proves challenging.  Determining bond lengths and angles relies heavily on techniques like X-ray crystallography, which necessitates obtaining high-quality single crystals, a process that can be difficult, especially for complex or unstable molecules.  Furthermore, the interpretation of diffraction patterns requires sophisticated computational modelling, introducing potential sources of error.  Spectroscopic methods, such as NMR and IR spectroscopy, offer valuable complementary data, but peak assignments can be ambiguous, particularly in complex molecules, requiring advanced techniques like isotopic labelling to resolve ambiguities.  Similarly, studying gas-phase structures presents challenges in controlling and maintaining sample integrity.  Finally, dynamic systems, featuring conformational isomerism or fluxional behaviour, demand time-resolved techniques, which often require significant technological expertise and present significant data processing hurdles.  Therefore, a robust understanding of molecular structure demands a multi-faceted approach, combining diverse experimental techniques and robust data analysis.
