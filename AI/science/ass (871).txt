Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional properties rendering them attractive for diverse applications.  This presentation will explore the key attributes of CNTs, focusing on their remarkable mechanical strength, high electrical conductivity, and unique thermal properties.  Their exceptionally high Young's modulus surpasses that of steel, while their electrical conductivity can rival that of copper, depending on chirality and structural defects.  Furthermore, CNTs possess an exceptionally high thermal conductivity, enabling efficient heat dissipation.  These properties, combined with their high aspect ratio and tunable surface chemistry, make them ideal candidates for a wide range of applications.

We will discuss the practical implications of these properties, including their use in advanced composites for lightweight and high-strength materials in aerospace and automotive industries.  Their electrical conductivity finds application in flexible electronics, transparent conductive films, and energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and batteries.  Their high surface area facilitates their use as catalysts and in environmental remediation.  Finally, the presentation will briefly address challenges associated with CNT production, scalability, and functionalization for specific applications, highlighting areas of ongoing research and development.
