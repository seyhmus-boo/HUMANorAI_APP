Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, has captivated scientists since the theoretical prediction of these enigmatic objects by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916.  This presentation will explore the astrophysical mechanisms leading to the birth of black holes, tracing the evolution from initial theoretical conceptions to current observational evidence.  We will examine the two primary pathways: stellar-mass black holes, formed from the gravitational collapse of massive stars at the end of their lifecycle, and supermassive black holes, whose formation mechanisms remain an active area of research, with leading theories including direct collapse and the merging of smaller black holes.

The presentation will briefly review the historical context, highlighting milestones such as the discovery of Cygnus X-1, providing compelling observational evidence for stellar-mass black holes. We will then delve into contemporary research, focusing on gravitational wave detection via LIGO/Virgo, offering unprecedented insights into the mergers of stellar-mass black holes and providing constraints on their formation rates.  Finally, we will discuss ongoing challenges and future directions, including the investigation of supermassive black hole formation and the role of active galactic nuclei in the evolution of galaxies.  This presentation aims to provide a concise overview of black hole formation, emphasizing the interplay between theoretical models and observational data.
