The formation of black holes, enigmatic regions of spacetime with gravitational pull so intense that not even light can escape, represents a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Understanding their genesis requires grappling with the extreme conditions predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity.  Imagine a collapsing star as a deflating balloon: as its internal pressure diminishes, the star's own gravity inexorably pulls its matter inwards.  For stars significantly more massive than our Sun, this gravitational collapse is unremitting, surpassing any counteracting force.  This process, akin to a relentless sinkhole swallowing everything in its vicinity, ultimately leads to the formation of a singularity â€“ an infinitely dense point at the heart of the black hole.  The surrounding space is warped into a "gravitational well," a conceptual abyss from which nothing can return.  This paper will explore the diverse pathways leading to black hole formation, examining both stellar-mass black holes born from the supernovae of massive stars and the supermassive black holes residing at the centres of galaxies, the latter potentially arising from the merger of smaller black holes or the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe.  We will delve into the observational evidence supporting these theoretical models and address the outstanding questions that remain in this dynamically evolving field.
