Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a fascinating consequence of stellar evolution.  Imagine a massive star, perhaps tens of times the Sun's mass, as a colossal bonfire, furiously burning hydrogen fuel.  This combustion generates immense outward pressure, counteracting the inward pull of gravity.  However, when the fuel is exhausted, this outward pressure weakens drastically.  

The star's core, now primarily composed of heavier elements like iron, collapses catastrophically under its own immense gravity.  Think of it as a giant, unsupported building suddenly imploding.  This implosion triggers a supernova, a spectacular explosion flinging the star's outer layers into space.  Yet, the core continues its collapse, its density increasing exponentially.  Eventually, the gravitational pull becomes so intense that it surpasses even the escape velocity of light itself, forming what we term a singularity – a point of infinite density – at the heart of a black hole.  The region surrounding the singularity, from which nothing, not even light, can escape, constitutes the event horizon. This process, essentially a gravity-driven implosion of a massive stellar core, is the primary mechanism of stellar-mass black hole formation.
