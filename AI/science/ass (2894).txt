Black hole formation represents a pivotal process in astrophysical evolution, with profound implications for galactic dynamics and cosmology.  This presentation will explore the diverse mechanisms leading to black hole birth, focusing on stellar-mass black holes formed via the core-collapse of massive stars and supermassive black holes whose origins remain a subject of active debate. We will examine the crucial role of stellar metallicity, rotation, and magnetic fields in influencing the final fate of collapsing stars, contrasting these with proposed formation scenarios for supermassive black holes, including direct collapse and the merger of stellar-mass black holes.  

Beyond their intrinsic astrophysical interest, the study of black hole formation has practical applications.  Precise modeling of core-collapse supernovae, which often accompany black hole formation, is crucial for improving gravitational wave detection and interpretation.  Furthermore, understanding black hole accretion disks is essential for developing more accurate models of active galactic nuclei (AGN), which are used to probe the early universe and trace the distribution of dark matter.  The exploration of black hole physics also fuels advancements in numerical relativity and high-performance computing, impacting fields beyond astrophysics. This presentation will highlight these connections, underscoring the multidisciplinary impact of black hole formation research.
