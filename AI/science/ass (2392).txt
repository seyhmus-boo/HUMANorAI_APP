This presentation addresses the experimental challenges inherent in probing chemical bonding and molecular structure.  While theoretical models offer valuable insights, their accuracy relies heavily on precise experimental validation.  Determining accurate bond lengths, angles, and conformational preferences remains a significant undertaking, particularly for complex molecules or systems exhibiting dynamic behaviour.  We will examine limitations of various techniques, including X-ray diffraction, which struggles with light atoms and disordered systems, and neutron diffraction, which requires specialized facilities and substantial sample quantities.  Spectroscopic methods, such as NMR and vibrational spectroscopy, offer complementary information but often require sophisticated data analysis and interpretation, particularly for spectral overlap and peak assignments.  Furthermore, the challenge of studying molecules in their native environments, mimicking biological or industrial conditions, presents additional hurdles in sample preparation and data acquisition. The presentation will conclude by highlighting emerging techniques, such as cryogenic electron microscopy and advanced computational methods, which are pushing the boundaries of our ability to experimentally elucidate chemical bonding and molecular structure with improved accuracy and resolution.
