Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, was first observed experimentally in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, following theoretical predictions by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch.  This landmark discovery stemmed from investigations into the bombardment of uranium with neutrons.  The process releases a significant amount of energy, explained by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²), as the total mass of the products is slightly less than the mass of the original nucleus.

Fission typically involves the absorption of a neutron by a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, causing it to become unstable and undergo fission. This process yields two or more smaller daughter nuclei, along with several neutrons and a substantial release of kinetic energy. The emitted neutrons can then initiate further fission events in a chain reaction, the basis for nuclear reactors and weapons. The specific fission products vary, producing a complex mixture of radioactive isotopes, necessitating careful handling and disposal of nuclear waste.  Control over the chain reaction is crucial, achieved through neutron moderators and control rods in reactors to maintain a stable, self-sustaining reaction.
