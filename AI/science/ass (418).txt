Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on CRISPR-Cas systems, revolutionary tools in genetic engineering.  CRISPR, derived from bacterial adaptive immunity, utilizes guide RNA to direct the Cas enzyme, most commonly Cas9, to a specific DNA sequence.  This allows for highly precise gene editing – deletion, insertion, or modification – offering unparalleled control over the genome.

Recent developments significantly enhance CRISPR's capabilities. Base editing, for example, avoids double-stranded DNA breaks, mitigating off-target effects and increasing precision. Prime editing represents another significant advance, enabling all possible point mutations without relying on a double-stranded break or a donor DNA template.  Furthermore, research into  Cas enzyme variants expands the range of targetable sequences and improves efficacy. These advancements are driving applications across diverse fields, from disease modelling and gene therapy to crop improvement and synthetic biology.  The ongoing refinement of CRISPR technology promises further breakthroughs in our understanding and manipulation of the genome.
