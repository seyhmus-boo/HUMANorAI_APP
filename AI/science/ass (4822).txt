Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles. The strong nuclear force, responsible for binding nucleons, is inherently a short-range, quantum-mechanical interaction.  In heavy nuclei, like Uranium-235, the Coulomb repulsion between protons partially overcomes the strong force's attractive influence, resulting in a potential energy well with a relatively shallow barrier.  

Neutron absorption, a crucial step in fission, can elevate the nucleus into a higher energy state, exceeding the fission barrier. This transition is probabilistic, governed by quantum tunneling—the nucleus' wavefunction penetrates the barrier, allowing the transition even if classically insufficient energy exists.  Once beyond the barrier, the nucleus deforms, forming a 'neck' that eventually ruptures, driven by the strong repulsion between the accumulating protons.  The resulting daughter nuclei and emitted neutrons possess kinetic energies that reflect the overall energy release, quantified by the mass defect via Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²).  The emitted neutrons, themselves governed by quantum mechanical wave functions, can initiate a chain reaction, a central feature of nuclear reactors and weapons.
