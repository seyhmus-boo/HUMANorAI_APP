Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional material properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure.  Their high aspect ratio leads to exceptionally high tensile strength, surpassing that of steel, while maintaining remarkable flexibility.  This, coupled with low density, makes them attractive for composite reinforcement.  Furthermore, CNTs possess excellent thermal conductivity, both along the tube axis and, albeit less effectively, radially.  Electrical conductivity is highly dependent on chirality, with metallic nanotubes demonstrating conductivity comparable to copper, and semiconducting nanotubes exhibiting tunable band gaps.  These properties are further influenced by diameter and tube length.  Surface area is exceptionally high, contributing to their potential in applications like gas storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain regarding scalable production, purification, and dispersion for optimal exploitation of their remarkable properties in diverse technological applications.
