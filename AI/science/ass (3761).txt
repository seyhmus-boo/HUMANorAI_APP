DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning life, remains a subject of intense investigation.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of the core mechanisms of DNA replication, focusing on the intricate interplay between initiator proteins, helicases, polymerases, and other essential factors.  We will highlight the remarkable fidelity of the process and the sophisticated mechanisms employed to ensure accurate duplication and maintain genome stability.

Recent advances in single-molecule techniques have revolutionized our understanding of replication dynamics.  We will discuss novel insights into the processivity of polymerases, the regulation of replication fork progression, and the resolution of replication stress.  Specifically, we will explore the emerging role of non-canonical DNA structures in replication fork stalling and the multifaceted responses employed by cells to manage these challenges, including the involvement of specialized repair pathways.  Furthermore, the application of advanced imaging techniques, such as super-resolution microscopy, will be highlighted, showcasing their contribution to visualizing replication complexes in unprecedented detail. Finally, we will briefly touch upon the therapeutic potential of targeting specific aspects of DNA replication in cancer treatment.
