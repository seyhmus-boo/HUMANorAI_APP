Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a significant area of scientific inquiry and technological application.  This review summarizes the fundamental principles governing fission processes, focusing on the key factors influencing reaction rates and energy yields.  We examine the role of neutron interactions, including prompt and delayed neutron emissions, their influence on criticality, and the implications for reactor control.  Different fissionable isotopes, notably uranium-235 and plutonium-239, are compared with respect to their fission cross-sections and energy release.  The review further addresses the complexities of fission product formation, highlighting the challenges posed by the generation of radioactive waste and its long-term management.  Finally, we briefly discuss the ongoing research into advanced reactor designs aimed at improving efficiency, safety, and waste minimization, alongside the potential for utilizing nuclear fission as a sustainable energy source. While significant advancements have been made, critical considerations regarding safety and proliferation remain prominent areas of ongoing debate and investigation.
