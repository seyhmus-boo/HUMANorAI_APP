Chemical bonding and molecular structure are intrinsically linked, with the type of bond dictating the resulting three-dimensional arrangement of atoms.  Imagine atoms as individuals seeking stability, akin to people seeking companionship.  This stability is achieved through the sharing or transfer of electrons, the “glue” that holds atoms together. Covalent bonds, analogous to a strong handshake between two individuals, involve the sharing of electron pairs, resulting in discrete molecules with specific geometries like the tetrahedral structure of methane (CH₄).  The number of electron pairs involved and the presence of lone pairs (unshared electrons) influence the molecular shape, much like the number of hands and arms influencing how a group of people arrange themselves for a photograph.  Conversely, ionic bonds, resembling a more formal agreement between two parties with drastically different needs, involve the complete transfer of electrons from one atom (the less electronegative one, akin to a generous benefactor) to another (the more electronegative, like a demanding creditor), creating ions and resulting in crystalline structures held together by electrostatic attraction. This attraction, unlike the localized sharing in covalent bonds, extends throughout the crystal lattice.  Understanding these fundamental bonding types is crucial to predicting and interpreting the properties and reactivity of molecules and materials.
