Black hole formation constitutes a pivotal process in astrophysical evolution, arising from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stellar remnants or through the accretion of matter in galactic nuclei.  Stellar-mass black holes form following the supernova explosion of stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses.  The core's gravitational pressure surpasses the degeneracy pressure of neutrons, leading to an unstoppable inward collapse, ultimately resulting in a singularity hidden behind an event horizon.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, likely originate through a combination of mechanisms, including the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe, and subsequent mergers and accretion of stellar-mass black holes.  These processes are intricately linked to the distribution and evolution of galaxies, impacting star formation rates and galactic morphology through feedback mechanisms driven by accretion disks and relativistic jets.  Further research involving gravitational wave detection and multi-wavelength observations is vital in clarifying the nuanced pathways leading to black hole formation across various mass scales.
