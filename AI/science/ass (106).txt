Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons.  This abstract summarizes the key quantum mechanical principles underpinning these phenomena.  The stability of molecules arises from the lowering of the total electronic energy upon bond formation, a consequence of the wave-like nature of electrons and the Pauli exclusion principle.  Molecular orbital (MO) theory, based on the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO), provides a powerful framework for describing bonding, accounting for both bonding and antibonding orbitals.  The occupation of these MOs by electrons dictates bond order and consequently bond strength and length.  Hybridization of atomic orbitals, a crucial concept in valence bond (VB) theory, explains the geometries of molecules by considering the mixing of atomic orbitals to form hybrid orbitals with specific directional properties.  The relative merits of MO and VB theories are discussed, with MO theory being better suited for delocalized bonding systems and VB theory providing a more intuitive picture of localized bonds.  Ultimately, both theories offer complementary approaches to understanding the intricate relationship between chemical bonding, molecular structure, and the underlying quantum mechanics. Advanced computational methods based on density functional theory (DFT) further refine our predictive capabilities for complex systems.
