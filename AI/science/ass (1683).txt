DNA replication, a fundamental process in all living organisms, ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information during cell division.  This semiconservative process involves unwinding the parental double helix, mediated by helicases and aided by single-strand binding proteins, creating a replication fork.  Primase then synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH terminus for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for nucleotide addition in the 5' to 3' direction.  Leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously, while lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously, forming Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase then seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, creating a continuous lagging strand.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases, which correct misincorporated nucleotides.  Telomeres, repetitive sequences at chromosome ends, require specialized mechanisms like telomerase to prevent shortening during replication.  The intricate coordination of these enzymes ensures accurate and efficient duplication of the genome, crucial for cell proliferation and organismal survival.
