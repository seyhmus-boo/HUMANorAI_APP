Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of carbon atoms discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991.  This discovery revolutionised materials science, revealing a material with exceptional characteristics stemming from its unique sp² hybridised carbon structure.

CNTs exhibit extraordinary mechanical strength, possessing tensile strengths far exceeding steel, while simultaneously being exceptionally lightweight.  Their electrical properties are equally impressive; depending on chirality – the arrangement of hexagons in the lattice – CNTs can behave as metallic conductors or semiconducting materials, offering versatility in electronic applications.  Furthermore, their high aspect ratio and surface area contribute to superior thermal conductivity and significant adsorption capabilities.  This combination of mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties makes CNTs promising candidates for diverse applications, ranging from high-strength composites and nanoelectronics to energy storage and biomedical devices.  However, challenges remain in scalable production and precise control of chirality for consistent material properties.
