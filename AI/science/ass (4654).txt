Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure.  Their exceptional tensile strength and high Young's modulus make them promising candidates for reinforced composites, while their electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, suggests applications in nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation.

However, experimental investigation of these properties presents significant challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis, particularly achieving high purity and monodispersity in terms of diameter, length, and chirality, remains elusive.  Characterizing individual CNT properties necessitates advanced techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM), which can be time-consuming and prone to artefacts.  Moreover, the inherent tendency of CNTs to aggregate due to van der Waals forces complicates the accurate measurement of macroscopic properties, requiring complex dispersion strategies before testing.  Finally, the development of scalable and cost-effective methods for processing and integrating CNTs into functional devices is a major hurdle in translating their remarkable potential into practical applications.
