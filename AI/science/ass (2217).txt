DNA replication, the process of producing two identical replicas of DNA from one original DNA molecule, is crucial for cellular proliferation and heredity.  This semiconservative mechanism, elucidated by the Meselson-Stahl experiment, involves the unwinding of the parental double helix by helicases, creating a replication fork.  Single-stranded binding proteins prevent reannealing, while topoisomerases relieve torsional stress ahead of the fork.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate synthesis, adding nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, forming Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the phosphodiester backbone between Okazaki fragments, resulting in two complete DNA molecules, each composed of one parental and one newly synthesized strand. High fidelity is ensured through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases.  Errors that escape this process are subject to post-replicative repair pathways.
