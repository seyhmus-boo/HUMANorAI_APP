Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation.  This correlation surpasses classical physics, where separated systems exhibit independent behaviours.  Entangled particles share a combined quantum state, such that measurement of one instantly influences the state of the others, even at vast distances. This non-local correlation does not violate causality as no information transfer faster than light occurs.

Recent advancements significantly impact our understanding and application of entanglement.  Progress in scalable quantum computing leverages entanglement to enable powerful quantum algorithms surpassing classical computation.  Experimental breakthroughs include the generation of highly entangled states with an increasing number of qubits and the development of robust entanglement distribution techniques across optical fibres and free space, vital for long-distance quantum communication networks.  Furthermore, investigations into the foundational aspects of entanglement, particularly through Bell inequality violations, continue to refine our understanding of quantum mechanics and its implications for reality.  These advancements drive the development of quantum technologies with transformative potential in various fields.
