Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the interplay of the strong nuclear force, binding nucleons together, and the Coulomb repulsion between protons.  Quantum tunneling plays a crucial role, allowing the nucleus to overcome the potential energy barrier separating it from a fissioned state even when its energy is insufficient classically. The wavefunction of the nucleus, described by a many-body Schr√∂dinger equation (though computationally intractable for heavy nuclei), contains a non-zero probability amplitude for configurations corresponding to separated fragments.  This probability is amplified by collective vibrational and rotational modes within the nucleus, often initiated by neutron absorption, which deform the nucleus and reduce the potential barrier.  The subsequent fission process is not deterministic; rather, it exhibits a range of possible fragment mass distributions, governed by the complex interplay of nuclear shell effects and the minimization of the total energy of the system.  These fragment mass distributions, along with the emission of prompt neutrons, reflect the underlying quantum probabilities associated with different final states accessible within the confines of energy and momentum conservation.  Consequently, a complete understanding of fission necessitates a sophisticated quantum mechanical treatment, often relying on statistical models and approximations due to the inherent complexity of the many-body problem.
