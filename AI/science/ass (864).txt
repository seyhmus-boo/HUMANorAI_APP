Nuclear fission is the process where a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and neutrons.  This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the daughter nuclei is less than the parent nucleus, the difference converted to energy according to Einstein's E=mcÂ².  The released neutrons can trigger further fission events, creating a chain reaction, the basis of nuclear power generation and weaponry.

Recent developments in fission research primarily focus on enhancing efficiency and safety.  Advances in reactor design, such as the development of Generation IV reactors, aim to improve fuel utilization, reduce waste production, and enhance safety features through passive safety mechanisms.  Research into Accelerator Driven Subcritical Systems (ADSS) explores using particle accelerators to induce fission in a subcritical mass, potentially leading to improved fuel burnup and reduced proliferation risks.  Furthermore, ongoing research investigates the use of thorium-based fuels, which offer potentially greater resource availability and reduced waste compared to uranium.  These advancements strive to mitigate the environmental and safety concerns associated with conventional fission technologies while harnessing the significant energy potential of nuclear fission.
