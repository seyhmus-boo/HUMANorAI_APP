Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a cornerstone of energy production and scientific inquiry.  While its fundamental principles have been understood for decades, recent developments continue to refine our understanding and expand its potential applications. This paper explores the intricacies of nuclear fission processes, focusing on advancements in several key areas.  Specifically, we will examine recent progress in the development of advanced reactor designs,  notably those focusing on enhanced safety features and improved fuel utilization, such as Generation IV reactors and small modular reactors (SMRs).  Furthermore, we will discuss the ongoing research into improved methods for nuclear waste management, encompassing strategies for transmutation and the development of more efficient separation techniques.  Finally, the paper will address the significant advancements in computational modelling and simulation, allowing for more accurate predictions of fission processes and ultimately contributing to safer and more efficient reactor designs.  These advancements collectively represent a significant shift towards a more sustainable and robust nuclear energy sector, mitigating some of the long-standing concerns associated with this powerful technology.
