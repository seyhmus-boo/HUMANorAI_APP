Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them promising materials for a wide range of applications.  This presentation will explore the key characteristics of CNTs, focusing on their remarkable strength and stiffness arising from their spÂ² hybridized carbon structure.  We will discuss the diverse electrical properties, encompassing both metallic and semiconducting behaviours depending on chirality and diameter, enabling their use in advanced electronics.  Furthermore, the high thermal conductivity of CNTs will be highlighted, crucial for thermal management in various devices.

The presentation will delve into the challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and processing, and will outline current strategies for overcoming these obstacles.  Finally, we will examine the diverse practical applications of CNTs, encompassing their use in high-strength composites for aerospace and automotive industries, transparent conductive films for flexible electronics, energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors, and advanced sensors. The potential of CNTs to revolutionize multiple technological sectors will be discussed, emphasizing the ongoing research and development efforts aimed at realizing their full potential.
