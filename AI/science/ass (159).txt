Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon of quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, irrespective of the spatial separation between them.  This non-classical correlation surpasses classical correlations, manifesting in strong violations of Bell inequalities.  Recent developments significantly enhance our understanding and application of this bizarre effect.  Advances in experimental techniques, particularly involving trapped ions and superconducting circuits, have allowed for the creation and manipulation of entangled states in increasingly complex systems, including the generation of multi-qubit entangled states exhibiting high fidelity.  Theoretically, progress in developing quantum error correction codes leverages entanglement to improve the robustness of quantum computations, mitigating the effects of decoherence.  Furthermore, research into entanglement witnesses provides refined methods for experimental verification and quantification of entanglement, moving beyond simple Bell inequality tests.  The burgeoning field of quantum networks utilizes entanglement for secure communication protocols, such as quantum key distribution, demonstrating practical applications with increased range and security.  Despite ongoing challenges, these advancements suggest a future where entanglement forms the backbone of transformative technologies in quantum computing and communication.
