The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their unique quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp²-hybridized carbon atoms form a seamless cylindrical lattice, resulting in a delocalized π-electron system extending along the nanotube axis.  This extended π-system gives rise to high electrical conductivity, with the conductivity exhibiting significant dependence on the nanotube's chirality, which dictates the band structure.  Armchair nanotubes possess a metallic band structure due to the presence of a zero band gap, while zigzag and chiral nanotubes can exhibit either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chiral angle, reflecting the quantized nature of their electronic states.  Furthermore, the strong covalent bonds within the hexagonal lattice contribute to exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, exceeding that of steel.  Quantum confinement effects become significant for smaller diameter nanotubes, influencing their electronic and optical properties, leading to observable band gap variations and altered excitation energies.  The unique combination of these quantum mechanically determined properties renders CNTs highly promising materials for a wide range of applications in electronics, materials science, and nanotechnology.
