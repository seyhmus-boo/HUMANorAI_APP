Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is a process underpinned by the strong and weak nuclear forces.  Historically, its discovery in 1938 by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, interpreted by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, revolutionized physics and engineering.  The process releases a significant amount of energy, stemming from the mass defect according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mc²).  This energy release arises because the binding energy per nucleon is higher in the lighter daughter nuclei compared to the original heavy nucleus.

Fission can be induced by bombarding fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with neutrons.  The absorption of a neutron destabilizes the nucleus, leading to its fission.  This process, however, typically yields further neutrons, creating the potential for a chain reaction. The number of neutrons released per fission event, alongside the probability of neutron absorption, dictates the criticality of the system – whether the chain reaction is self-sustaining. This principle underpins both nuclear reactors, which control the chain reaction for sustained energy production, and nuclear weapons, where the aim is an uncontrolled, rapidly escalating chain reaction.
