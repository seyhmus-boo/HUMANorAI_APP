Despite the remarkable theoretical properties predicted for carbon nanotubes (CNTs), their experimental characterization presents significant challenges.  Precise control over nanotube chirality, diameter, and length during synthesis remains elusive, leading to heterogeneous samples that complicate accurate property measurement.  This inherent polydispersity necessitates sophisticated separation techniques, such as density gradient ultracentrifugation or chromatography, which are often time-consuming and yield only limited quantities of purified material.  Furthermore, accurately measuring mechanical properties, like tensile strength, requires the development of specialized testing methodologies capable of gripping and manipulating individual nanotubes without causing damage.  Similarly, characterizing the electronic properties, such as band gap, is hindered by the challenges in precisely controlling the CNT's structure and eliminating the influence of defects and impurities.  The strong van der Waals forces between nanotubes also complicate measurements, affecting the observed macroscopic behavior and requiring careful sample preparation to minimize inter-tube interactions.  Overcoming these experimental hurdles is crucial for unlocking the full potential of CNTs in diverse technological applications.
