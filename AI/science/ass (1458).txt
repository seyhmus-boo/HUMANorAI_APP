Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, promises transformative applications in quantum computing and communication. However, realizing its full potential faces significant experimental challenges. This presentation focuses on the key hurdles in harnessing entanglement for practical use. We will examine the fragility of entangled states to decoherence, arising from interactions with the environment, emphasizing the need for advanced isolation techniques like cryogenics and sophisticated shielding.  The generation of high-fidelity entangled states, particularly for multi-qubit systems, remains a significant bottleneck. We will discuss progress in various approaches, including photon-based entanglement, trapped ion systems, and superconducting qubits, highlighting their respective strengths and weaknesses in achieving high entanglement fidelity and scalability.  Furthermore, the efficient and reliable manipulation and measurement of entangled states present considerable technological obstacles. We will address the need for improved control techniques and detectors with high efficiency and minimal noise. Finally, the presentation will briefly outline current research directions aimed at overcoming these experimental challenges and paving the way for robust and scalable entangled quantum systems.
