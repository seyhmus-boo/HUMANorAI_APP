Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit a unique combination of properties that underpin their diverse potential applications.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, with tensile strength significantly exceeding that of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility and high elasticity, makes them ideal for reinforcement in composite materials.  Their high aspect ratio and unique electronic structure lead to exceptional electrical conductivity, surpassing that of copper in some configurations, while others exhibit semiconducting behaviour, crucial for nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, CNTs possess high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation in devices.  These properties are exploited in various applications.  In materials science, CNTs enhance the strength and stiffness of polymers and metals.  In electronics, they are explored for high-performance transistors and interconnects.  Their high surface area facilitates their use in energy storage devices, such as supercapacitors and batteries, while their biocompatibility opens avenues in biomedical engineering, including drug delivery and biosensors. However, challenges remain, including scalability of production, dispersion in composite matrices, and precise control over their electronic properties for widespread technological implementation.
