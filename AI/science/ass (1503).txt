Catalysts play a pivotal role in advancing organic chemistry, enabling reactions that would otherwise be kinetically inaccessible or proceed with undesirable selectivity. This lecture explores the diverse applications of catalysts in organic synthesis, focusing on their mechanistic modes of action and impact on reaction efficiency.  We examine homogeneous catalysts, such as transition metal complexes, which interact directly with reactants in solution, highlighting their ability to activate substrates through coordination and redox processes.  Furthermore, the lecture will cover heterogeneous catalysts, including zeolites and metal nanoparticles, emphasizing their advantages in terms of recyclability and ease of separation from reaction mixtures.  The influence of catalyst design on reaction selectivity and yield will be discussed, with particular attention paid to the principles of chirality and asymmetric catalysis for the synthesis of enantiomerically pure compounds.  Finally, current trends in catalyst development, including the burgeoning field of biocatalysis, will be briefly reviewed, illustrating the ongoing pursuit of more sustainable and efficient catalytic strategies in organic synthesis.
