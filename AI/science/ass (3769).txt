Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  Early theoretical groundwork, laid by Laplace and Michell in the 18th century, postulated "dark stars" based on Newtonian gravity.  However, a rigorous understanding emerged only with the advent of Einstein's General Relativity in the early 20th century, which predicted the existence of singularities – points of infinite density – within spacetime.  

The process itself is complex and depends crucially on stellar mass and composition.  Stars with initial masses exceeding approximately 20-30 solar masses exhaust their nuclear fuel, leading to core collapse.  This collapse is initially resisted by electron degeneracy pressure, but for sufficiently massive cores, this pressure is overcome, resulting in a runaway implosion.  If the core mass surpasses the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), no known force can halt the collapse, yielding a black hole.  Alternatively, binary systems involving neutron stars can merge, leading to direct black hole formation.  The resulting black hole's properties, such as mass and spin, are determined by the progenitor star(s) and the dynamics of the collapse, posing ongoing challenges for observational and numerical studies.
