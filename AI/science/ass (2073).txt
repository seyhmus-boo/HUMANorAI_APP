Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, represents the ultimate fate of sufficiently massive stars.  Early theoretical predictions, stemming from the work of Laplace and Michell in the 18th century, posited the existence of objects so dense that light could not escape their gravitational pull.  Einstein's General Theory of Relativity, however, provided the rigorous framework for understanding black holes as singularities in spacetime, arising from the gravitational collapse of stellar cores.  Observations of stellar-mass black holes, initially inferred through their gravitational influence on companion stars in binary systems, have been confirmed via gravitational wave detection by LIGO and Virgo, providing direct evidence of black hole mergers and formation through supernovae.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, present a more complex formation scenario, possibly involving direct collapse of massive gas clouds, mergers of smaller black holes, or a combination thereof.  Ongoing research focuses on refining theoretical models,  improving observational techniques (e.g., Event Horizon Telescope), and understanding the diverse pathways leading to black hole formation across the mass spectrum, bridging the gap between stellar-mass and supermassive systems.
