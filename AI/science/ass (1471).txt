Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential across diverse applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains elusive, leading to heterogeneous samples with variations in diameter, length, chirality, and defects, which drastically affect their properties.  Characterizing these variations accurately is another hurdle; advanced techniques such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) and Raman spectroscopy are necessary, but often lack the throughput for large-scale analysis.

Furthermore, the inherent tendency of CNTs to agglomerate due to strong van der Waals forces complicates their processing and integration into devices.  Dispersing CNTs effectively in solvents or matrices while maintaining their individual properties requires careful selection of surfactants and processing methods.  Finally, the precise measurement of key properties, such as tensile strength and thermal conductivity, is often confounded by sample imperfections and limitations in measurement techniques.  Overcoming these experimental challenges through the development of improved synthesis, characterization, and processing techniques is crucial for the widespread adoption of CNTs in technological applications.
