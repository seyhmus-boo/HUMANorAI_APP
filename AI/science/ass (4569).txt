DNA replication is a fundamental process in all living organisms, ensuring the faithful transmission of genetic information during cell division.  This semi-conservative process involves the unwinding of the parental DNA double helix by enzymes such as helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-stranded binding proteins prevent re-annealing, while DNA primase synthesizes short RNA primers providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate synthesis.  DNA polymerase III adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, forming Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, creating a continuous strand.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases.  The accuracy of DNA replication is crucial for genomic stability and prevents mutations that could lead to disease.  Understanding the intricacies of DNA replication has yielded significant practical applications, including advancements in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology for DNA amplification in diagnostics and forensic science, and the development of novel anti-cancer drugs targeting specific enzymes involved in the replication process.  Further research continues to unravel the complexities of this essential biological mechanism.
