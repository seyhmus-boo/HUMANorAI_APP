Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties rendering them promising candidates for diverse technological applications.  This presentation will explore the key characteristics underpinning their potential.  We will examine their remarkable mechanical strength, stemming from the strong spÂ²-hybridized carbon bonds within their hexagonal lattice structure, resulting in high tensile strength and Young's modulus.  Their electrical properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, will be discussed, highlighting their potential for nanoelectronics.  The exceptionally high thermal conductivity of CNTs, exceeding that of copper, will be examined in the context of thermal management applications.  Furthermore, their large surface area and unique surface chemistry will be considered, detailing their applicability in areas such as catalysis and sensing.  Finally, we will briefly address current challenges in the large-scale production and manipulation of CNTs, focusing on purification and dispersion techniques to fully unlock their potential in various fields. This presentation aims to provide a concise overview of the fundamental properties of CNTs, emphasizing their remarkable versatility and future prospects.
