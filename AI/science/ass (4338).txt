DNA replication, a fundamental process in all living organisms, ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information across generations.  This semiconservative mechanism involves unwinding of the parental double helix by helicases, creating a replication fork.  Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the separated strands, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH terminus for DNA polymerase III, the principal enzyme responsible for elongating the new DNA strand in a 5' to 3' direction.  Leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously, while lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously, generating Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, resulting in two identical daughter DNA molecules.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity inherent to DNA polymerases and various repair mechanisms correcting errors introduced during replication.  Understanding the intricacies of DNA replication is crucial for comprehending genome stability, mutagenesis, and the development of targeted therapeutic interventions.
