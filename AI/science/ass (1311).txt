Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon central to the foundations of quantum mechanics, describes a peculiar correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical intuition, exhibiting stronger-than-classical correlations that persist even when the entangled particles are spatially separated.  The theoretical groundwork for entanglement was laid in the 1930s, arising from the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox, which challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics by highlighting the seemingly paradoxical implications of entangled states.  EPR argued that the seemingly instantaneous correlation between separated particles suggested the existence of "hidden variables" determining the outcome of measurements, thus implying incompleteness in the quantum mechanical description.

However, subsequent work, notably Bell's theorem in the 1960s, provided a framework for experimentally testing the predictions of quantum mechanics against local realism, the worldview championed by EPR.  Bell's inequalities, derived from the assumption of local realism, were demonstrably violated in numerous experiments, solidifying the reality of quantum entanglement and demonstrating the failure of classical intuitions in the quantum realm.  This paper will explore the fundamental aspects of quantum entanglement, delve into its implications for quantum information science, and critically examine ongoing debates surrounding its interpretation and its potential for technological applications.
