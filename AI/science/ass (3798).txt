Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have garnered significant interdisciplinary research interest.  Their unique nanoscale dimensions, coupled with their tunable electronic characteristics (metallic or semiconducting), position them as prime candidates for a wide range of applications spanning materials science, electronics, energy storage, and biomedical engineering.  This paper explores the multifaceted properties of CNTs, highlighting the crucial interplay between their structural characteristics and resulting functionalities.  We will examine the influence of chirality and diameter on electrical conductivity, tensile strength, and thermal conductivity, demonstrating the intricate relationship between atomic-scale arrangements and macroscopic behaviour.  Furthermore, we will analyze the interdisciplinary links that arise from these properties, focusing on their integration into composite materials for enhanced mechanical performance, their application in next-generation electronics, their role in energy storage devices such as supercapacitors and batteries, and their potential in targeted drug delivery systems.  By examining these diverse applications, we aim to provide a comprehensive overview of the ongoing efforts to harness the unique potential of CNTs across multiple scientific and engineering fields.
