Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a cornerstone of energy production and scientific inquiry. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the underlying processes governing nuclear fission, encompassing both spontaneous and induced fission mechanisms.  We examine the key factors influencing fission dynamics, including the interplay between nuclear structure, shell effects, and the influence of incident particle energy and type.  Particular emphasis is placed on the crucial role of the nuclear potential energy landscape in determining fission fragment mass and charge distributions, and the associated release of energy and neutrons.  The theoretical frameworks employed to describe these complex processes, ranging from macroscopic models like the liquid drop model to microscopic approaches incorporating shell corrections, are critically reviewed.  Furthermore, we address the practical implications of our understanding of fission, including its relevance to reactor design and the challenges associated with nuclear waste management.  Ultimately, this work aims to consolidate existing knowledge and highlight areas requiring further research to enhance our predictive capabilities and control over fission processes.
