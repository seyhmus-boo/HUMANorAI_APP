Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of spatial separation, presents significant experimental challenges.  The primary hurdle lies in maintaining the fragile coherence of entangled states.  Environmental interactions, such as decoherence due to thermal noise or stray electromagnetic fields, rapidly destroy entanglement, limiting the duration and fidelity of entangled systems.  This necessitates meticulous control over experimental parameters, including temperature, vacuum conditions, and shielding from external perturbations.

Furthermore, generating and verifying entanglement requires highly sensitive and precise measurement techniques.  Detecting subtle correlations between entangled particles often necessitates low-noise detectors operating at cryogenic temperatures. The efficient creation of entangled states, particularly for multiple particles, also presents a significant technological challenge, demanding sophisticated sources and manipulation techniques.  Finally, scaling up entanglement experiments for applications in quantum computing or communication faces the formidable task of maintaining entanglement across a large number of qubits, a problem exacerbated by increasing vulnerability to decoherence with system size.  Overcoming these experimental limitations is crucial for realizing the potential of entanglement-based technologies.
