DNA replication is a semiconservative process ensuring the accurate duplication of the genome before cell division.  Initiation involves unwinding of the double helix at origins of replication by helicases, stabilized by single-stranded binding proteins.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, which adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to the formation of leading and lagging strands. The lagging strand's discontinuous synthesis generates Okazaki fragments, joined by DNA ligase after removal of RNA primers by DNA polymerase I.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and mismatch repair mechanisms.  Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, address the replication problem posed by lagging strand synthesis.

Understanding DNA replication is crucial for various applications.  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology exploits the principles of DNA replication for in vitro amplification of specific DNA sequences, vital in diagnostics and forensic science.  Further, advancements in understanding replication fidelity have informed cancer research, with defects in DNA replication contributing to genomic instability and tumorigenesis.  Moreover, manipulating DNA replication mechanisms holds potential for gene therapy strategies and the development of novel anti-cancer drugs targeting replication enzymes.
