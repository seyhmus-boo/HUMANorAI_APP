DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is crucial for cellular proliferation and inheritance.  This semiconservative mechanism ensures each daughter cell receives an identical copy.  Initiation involves the unwinding of the double helix at origin sites by helicases, stabilized by single-strand binding proteins.  DNA polymerase, the primary enzyme, synthesizes new strands in a 5' to 3' direction, utilizing the existing strands as templates.  The leading strand is synthesized continuously, while the lagging strand is produced discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers to initiate DNA polymerase activity on both strands.  DNA ligase then joins these fragments.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms intrinsic to DNA polymerase and post-replicative mismatch repair systems.  Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, require telomerase for complete replication, protecting against chromosomal shortening.  Errors in replication can lead to mutations and genomic instability, contributing to various pathologies.  Comprehensive understanding of DNA replication is fundamental to fields such as oncology and genetic engineering.
