Good morning. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission, the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy.  This energy release, governed by the strong and weak nuclear forces, stems from the mass defect between the parent nucleus and its fission products.  Historically, uranium-235 has been the primary fissile isotope utilised, inducing chain reactions in nuclear reactors and weapons.

Recent developments, however, are exploring alternative pathways.  Research into fast neutron reactors, capable of utilizing depleted uranium and thorium, is gaining traction, offering enhanced fuel efficiency and reduced waste proliferation.  Furthermore, advancements in accelerator-driven subcritical systems are showing promise in significantly improving safety and waste management.  These systems, using accelerators to induce fission in a subcritical mass of fuel, offer greater control and potentially reduced risks associated with conventional reactor designs.  Finally, ongoing investigations into advanced fuel cycles and innovative reactor designs aim to enhance the overall sustainability and safety of nuclear fission as a power source.
