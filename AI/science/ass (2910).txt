Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  Imagine a single sheet of graphite, a honeycomb lattice of carbon atoms, rolled into a seamless cylinder. This, essentially, is a CNT.  Their unique structure underpins their exceptional characteristics.

Firstly, their **high tensile strength**, exceeding that of steel, can be visualised as incredibly strong, microscopic ropes. This is due to the strong sp<sup>2</sup> hybridised carbon bonds forming the hexagonal lattice.  Secondly, CNTs exhibit **exceptional electrical conductivity**, acting like minuscule, highly efficient wires.  Think of electrons flowing unimpeded through this perfectly structured atomic highway.  Thirdly, their **thermal conductivity** rivals that of diamond, making them excellent heat dissipators; imagine them as microscopic heat sinks. Finally, depending on their chirality (the angle of the rolling), CNTs can exhibit either metallic or semiconducting behaviour, offering versatility analogous to switching between different types of wires. These remarkable properties position CNTs as transformative materials in diverse fields.
