Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise across diverse technological sectors.  However, realizing their full potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges, hindering both the precise characterization of their inherent properties and their effective integration into functional devices.  This paper focuses on the key experimental obstacles encountered in the study of CNT properties.  The inherent heterogeneity of CNT samples, encompassing variations in diameter, chirality, and structural defects, presents a major hurdle in obtaining reliable and reproducible measurements.  Furthermore, the precise control and manipulation of individual nanotubes, essential for probing their intrinsic properties, remain technically demanding.  This necessitates the development and refinement of advanced characterization techniques such as high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), Raman spectroscopy, and scanning probe microscopy, coupled with sophisticated sample preparation and purification methods.  Additionally, the difficulties in achieving large-scale, high-quality synthesis of CNTs with controlled characteristics pose a considerable challenge for practical applications.  This research paper will critically review these experimental limitations, exploring current methodologies and potential avenues for overcoming them to unlock the full potential of CNTs.
