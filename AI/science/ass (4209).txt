Catalysts are indispensable tools in modern organic synthesis, enabling efficient and selective transformations unattainable via stoichiometric methods.  This presentation will survey recent advancements in catalyst design and application within organic chemistry, focusing on key areas of progress.  We will explore the burgeoning field of photoredox catalysis, highlighting its unique ability to mediate challenging redox reactions with high efficiency and selectivity under mild conditions.  Furthermore, the continued development and application of organocatalysis, particularly utilizing N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) and chiral phosphoric acids, will be discussed, emphasizing their environmental benefits and ability to access complex molecular architectures.  Advances in the design of transition metal catalysts, including single-site heterogeneous catalysts and the use of earth-abundant metals, will also be examined, addressing current sustainability concerns in chemical synthesis. Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the emerging area of biocatalysis and its synergistic potential with traditional catalytic methods, illustrating the expanding possibilities for innovative and sustainable synthetic strategies.  The overarching aim is to provide a concise overview of the dynamic landscape of catalysis in organic chemistry and its crucial role in addressing current challenges in chemical synthesis.
