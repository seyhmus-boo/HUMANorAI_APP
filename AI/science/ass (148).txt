Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of atomic orbitals, specifically their overlap and the subsequent decrease in total energy.  Quantum mechanical principles dictate that electrons occupy molecular orbitals (MOs), formed through linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAOs).  The stability of a molecule is determined by the occupation of bonding MOs, which are lower in energy than the constituent atomic orbitals, and the relative contributions of bonding and antibonding MOs.

The spatial distribution of electrons within MOs dictates the molecular geometry.  Repulsion between electron pairs, both bonding and lone pairs, as described by Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, is a manifestation of the Pauli exclusion principle and the Coulombic interactions within the molecule.  Advanced computational methods, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Hartree-Fock methods, leverage quantum mechanical principles to predict molecular geometries and properties with increasingly high accuracy, providing insights beyond simplified models like VSEPR.  Ultimately, the observed molecular structure is a direct consequence of the quantum mechanical behavior of electrons within the molecule.
