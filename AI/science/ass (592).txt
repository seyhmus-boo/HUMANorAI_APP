Black hole formation, while classically understood through gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, gains a richer perspective through a quantum mechanical lens.  The process begins with the stellar core's exhaustion of nuclear fuel, leading to gravitational instability.  As the core collapses, the increasing density and curvature of spacetime necessitate a quantum description, particularly near the singularity.  Quantum fluctuations, inherent to the uncertainty principle, play a crucial role, potentially influencing the singularity's structure and preventing the formation of a classical point singularity.  

The immense gravitational field influences particle creation via Hawking radiation, a quantum effect where virtual particle-antiparticle pairs near the event horizon are separated, with one escaping and the other falling in. This process, while seemingly gradual, suggests a gradual erosion of the black hole's mass and a potential "information paradox" regarding the fate of information swallowed by the black hole.  A complete quantum theory of gravity, potentially incorporating concepts like loop quantum gravity or string theory, is required to fully understand the interplay between quantum fluctuations, spacetime curvature, and the final stages of black hole formation and evaporation.
