Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional structural and electronic properties, have garnered significant attention within the scientific community since their discovery.  Their unique combination of high tensile strength, remarkable flexibility, and exceptional electrical and thermal conductivity surpasses that of many conventional materials, prompting extensive research into their potential applications across diverse fields.  This paper aims to comprehensively review the fundamental properties of CNTs, encompassing their structural characteristics (single-walled versus multi-walled), mechanical behavior, electronic properties, and thermal characteristics.  A key focus will be on elucidating the relationship between structural features and resultant macroscopic properties.  Furthermore, we will explore the practical implications of these properties, examining established and emerging applications, including their use in advanced composites for aerospace and automotive industries, high-performance electronics such as transistors and sensors, energy storage devices like batteries and supercapacitors, and biomedical applications such as drug delivery and tissue engineering.  The review concludes by highlighting current challenges and future research directions within the field of CNT research and development.
