Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  Early theoretical work, notably by Laplace and Michell in the late 18th century, posited the existence of objects so dense that light could not escape, though lacking the context of general relativity.  Einstein's theory, published in 1915, provided the rigorous framework for understanding black hole formation, predicting the existence of singularities and event horizons.  

The process begins with a star's core exhausting its nuclear fuel, leading to gravitational instability. For stars exceeding approximately three solar masses, the core's self-gravity overcomes degeneracy pressure, resulting in an unstoppable collapse.  Depending on the star's initial mass and rotation, this collapse forms either a stellar-mass black hole, typically with a mass ranging from a few to tens of solar masses, or a rapidly rotating Kerr black hole.  Alternatively, supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, likely originate from the accretion of gas and the merging of smaller black holes over cosmological timescales, although their initial formation mechanism remains a subject of active research.  Observational evidence supporting black hole formation includes gravitational wave detections from merging black holes and the detection of highly redshifted light from matter accreting onto these enigmatic objects.
