DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning life's continuity, has captivated scientists since the discovery of the double helix structure.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of this intricate molecular mechanism, tracing its historical understanding from the seminal work of Watson and Crick in 1953, which posited a semi-conservative model, to our current sophisticated knowledge.  We will explore the key players involved, including DNA polymerases, helicases, primases, and topoisomerases, detailing their respective roles in unwinding the parental duplex, primer synthesis, leading and lagging strand synthesis, and proofreading mechanisms.  The presentation will highlight the remarkable fidelity of replication, crucial for genomic stability, and briefly address the challenges posed by replication at telomeres and origins of replication.  Finally, we will touch upon recent advancements in understanding replication dynamics and their implications for fields such as cancer biology and biotechnology, emphasizing the enduring relevance of this foundational biological process.  The presentation aims to provide a comprehensive, yet accessible, overview of DNA replication for a broad scientific audience.
