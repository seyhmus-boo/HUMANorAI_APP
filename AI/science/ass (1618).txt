Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, have garnered significant attention for diverse applications.  This presentation will overview the fundamental properties of CNTs, differentiating between single-walled (SWCNTs) and multi-walled (MWCNTs) architectures and their impact on material characteristics. We will explore their remarkable tensile strength, high aspect ratio, and tunable electronic properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour depending on chirality.  Recent advances in controlled synthesis techniques, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and laser ablation, allowing for precise control over diameter, length, and chirality, will be discussed. Furthermore, the presentation will highlight emerging research focusing on functionalization strategies to enhance CNT dispersion and integration into composite materials.  Specific examples will be provided showcasing the latest applications in high-performance composites, energy storage devices, and biomedical sensors.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the remaining challenges and future prospects for realizing the full potential of CNTs across various technological domains, particularly addressing scalability and cost-effectiveness issues.
