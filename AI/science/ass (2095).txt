Nuclear fission, the process of a heavy atomic nucleus splitting into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing substantial energy in the process, has been predominantly understood through classical physics models.  However, a complete and accurate description requires a quantum mechanical framework. This paper delves into the quantum mechanical underpinnings of nuclear fission, moving beyond the simplified liquid drop model often employed.  We will explore the crucial role of quantum tunneling in overcoming the Coulomb barrier, a process essential for initiating the fission reaction.  Furthermore, we will examine the influence of quantum shell effects on the fission fragment mass distribution, highlighting the deviations from statistical predictions observed experimentally.  The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, specifically concerning the wave functions of nucleons and their interactions, will be central to our analysis.  By focusing on the quantum mechanical aspects, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the intricacies of the fission process, addressing the limitations of classical models and advancing our comprehension of the nuclear landscape.  The paper will conclude by outlining potential areas for future research in applying advanced quantum mechanical techniques to refine our predictive capabilities in this crucial field.
