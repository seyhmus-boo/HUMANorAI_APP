Chemical bonding and molecular structure find their rigorous explanation within the framework of quantum mechanics.  The fundamental principle lies in the decrease of the overall system energy when atoms interact, a consequence of the wave-like nature of electrons.  Instead of orbiting nuclei in defined paths as in classical models, electrons exist in molecular orbitals, which are solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation for the entire molecule.  These molecular orbitals are formed through linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO), resulting in bonding orbitals, characterized by increased electron density between nuclei, and antibonding orbitals, exhibiting decreased electron density in the internuclear region.  The occupancy of these molecular orbitals by electrons, governed by the Pauli Exclusion Principle and Hund's rule, dictates the bond order and, consequently, the bond length and strength.  The spatial distribution of electrons within the molecular orbitals further determines the overall molecular geometry, which can be predicted using valence bond theory or molecular orbital theory, both underpinned by quantum mechanical principles.  Ultimately, the stability and reactivity of a molecule are intimately tied to the specific arrangements of electrons within its molecular orbitals.
