Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, promising revolutionary advancements across diverse fields.  However, realizing the full potential of CNTs remains hampered by significant experimental challenges.  This research paper examines the key experimental limitations encountered in characterizing and manipulating CNTs, focusing on their inherent heterogeneity.  The precise control over diameter, chirality, and length, crucial for tailoring material properties, remains elusive, leading to batch-to-batch variations in observed characteristics.  Furthermore, accurate characterization of these properties is complicated by the presence of impurities, such as amorphous carbon and metallic catalysts, often introduced during synthesis.  Techniques such as Raman spectroscopy, electron microscopy, and various chromatographic methods offer partial solutions, yet often struggle to provide comprehensive, statistically relevant data on individual nanotube properties within a larger sample.  This paper will critically evaluate these experimental hurdles, highlighting recent methodological advancements and suggesting future research directions towards overcoming these limitations and enabling the widespread practical application of CNTs.
