Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of atomic orbitals, described by wavefunctions, leading to a lower overall energy state for the system.  The Pauli Exclusion Principle dictates that only two electrons can occupy a single molecular orbital, with opposite spins.  Molecular orbitals (MOs) are formed via linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAOs), resulting in bonding MOs (lower energy, increased electron density between nuclei) and antibonding MOs (higher energy, decreased electron density between nuclei).

The number and type of bonds formed determine the molecule's geometry.  The valence bond (VB) theory provides a simplified picture, invoking the overlap of atomic orbitals to form localized bonds. Conversely, molecular orbital (MO) theory offers a more sophisticated description, representing the electrons as delocalized across the entire molecule.  Both approaches predict molecular geometries based on minimizing electron-electron and electron-nuclear repulsions while maximizing attractive forces, often reflecting principles of hybridization and VSEPR theory.  The resulting molecular structure significantly influences the molecule's physical and chemical properties.
