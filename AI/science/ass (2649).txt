Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, remains a significant challenge at the interface of general relativity and quantum mechanics.  While classical general relativity predicts the collapse of sufficiently massive stars into singularities, a complete understanding requires incorporating quantum effects, particularly near the event horizon.  This abstract explores the quantum mechanical aspects of black hole formation, focusing on the potential role of Hawking radiation and its implications for information paradox resolution.  The semi-classical approach, incorporating quantum field theory on a curved spacetime background, reveals the emission of thermal radiation from the black hole, seemingly violating unitarity.  However, proposed solutions involving quantum entanglement between Hawking radiation and the black hole interior, or modifications to quantum gravity near the Planck scale, suggest potential resolutions.  Understanding the quantum nature of spacetime near the singularity remains crucial, with ongoing research exploring loop quantum gravity and string theory as potential frameworks for a complete quantum theory of gravity, necessary for a definitive description of black hole formation and evaporation.  Further investigation into these areas is vital for resolving fundamental open questions about black hole thermodynamics and the information paradox.
