Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, exhibit exceptional material properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices.  These properties are heavily dependent on both diameter and chirality (the helical arrangement of the carbon atoms), leading to a broad spectrum of potential applications.  CNTs possess extraordinarily high tensile strength, significantly exceeding that of steel, while maintaining remarkably low density.  Their electrical conductivity varies considerably depending on chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, offering versatility in electronic applications.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate exceptional thermal conductivity along their axial direction, surpassing that of many metals.  This combination of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity renders them attractive for a diverse range of technological applications, including reinforcement in composite materials, nanoelectronics, energy storage devices, and sensors.  However, challenges remain, particularly in terms of scalable, cost-effective production and the dispersion of CNTs within composite matrices to fully exploit their unique properties.
