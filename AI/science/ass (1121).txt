Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding. This presentation explores the multifaceted pathways leading to black hole genesis, highlighting crucial links between astrophysics, nuclear physics, and computational science.  We will examine the stellar-mass black hole formation via core-collapse supernovae, emphasizing the interplay between stellar evolution models informed by nuclear reaction networks and the hydrodynamical simulations crucial for accurately modelling the supernova explosion and remnant properties.  The formation of supermassive black holes, still shrouded in considerable mystery, will be discussed, acknowledging the crucial role of both direct collapse scenarios and the accretion of stellar-mass black holes within dense galactic environments. This necessitates linking observations from across the electromagnetic spectrum with sophisticated simulations incorporating general relativity and magnetohydrodynamics.  Finally, we will briefly explore the nascent field of gravitational wave astronomy and its transformative impact on our understanding of black hole mergers and their implications for stellar and galactic evolution, further reinforcing the inherent interdisciplinary nature of this field.  The presentation aims to highlight the ongoing progress and future directions in elucidating the formation of black holes, emphasizing the power of collaborative, interdisciplinary research.
