Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel, is attributed to the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheet forming the nanotube walls. This strength, crucial in materials science, intersects with nanoscale engineering for applications like reinforcement composites.  

Electrically, CNTs display fascinating duality. Single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) can be metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality, influencing their potential in electronics and optoelectronics. This tunability, explored in physics and chemistry,  links to the development of next-generation transistors and sensors.  

Furthermore, the high surface area of CNTs, a crucial chemical property, facilitates their use in catalysis, energy storage, and biomedical applications.  The interactions of CNTs with biological systems, studied in biomedicine and toxicology, reveal their potential for drug delivery and tissue engineering, yet also pose challenges concerning their biocompatibility. Thus, understanding CNT properties necessitates an interdisciplinary approach encompassing materials science, physics, chemistry, and biology.
