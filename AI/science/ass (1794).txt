Plasma physics, the study of the fourth state of matter, encompasses a vast array of complex phenomena with significant implications across diverse fields, from controlled fusion energy to astrophysical modelling.  While theoretical advancements continue to refine our understanding of plasma behaviour, significant experimental challenges remain in accurately capturing and interpreting these phenomena. This paper addresses the key experimental difficulties encountered in studying plasma physics, focusing on three primary areas:  diagnosing highly transient and spatially inhomogeneous plasmas, controlling and isolating specific plasma parameters within complex systems, and accurately modelling the interplay between various interacting physical processes.  The inherent complexity of plasmas, characterised by collective interactions of charged particles and electromagnetic fields, demands sophisticated diagnostic techniques with high temporal and spatial resolution.  Furthermore, achieving the controlled environments necessary for isolating specific physical processes, especially in large-scale experiments like fusion reactors, presents a formidable engineering challenge.  This review will examine these challenges, highlighting recent advances in experimental techniques and identifying areas requiring further development to enhance our understanding of plasma physics.
