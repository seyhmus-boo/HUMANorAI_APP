Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  This abstract summarizes the quantum mechanical description of these phenomena, focusing on the role of electronic structure.  The Born-Oppenheimer approximation allows for the separation of nuclear and electronic motion, enabling the calculation of electronic wavefunctions and energy levels for various molecular geometries.  Molecular orbital theory, built upon the linear combination of atomic orbitals (LCAO) approach, provides a framework for understanding bonding through the constructive and destructive interference of atomic orbitals, leading to the formation of bonding, antibonding, and non-bonding orbitals.  The distribution of electron density within these orbitals dictates molecular shape and reactivity, as predicted by principles such as VSEPR theory, which is qualitatively explained by the Pauli exclusion principle and electron-electron repulsion.  Advanced computational methods, such as density functional theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock techniques, are crucial for accurately determining electronic structure and predicting properties of complex molecules beyond the scope of simpler models.  Understanding the quantum mechanical basis of bonding is essential for predicting and manipulating chemical reactions and designing novel materials.
