CRISPR-Cas systems, derived from prokaryotic adaptive immunity mechanisms, have revolutionized genetic engineering.  Their programmable nature, facilitated by guide RNA (gRNA) targeting specific DNA sequences, enables precise genome editing through the introduction of double-strand breaks (DSBs). These DSBs are subsequently repaired via non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), leading to insertions or deletions (indels) and gene disruption, or homology-directed repair (HDR), allowing precise gene replacement or insertion using a provided DNA template.  This versatility extends beyond gene knockout and knock-in; CRISPR-Cas systems have been adapted for base editing, enabling single nucleotide changes without DSB formation, and for transcriptional regulation through the fusion of Cas proteins with transcriptional activators or repressors.  The ease of design, high efficiency, and relatively low cost compared to previous gene editing technologies have made CRISPR-Cas a dominant tool across diverse fields, including biomedical research, agriculture, and biotechnology.  However, challenges remain, such as off-target effects, delivery efficiency, and ethical considerations surrounding germline editing, demanding ongoing refinement and responsible implementation of this powerful technology.
