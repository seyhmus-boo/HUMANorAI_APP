Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, defies classical intuition by exhibiting strong correlations between spatially separated quantum systems. This presentation will explore entanglement from a purely quantum mechanical perspective, focusing on its mathematical description and implications. We will begin by introducing the concept of composite quantum systems and their associated Hilbert spaces, emphasizing the crucial role of tensor products in representing entangled states.  The presentation will then delve into the characterization of entanglement, contrasting separable and entangled states using examples like Bell states and the density matrix formalism. We will discuss the violation of Bell inequalities as a crucial experimental signature, demonstrating the non-classical nature of entangled correlations.  Furthermore, we will briefly touch upon the quantification of entanglement, outlining different entanglement measures and their significance in quantum information science.  The presentation will conclude by highlighting the pivotal role of entanglement in emerging quantum technologies, including quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation, emphasizing its potential for revolutionizing information processing and communication.
