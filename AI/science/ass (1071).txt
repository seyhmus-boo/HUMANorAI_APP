Black hole formation is a cornerstone of astrophysical research, primarily stemming from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, the inward gravitational pressure surpasses the outward radiation pressure, initiating a catastrophic collapse.  If the stellar remnant's mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), no known force can counteract gravity, resulting in the formation of a singularity – a black hole.

Recent advancements refine our understanding of this process.  Numerical simulations with increasingly sophisticated equations of state are revealing the complex interplay of hydrodynamics, general relativity, and magnetic fields during the collapse.  These simulations are improving predictions of black hole masses and spin, and clarifying the dynamics of jets and outflows observed in some events.  Furthermore, gravitational wave astronomy, enabled by detectors like LIGO and Virgo, directly observes the merger of binary black holes, providing empirical data on black hole properties and the dynamics of these cataclysmic events.  The study of electromagnetic counterparts associated with these mergers further enriches our understanding of the late stages of black hole formation and their interaction with the surrounding environment.  These combined approaches are revolutionizing our understanding of black hole formation, moving beyond simple theoretical models toward a more nuanced, data-driven understanding.
