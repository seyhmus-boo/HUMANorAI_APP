The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime exhibiting such extreme gravitational pull that not even light can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical work by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, utilizing Einstein's newly formulated theory of general relativity, provided the first mathematical description of a black hole, albeit a non-rotating, uncharged model.  Subsequent developments, incorporating rotation (Kerr solution) and charge (Reissner-Nordström solution), broadened the theoretical understanding.  However, observational confirmation remained elusive for decades.  The prevailing consensus emerged that stellar-mass black holes form through the gravitational collapse of massive stars (≥20 solar masses) at the end of their lifecycle, following supernova explosions.  These remnants, exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit, lack sufficient internal pressure to resist their own gravity, inevitably collapsing into a singularity.  Supermassive black holes, millions or even billions of solar masses, residing at the centers of most galaxies, pose a more complex formation challenge.  Leading hypotheses involve the coalescence of smaller black holes through galactic mergers or the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe, though the exact mechanisms remain subjects of active research and debate.  The ongoing advancements in observational astronomy, particularly through gravitational wave detection and high-resolution imaging, are progressively refining our understanding of black hole formation across various scales.
