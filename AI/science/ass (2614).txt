DNA replication, the semiconservative process of duplicating a DNA molecule, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding emerged from the Meselson-Stahl experiment (1958), which definitively demonstrated the semiconservative mechanism – each new DNA molecule consists of one parental and one newly synthesized strand – refuting conservative and dispersive models.  This pivotal experiment built upon the prior discovery of the double helix structure by Watson and Crick (1953), which provided the structural basis for understanding replication.

The process itself is initiated at specific origins of replication, where DNA helicase unwinds the double helix, creating a replication fork. Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the unwound strands, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate DNA synthesis, which proceeds in a 5' to 3' direction continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, forming Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, completing the replication process.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases, ensuring the accurate transmission of genetic information across generations.
