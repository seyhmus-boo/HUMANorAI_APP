The formation of black holes, enigmatic objects predicted by Einstein's theory of general relativity, represents a dramatic endpoint in stellar evolution.  Early theoretical work by Schwarzschild in 1916 laid the groundwork, describing a singularity – a point of infinite density – at the heart of a sufficiently massive object. However, the concept remained largely theoretical until the 1960s, when observational evidence began to emerge.  

Primarily, stellar-mass black holes form from the gravitational collapse of massive stars, exceeding approximately three times the mass of our Sun.  Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel, these stars lack the internal pressure to counteract their own gravity.  This leads to an inexorable inward collapse, culminating in the formation of a singularity surrounded by an event horizon – the point of no return beyond which even light cannot escape. Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, likely originate from the coalescence of numerous stellar-mass black holes and the accretion of surrounding matter over cosmic timescales.  Further research continues to refine our understanding of the precise mechanisms and conditions leading to black hole formation across the observed mass spectrum.
