CRISPR-Cas systems, derived from bacterial adaptive immune systems, have revolutionized genetic engineering.  This lecture will explore the mechanism of action, focusing on the Cas9 enzyme guided by a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) to target specific DNA sequences.  The crRNA, designed to be complementary to the target gene, directs Cas9 to induce a double-stranded break (DSB).  Cellular repair mechanisms, namely non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) and homology-directed repair (HDR), are then leveraged to achieve gene knockout or gene editing respectively.  NHEJ, often error-prone, results in insertions or deletions, disrupting gene function.  HDR, utilizing a provided DNA template, facilitates precise gene correction or insertion.  The lecture will further address the versatility of CRISPR, including its application in diverse model organisms and its potential for treating genetic diseases.  Finally, ethical considerations surrounding its use, specifically off-target effects and potential for misuse, will be discussed.  The overall aim is to provide a comprehensive overview of CRISPR's capabilities and limitations within the field of genetic engineering.
