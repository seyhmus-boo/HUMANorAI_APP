Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, sharing the same fate regardless of spatial separation.  This correlation transcends classical physics; measuring a property of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the other, even at vast distances.  This "spooky action at a distance," as Einstein famously termed it, sparked intense debate following its theoretical prediction by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in 1935.  The EPR paradox challenged the completeness of quantum mechanics, arguing that the theory must be incomplete to account for seemingly instantaneous correlations.

Experimental verification of entanglement, beginning with Alain Aspect's experiments in the 1980s, decisively refuted the EPR argument, confirming the non-locality inherent in quantum mechanics. Entanglement arises from the superposition principle, where particles exist in a combined state until measurement collapses the wave function, instantaneously defining the properties of all entangled particles. This interconnectedness has profound implications for quantum computing and communication, offering potential for faster and more secure technologies.  However, the exact mechanism underlying entanglement remains a subject of ongoing research and philosophical debate.
