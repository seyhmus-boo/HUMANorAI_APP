Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical macromolecules composed entirely of carbon atoms, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties.  Their unique structure, analogous to a rolled-up sheet of graphene – a single layer of graphite – bestows upon them a combination of characteristics unparalleled in naturally occurring or synthetically produced materials. Imagine a single sheet of paper, possessing incredible tensile strength but also being remarkably flexible; now imagine rolling that sheet into a seamless tube, significantly enhancing its stiffness and creating unique electrical and thermal conductivity pathways. This, in essence, captures the essence of CNTs.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel on a weight-for-weight basis, is comparable to the strength of spider silk, yet their flexibility rivals that of rubber.  Moreover, their electronic properties are highly tunable, ranging from semiconducting to metallic behavior depending on their chirality (the arrangement of carbon atoms), akin to switching a light switch from on to off.  This versatility has sparked intense research interest, focusing on harnessing these exceptional properties across diverse fields including electronics, materials science, and medicine.  This paper will explore the key properties of CNTs, examining their mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics, and discussing the implications for future technological advancements.
