Black hole formation, classically understood through gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, gains further complexity from a quantum mechanical perspective.  The process fundamentally involves the interplay between gravity and quantum field theory in the extreme regime of high energy densities and strong gravitational fields near the singularity.  While a complete quantum theory of gravity remains elusive, we can anticipate deviations from classical predictions.

Quantum fluctuations in the early stages of stellar collapse might introduce uncertainties in the spacetime geometry, potentially influencing the precise moment of singularity formation and the subsequent event horizon structure.  Furthermore, Hawking radiation, a quantum phenomenon predicted from semi-classical considerations, suggests a gradual evaporation of black holes over extremely long timescales, stemming from particle-antiparticle pair creation near the event horizon.  This process challenges the classical notion of black holes as purely absorbing objects.  Finally,  quantum effects may play a significant role in resolving the information paradox, which questions the fate of information that falls into a black hole in the context of unitary quantum evolution.  A comprehensive understanding necessitates a complete theory of quantum gravity, integrating general relativity with a quantum description of spacetime.
