Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into smaller nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in nuclear physics with profound technological implications.  Initially theorized by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in 1939, following experiments by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, the process's realization stemmed from observing unexpected barium isotopes after neutron bombardment of uranium.  This groundbreaking work demonstrated the immense energy release inherent in nuclear fission, a consequence of the mass defect governed by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  

Subsequently, the controlled chain reaction, crucial for sustained energy production, was achieved by Enrico Fermi and his team in Chicago's CP-1 reactor (1942).  This achievement underpinned the development of nuclear weapons during World War II and subsequently led to the harnessing of fission for civilian power generation.  Fission reactions typically involve the bombardment of fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with neutrons, resulting in the release of further neutrons, thus sustaining a chain reaction.  The precise mechanism and efficiency of the process depend on factors like neutron energy and the reactor design, including the use of moderators and control rods to regulate the reaction rate.  The by-products of fission are various radioactive isotopes, posing significant challenges in terms of waste management and environmental safety.
