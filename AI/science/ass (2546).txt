Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique sp²-hybridized carbon structure.  These cylindrical molecules, composed of rolled-up graphene sheets, exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).  Their remarkable mechanical strength derives from the strong covalent bonds within the hexagonal carbon lattice, resulting in tensile strengths exceeding those of steel.  

Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality – the angle of the graphene sheet's roll.  This tunable conductivity makes them promising candidates for nanoelectronics.  Their high aspect ratio and large surface area contribute to excellent thermal conductivity and adsorption properties, respectively.  These properties, combined with their lightweight nature, make CNTs attractive for diverse applications, ranging from composites and sensors to energy storage and drug delivery.  However, challenges remain in scalable production and controlled functionalization for optimal integration into practical devices.
