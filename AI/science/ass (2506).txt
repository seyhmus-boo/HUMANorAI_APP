The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are intrinsically linked to their unique quantum mechanical structure.  Derived from sp²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice, rolled into cylindrical structures, CNTs exhibit strong covalent bonding within the graphene sheet and weaker van der Waals forces between individual nanotubes. This atomic arrangement dictates their electronic properties, which are highly dependent on the chiral vector defining the tube's diameter and chirality.  Quantum confinement effects, arising from the nanoscale dimensions, lead to the quantization of energy levels, resulting in either metallic or semiconducting behaviour, determined by the (n,m) indices of the chiral vector.  Metallic nanotubes possess a linear energy dispersion relation near the Fermi level, exhibiting high electrical conductivity, while semiconducting nanotubes exhibit a band gap whose magnitude inversely correlates with tube diameter.  Furthermore, the strong σ and π bonding network contributes to exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, with Young's modulus exceeding that of steel.  Finally, the unique electronic structure and high surface area also contribute to their excellent field emission and catalytic properties, rendering them suitable for a broad range of applications in electronics, materials science, and nanotechnology.
