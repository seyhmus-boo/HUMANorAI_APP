Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, releasing vast amounts of energy, forms a cornerstone of modern physics and technology.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of fission processes, tracing their historical development from the theoretical predictions of Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in 1939, which explained the experimental observations of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, to their subsequent realization in the Manhattan Project. We will explore the fundamental physics underlying fission, focusing on the role of nuclear binding energy and the probability of neutron-induced fission.  Different fissionable isotopes, notably Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, and their respective fission yields will be discussed. The presentation will also briefly touch upon the crucial role of neutron moderation and multiplication in sustaining chain reactions, essential for nuclear reactors and weapons.  Finally, we will examine the ongoing relevance of fission research, considering its contribution to energy production and the ongoing challenges in nuclear waste management and proliferation prevention.  This overview aims to provide a solid foundation for understanding this complex and impactful process.
