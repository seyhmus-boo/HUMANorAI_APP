Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges associated with characterizing carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  Their exceptional properties – high tensile strength, excellent electrical conductivity, and remarkable thermal properties – are well-documented, yet precise experimental determination remains difficult.  One major hurdle is the inherent heterogeneity of CNT samples.  Synthesized CNTs typically consist of a mixture of diameters, lengths, chiralities, and degrees of structural defects, complicating the isolation and characterization of individual nanotubes with specific properties.  Furthermore, accurately measuring mechanical properties at the nanoscale presents significant challenges.  Techniques like atomic force microscopy (AFM) are employed, but precise force measurement and preventing tip-induced damage remain crucial considerations.  Similarly, electrical characterization requires careful control of contact resistances and the development of reliable nanoscale electrode fabrication techniques. Finally, purification protocols, crucial for eliminating catalytic impurities and amorphous carbon, are complex and often introduce their own complications, impacting overall material characterization.  Addressing these experimental challenges is vital for unlocking the full potential of CNTs in advanced technological applications.
