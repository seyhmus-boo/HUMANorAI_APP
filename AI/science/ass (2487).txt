Black hole formation represents the ultimate endpoint of gravitational collapse for sufficiently massive stars.  Imagine a massive star as a colossal balloon filled with intensely hot, pressurized gas.  The outward pressure generated by nuclear fusion reactions within the core counteracts the inward pull of gravity. However, when the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, this crucial counter-pressure diminishes.  Gravity then takes over, causing the stellar core to implode upon itself in a spectacular, albeit unseen, event.  This implosion is analogous to a punctured balloon, rapidly collapsing in on its centre.  If the core’s remaining mass surpasses a critical threshold – roughly three times the mass of our Sun –  even the powerful degeneracy pressure of subatomic particles cannot withstand the gravitational force.  The core continues to shrink, its density increasing exponentially until it becomes a singularity, a point of infinite density and zero volume, surrounded by an event horizon – the point of no return from which even light cannot escape.  This singularity and its associated event horizon define the black hole, a cosmic sinkhole warping spacetime itself, a fate awaiting many stars at the end of their lifecycle.
