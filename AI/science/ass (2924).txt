Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked, exhibiting correlated behaviour regardless of spatial separation. This correlation surpasses classical physics, as the entangled particles' states remain intertwined even when physically distanced, violating Bell's inequalities.  The implications extend beyond fundamental physics, fostering interdisciplinary connections.

In quantum computing, entanglement forms the basis of powerful algorithms like Shor's algorithm for factoring large numbers, surpassing the capabilities of classical computers.  Furthermore, entanglement is crucial for quantum cryptography, enabling secure communication through quantum key distribution protocols.  In quantum metrology, entangled states enhance measurement precision, leading to advancements in sensor technology with applications in various fields, including medical imaging and gravitational wave detection.

Philosophically, entanglement challenges our understanding of locality and realism, prompting debates on the nature of reality and measurement.  Its study necessitates sophisticated mathematical frameworks, drawing upon linear algebra and group theory, while experimental verification relies heavily on advanced laser and optical technologies.  Understanding and harnessing entanglement's potential requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing physics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering.
