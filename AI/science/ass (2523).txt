Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, the fundamental process by which a cell duplicates its genome.  This semiconservative mechanism ensures the faithful transmission of genetic information during cell division.  Initiated at specific origins of replication, the process involves unwinding the double helix by helicases, followed by the synthesis of new strands by DNA polymerases.  These enzymes require a primer to initiate synthesis and work in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to the formation of leading and lagging strands with Okazaki fragments.  Finally, ligase joins these fragments, completing the replication process.  

The fidelity of DNA replication is crucial, with proofreading mechanisms minimizing errors.  However, occasional mutations can arise, forming the basis of genetic variation driving evolution.  Understanding DNA replication has profound practical applications, including advancements in forensic science (DNA fingerprinting), medical diagnostics (PCR technology for disease detection), and gene therapy, where manipulating DNA replication pathways is crucial for successful gene editing and insertion.  Further research into this intricate process continues to reveal novel insights with far-reaching implications.
