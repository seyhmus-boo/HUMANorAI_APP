Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of rolled-up graphene sheets, have captivated researchers since their discovery in 1991 by Iijima.  This presentation will explore the unique properties of CNTs that underpin their vast potential across diverse applications.  We will examine their exceptional mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel at a fraction of the weight, a consequence of the strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds forming the hexagonal lattice.  Their remarkable electrical conductivity, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality, will be discussed, alongside their high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of copper.  Furthermore, their exceptional aspect ratio and high surface area contribute to significant applications in composites, electronics, and energy storage.  The presentation will briefly outline the historical advancements in CNT synthesis, from arc discharge and laser ablation to the more widely adopted chemical vapor deposition methods.  Finally, we will touch upon current challenges and future research directions focusing on scalable production, controlled chirality synthesis, and the mitigation of agglomeration issues crucial for realizing the full potential of these remarkable materials.
