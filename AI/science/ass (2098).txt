Stellar-mass black hole formation is a consequence of the gravitational collapse of massive stars (M > 8 M⊙) at the end of their nuclear lifecycle.  Following core collapse supernovae, if the remnant stellar core exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, approximately 3 M⊙,  it lacks sufficient internal pressure to counteract its self-gravity, resulting in further unrestrained contraction.  This process continues until a singularity forms at the center, surrounded by an event horizon defining the black hole's boundary.  The precise mechanisms governing the final collapse remain an active area of research, with uncertainties related to the equation of state of dense matter and the role of rotation in shaping the resulting black hole's properties, including spin and mass.  Supermassive black holes, orders of magnitude more massive than their stellar counterparts, are thought to form via accretion of surrounding matter in dense galactic environments.  Mechanisms proposed include direct collapse of primordial gas clouds, runaway mergers of stellar-mass black holes, and the growth of seed black holes through processes of hierarchical merging and accretion. While the initial conditions and specific pathways remain subjects of ongoing investigation, these diverse formation channels contribute to the black hole population observed across the universe.
