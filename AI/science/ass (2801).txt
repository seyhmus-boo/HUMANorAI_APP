Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles.  The process initiates when a neutron interacts with the target nucleus, typically via the strong nuclear force, a residual effect of quantum chromodynamics. This interaction increases the nucleus's energy, leading to deformation and overcoming the strong nuclear force's short-range attraction, which is counteracted by the Coulomb repulsion between protons.  Quantum tunneling plays a crucial role, enabling the nucleus to surpass the potential energy barrier separating the initial state from fission fragments, even if the system lacks sufficient classical kinetic energy.  The resultant deformation leads to a scission point, where the nucleus separates into two or more fragments.

The probability of fission is dictated by the wave function describing the nuclear system, whose evolution is governed by the time-dependent Schr√∂dinger equation.  The wave function's complexity necessitates approximation methods, such as the liquid drop model, though more sophisticated approaches incorporating shell effects and collective excitations are increasingly employed.  The final fragment distribution is inherently probabilistic, reflecting the quantum nature of the process, and is influenced by factors such as the initial nucleus's shape, excitation energy, and the quantum states of the resulting fragments.  The release of neutrons further exemplifies the quantum mechanical nature, as their emission probabilities are governed by the available energy levels and nuclear transition rates.
