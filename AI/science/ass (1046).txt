The study of black hole formation represents a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, tracing its origins back to the early 20th century and Einstein's theory of General Relativity.  Initially, theoretical predictions suggested black holes could arise from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  Subsequent observations, however, presented a more nuanced picture.  While stellar-mass black holes, resulting from supernovae explosions of massive stars, are now well-established, the formation mechanisms for supermassive black holes residing at galactic centers remain a subject of active debate.  Several hypotheses, including the direct collapse of primordial gas clouds and the merging of smaller black holes, are under investigation.  Numerical simulations have proven crucial in modelling these complex processes, revealing the intricate interplay between stellar dynamics, gas accretion, and gravitational interactions.  Despite significant progress, numerous open questions persist, particularly regarding the seeds of supermassive black holes and the precise role of feedback mechanisms in regulating their growth.  Future observational efforts, especially with advanced gravitational wave detectors and next-generation telescopes, promise to shed further light on this captivating area of astrophysical research.
