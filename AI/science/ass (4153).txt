Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in nuclear physics.  The process, first observed experimentally by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, following theoretical predictions by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, marked a paradigm shift in our understanding of nuclear energy.  Their work, which demonstrated the fission of uranium-235 induced by neutron bombardment, revealed the immense energy released during this process, arising from the mass defect according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  This energy release stems from the strong nuclear force, whose binding energy per nucleon is lower for heavier nuclei than for intermediate-mass nuclei.  Subsequent research elucidated the complex mechanisms involved, including the role of neutrons in initiating a chain reaction.  The discovery of fission laid the groundwork for the development of both nuclear weapons and nuclear reactors.  While the destructive potential of nuclear fission is undeniable, its controlled application has profoundly impacted energy production, medical isotopes, and various scientific advancements, highlighting both the immense power and inherent complexities of this nuclear process.
