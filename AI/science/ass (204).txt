Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional material properties that have spurred significant research interest across diverse scientific and engineering disciplines.  This presentation will explore the key properties of CNTs, focusing on their remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus make them ideal candidates for reinforcement in composite materials, while their unique electronic structure, ranging from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality, enables applications in nanoelectronics and sensors.  We will discuss the influence of diameter, chirality, and defects on these properties, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in controlling CNT synthesis for tailored functionalities.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the thermal conductivity of CNTs, demonstrating their potential in thermal management applications.  Finally, we will briefly examine current limitations and ongoing research aimed at overcoming challenges related to processing, scalability, and cost-effectiveness to facilitate wider adoption of CNT-based technologies.
