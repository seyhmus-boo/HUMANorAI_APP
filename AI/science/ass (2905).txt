Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, represents the ultimate endpoint of stellar evolution for sufficiently massive stars.  Early theoretical work by Oppenheimer and Snyder (1939) laid the groundwork, demonstrating the gravitational collapse of a massive star beyond a critical radius, resulting in a singularity.  Subsequent research refined this model, incorporating factors such as stellar rotation, magnetic fields, and the equation of state of matter at extreme densities.  These advancements highlighted the diversity of black hole formation pathways, including direct collapse from primordial gas clouds in the early universe, and the collapse of massive stars in binary systems, often leading to binary black hole mergers detectable via gravitational waves.  Observed stellar-mass black holes, primarily identified through their dynamical influence on companion stars or through X-ray emission from accretion disks, corroborate theoretical predictions.  Supermassive black holes, residing at the centers of most galaxies, present a more complex formation scenario, possibly involving successive mergers of smaller black holes or direct collapse of massive gas clouds. Ongoing research focuses on refining models of black hole formation across various mass scales, investigating the role of feedback processes, and improving the accuracy of numerical simulations to connect theoretical predictions with observational data.
