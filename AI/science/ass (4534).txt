Plasma physics phenomena, while often treated classically, are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles.  The behaviour of individual charged particles within a plasma, electrons and ions, is dictated by their wave-particle duality.  Quantum mechanical effects become particularly significant at high densities or low temperatures where the de Broglie wavelength of particles becomes comparable to the interparticle spacing.  This leads to quantum mechanical corrections to the classical plasma equations, influencing collisional processes and transport properties.

The Pauli exclusion principle, for example, plays a crucial role in the degeneracy pressure of electrons within dense plasmas, impacting the equation of state and stability.  Furthermore, quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects, albeit often small, can contribute to plasma interactions.  Processes like radiative recombination and bremsstrahlung emission are inherently quantum mechanical, involving transitions between electronic energy levels and the emission/absorption of photons.  At sufficiently high energies,  quantum field theory becomes necessary to describe processes like pair production and annihilation.  Therefore, a complete understanding of plasma physics phenomena demands a synthesis of classical and quantum mechanical approaches, particularly in extreme environments such as those found in astrophysical plasmas or inertial confinement fusion experiments.
