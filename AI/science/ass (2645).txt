DNA replication, a fundamental process in all living organisms, ensures the faithful duplication of the genome prior to cell division.  This semiconservative mechanism involves unwinding the parental double helix by helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-strand binding proteins (SSBs) stabilize the unwound strands, preventing re-annealing.  Primase synthesizes short RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III to initiate DNA synthesis.  DNA polymerase III, the primary replicative enzyme, adds deoxyribonucleotides to the 3' end of the primer, extending the nascent strand in a 5' to 3' direction.  Leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously, while lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously, generating Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, resulting in a continuous lagging strand.  High-fidelity replication is achieved through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and various repair mechanisms that correct errors introduced during replication.  The coordination of these multiple enzymatic activities ensures the accurate and efficient duplication of the genome, maintaining genomic stability across generations.
