Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, a fundamental process ensuring genetic inheritance.  The semi-conservative model, elucidated decades ago, remains central: each parental strand serves as a template for a new complementary strand.  However, recent advancements have refined our understanding.  High-throughput sequencing technologies have allowed detailed analysis of replication origins and their spatiotemporal regulation, revealing unexpected complexity in initiation and termination site selection.  Furthermore, studies utilizing single-molecule techniques have provided unprecedented insights into the dynamics of the replication fork, including the roles of various helicases and polymerases in navigating challenging genomic landscapes like highly repetitive sequences.  Emerging research explores the interplay between replication and other cellular processes, such as transcription and repair, highlighting the intricate coordination required for genome stability.  Finally, understanding the fidelity mechanisms in replication, particularly in the context of mutagenesis and cancer, remains a significant area of ongoing investigation.  These recent developments significantly enhance our comprehension of this vital biological process.
