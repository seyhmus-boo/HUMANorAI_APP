The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their unique quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp² hybridized carbon atoms form a seamless cylindrical lattice, resulting in a delocalized π-electron system extending along the nanotube axis.  This π-electron system governs many key properties.  The electronic structure, determined by the nanotube's chirality (defined by the chiral vector (n,m)), dictates whether a CNT is metallic or semiconducting.  Metallic CNTs exhibit linear band dispersion near the Fermi level, leading to high electrical conductivity. Semiconducting CNTs, conversely, display a band gap whose magnitude depends on their (n,m) values.

Furthermore, the strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms engender exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, exhibiting tensile strengths far exceeding steel.  Quantum mechanical calculations accurately predict these mechanical properties through density functional theory (DFT) simulations, modelling the electron-electron interactions within the nanotube lattice and elucidating the stress-strain relationships.  Finally, the unique quantum confinement effects within the nanoscale diameter significantly impact the CNT's optical and thermal properties, leading to strong absorption and emission in the infrared and near-infrared regions, and high thermal conductivity along the tube axis.  These properties, intricately linked to their quantum mechanical origin, enable diverse applications in electronics, materials science, and nanotechnology.
