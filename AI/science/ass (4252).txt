Quantum entanglement is a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation arises from the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of the Hilbert space describing the composite system.  Instead of possessing individual, definite states, entangled particles exist in a shared entangled state, described by a wavefunction that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each subsystem.  Measurements performed on one entangled particle instantaneously influence the state of the other, even if they are light-years apart.  This does not violate special relativity as no information is transmitted faster than light; the correlation exists prior to measurement, and the outcome of a measurement on one particle is only probabilistically determined by the entangled state.  The violation of Bell's inequalities experimentally confirms the existence of entanglement and its inherent incompatibility with local realism, demonstrating the fundamentally non-local nature of quantum mechanics.  Entanglement forms the basis for quantum technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
