Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon arising from the superposition principle, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems wherein their fates are intrinsically linked, regardless of spatial separation.  This non-classical correlation surpasses classical correlations, exhibiting stronger-than-classical correlations between entangled particles' properties, such as spin or polarization.  Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, seemingly violating local realism.  Bell's theorem rigorously demonstrated the incompatibility of quantum mechanics with local hidden variable theories, experimentally confirmed through violations of Bell inequalities.  Entanglement finds applications in quantum computing, enabling the creation of qubits exhibiting superposition and entanglement for enhanced computational power.  Furthermore, it underpins quantum cryptography, providing unconditionally secure communication protocols through quantum key distribution.  Despite significant advancements, open questions remain concerning the precise nature of entanglement and its implications for fundamental physics, particularly concerning the interpretation of quantum measurement and the limits of locality.  Ongoing research focuses on increasing the scalability and robustness of entanglement-based technologies for broader applications.
