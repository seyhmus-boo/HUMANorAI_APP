DNA replication, the fundamental process by which genetic information is duplicated, is essential for cell proliferation and the inheritance of genetic traits.  This process, remarkably accurate despite its complexity, involves a coordinated interplay of numerous proteins and enzymes acting in a highly regulated manner.  While the basic mechanisms of DNA replication are well-established, ongoing research continues to unravel intricate details and address outstanding questions concerning its fidelity, regulation, and potential for error. This paper reviews current understanding of eukaryotic DNA replication, focusing on the key players including DNA polymerases, helicases, primases, and single-stranded binding proteins.  We examine the intricate processes of initiation, elongation, and termination, highlighting recent advancements in our comprehension of origin recognition complex function, the replication fork dynamics, and mechanisms that ensure genomic stability.  Furthermore, we discuss the implications of replication errors in disease pathogenesis and explore the therapeutic potential of targeting specific components of the replication machinery.  Finally, we identify key areas requiring further investigation, particularly concerning the complexities of replication in diverse genomic contexts and the impact of epigenetic modifications on replication fidelity.
