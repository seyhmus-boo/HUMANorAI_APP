DNA replication, the semiconservative process by which a DNA molecule produces two identical copies, is fundamental to life.  Early experiments, notably Meselson and Stahl's (1958) isotopic labeling studies, definitively demonstrated the semiconservative mechanism, rejecting conservative and dispersive models.  This landmark work built upon Watson and Crick's (1953) double helix model, which suggested a mechanism for replication based on complementary base pairing.

The process initiates at specific origins of replication, unwinding the double helix with the aid of helicases and topoisomerases. Single-strand binding proteins prevent reannealing.  DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme, synthesizes new strands in a 5' to 3' direction, continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, producing Okazaki fragments.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers to initiate synthesis.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes these primers and replaces them with DNA.  Finally, DNA ligase seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, completing replication.  Proofreading mechanisms, inherent to DNA polymerase, maintain high fidelity.  Telomeres, repetitive DNA sequences at chromosome ends, pose a unique challenge, addressed by telomerase in certain cells.  Dysregulation of this process contributes to aging and cancer.  The remarkable accuracy and efficiency of DNA replication are crucial for maintaining genomic integrity across generations.
