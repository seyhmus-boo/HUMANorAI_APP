Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission processes, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, releasing vast amounts of energy.  This process, fundamental to nuclear power generation, involves bombarding fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235, with neutrons.  Neutron absorption triggers an unstable nucleus, resulting in fission and the emission of further neutrons, creating a chain reaction.  Control over this reaction is crucial for sustainable energy production, achieved through moderator materials and control rods.

Recent developments in fission research primarily address enhanced reactor efficiency and waste management.  Accelerator-driven subcritical reactors (ADSRs) are gaining traction, offering improved safety features through external neutron sources and transmutation of long-lived nuclear waste.  Furthermore, research into innovative fuel cycles, such as those utilising thorium, aim to reduce reliance on uranium and minimise the production of actinide waste.  While challenges remain in terms of cost and public perception, advancements in materials science and reactor design are steadily paving the way for safer and more efficient fission-based energy solutions.
