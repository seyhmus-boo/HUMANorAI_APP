Good morning. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a fascinating process within astrophysics.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  When a star many times the mass of our Sun exhausts its nuclear fuel, its core collapses under its own immense gravity.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, no known force can counter the collapse, resulting in a singularity – a point of infinite density – shrouded by an event horizon.  Supermassive black holes, found at galactic centers, likely form through a combination of stellar-mass black hole mergers and direct collapse of gas clouds in the early universe.

The study of black holes, while seemingly esoteric, has practical applications.  Our understanding of gravity's extreme limits refines models of gravitational wave detection –  LIGO and Virgo rely on precisely calibrated simulations of black hole mergers.  Furthermore, accretion disks surrounding black holes emit intense radiation, offering insights into high-energy astrophysical processes.  This understanding improves our knowledge of active galactic nuclei and potentially aids in identifying and characterizing exoplanets through gravitational microlensing effects.  Research continues to reveal the intricate and impactful role of black holes in the universe.
