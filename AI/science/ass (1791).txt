Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of spatial separation.  This interconnectedness transcends classical correlations; the constituent particles exhibit correlated properties even when physically distanced beyond any conceivable influence of local interactions.  Mathematically, entangled states are represented by wavefunctions that cannot be expressed as a product of individual wavefunctions for each subsystem.  Instead, they exist in a superposition of states, described by a tensor product, where the properties of one particle are intrinsically linked to the properties of the others.  Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously collapses the wavefunction, determining the corresponding property of the other particle, irrespective of the distance separating them. This apparent non-locality has profound implications, defying classical intuitions regarding locality and causality.  The inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is further highlighted by entanglement, as the outcomes of measurements on entangled particles are probabilistic, even though the correlations between outcomes are perfectly deterministic.  Understanding and harnessing entanglement is crucial for advancements in quantum computing and quantum cryptography.
