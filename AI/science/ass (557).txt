This presentation explores the intriguing interface between quantum mechanics and the seemingly classical process of DNA replication. While DNA replication is conventionally understood through a purely classical biochemical lens, emerging evidence suggests the potential involvement of quantum effects. We will discuss the possibility of quantum phenomena, such as entanglement and tunneling, playing a role in several key steps of the replication process. This includes the accuracy of base pairing, the efficiency of enzyme catalysis (e.g., DNA polymerase), and the potential impact of environmental factors like electromagnetic fields.  We will review existing theoretical models proposing quantum contributions to DNA base pair recognition, focusing on the role of proton tunneling in tautomeric shifts and their influence on mismatches.  Further, we will address the challenges in experimentally verifying these quantum effects within the complex biological environment of the replication machinery.  Finally, the presentation will outline future research directions, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches that integrate quantum chemistry, biochemistry, and biophysics to fully elucidate the role of quantum mechanics in the fidelity and efficiency of DNA replication.
