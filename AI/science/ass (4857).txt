Black hole formation arises from the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars.  When a star's nuclear fuel is exhausted, its core, no longer supported by outward radiation pressure, succumbs to its own immense gravity.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), even the degeneracy pressure of neutrons is insufficient to counteract gravitational collapse.  This results in a singularity, a point of infinite density, surrounded by an event horizon – the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.

Different black hole progenitor masses lead to variations in the final black hole's size and properties.  Stellar-mass black holes result from the collapse of individual stars, while supermassive black holes, found at galactic centers, likely form through accretion of surrounding matter and potentially mergers of smaller black holes.

While directly observing black holes is impossible, their gravitational influence on nearby matter provides observational evidence.  This understanding has practical applications in astrophysics, allowing for the study of gravitational waves, improving models of galactic evolution, and testing theories of general relativity under extreme conditions.  Further research contributes to developing more accurate cosmological models and advancing our comprehension of the universe's ultimate fate.
