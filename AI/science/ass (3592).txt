Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, is a process underpinned by the interplay of strong and weak nuclear forces.  Imagine a carefully balanced ball perched atop a hill (the nucleus).  This ball represents the unstable nucleus, teetering on the precipice of instability.  A slight nudge – a neutron – provides the activation energy, triggering a cascade.  The ball rolls down the hill, representing the fission process itself, splitting into two smaller balls (fission fragments) and releasing further smaller balls (neutrons) with significant kinetic energy.  These smaller balls, analogous to the emitted neutrons, possess sufficient energy to initiate further “rolling” events in other precariously balanced nuclei, creating a chain reaction.

Crucially, the sum of the masses of the two smaller balls and released neutrons is slightly less than the original ball's mass. This "missing" mass is converted into a tremendous amount of energy, as dictated by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².  Think of this as the potential energy stored in the hill being released as kinetic energy of the rolling balls and heat.  Control of this chain reaction, crucial for power generation, is achieved by manipulating the "nudge" – neutron moderation and absorption – to prevent an uncontrolled avalanche.  Different fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, exhibit varying degrees of susceptibility to fission, influencing the efficiency and controllability of the process.
