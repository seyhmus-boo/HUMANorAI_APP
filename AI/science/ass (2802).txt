This presentation provides a concise overview of DNA replication, a fundamental process crucial for life's continuity.  We will explore the intricate mechanisms involved, focusing on the key enzymes and proteins responsible for accurate and efficient duplication of the genome.  This includes a discussion of the semi-conservative nature of replication, the roles of helicase, polymerase, primase, ligase, and the complexities of leading and lagging strand synthesis.  Further, we will touch upon the significance of proofreading mechanisms in maintaining genomic integrity and the consequences of errors leading to mutations.

Beyond its fundamental biological importance, understanding DNA replication has yielded numerous practical applications.  These range from advancements in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, enabling rapid DNA amplification for diagnostics and research, to the development of novel cancer therapies targeting replication machinery. We will highlight the applications of replication knowledge in forensic science,  gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9 (which exploits aspects of DNA repair pathways activated after replication), and the potential for personalized medicine based on an individual's unique genomic profile derived from replicated DNA.  The presentation will conclude by briefly addressing current research frontiers in DNA replication and their implications for future advancements in biotechnology and medicine.
