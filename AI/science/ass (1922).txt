Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  Unlike classical correlations, entanglement transcends spatial separation;  measurements performed on one entangled particle instantaneously influence the state of the others, irrespective of the distance separating them. This phenomenon arises from the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of the Hilbert space describing the composite system.  Entangled states cannot be expressed as a product of individual states for each subsystem, instead existing as a superposition of correlated states.  The Bell inequalities, experimentally violated numerous times, definitively demonstrate the non-local nature of entanglement, ruling out local hidden variable theories as complete descriptions of reality.  Mathematically, entanglement is quantified through measures like concurrence or entanglement entropy, characterizing the degree of correlation between the entangled particles.  Entanglement forms the basis for emerging quantum technologies, including quantum computing and quantum cryptography, leveraging its unique properties for information processing and secure communication.  However, the precise nature of entanglement and its implications for the foundations of quantum mechanics remain active areas of research and debate.
