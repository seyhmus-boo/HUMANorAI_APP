This presentation provides a concise overview of chemical bonding and molecular structure through the lens of quantum mechanics.  We will move beyond classical valence bond theory and explore the fundamental principles underpinning the formation of chemical bonds.  Specifically, we will examine the role of molecular orbitals, constructed from linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO), in describing bonding interactions.  Emphasis will be placed on the application of the Schr√∂dinger equation and the interpretation of its solutions, highlighting the significance of wave function symmetry and electron density distribution in predicting molecular geometry and stability.  We will explore the concepts of bonding and antibonding orbitals, their contribution to bond order, and the correlation between molecular orbital diagrams and observed spectroscopic properties.  Furthermore, the presentation will touch upon advanced techniques, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT), used for computationally modelling complex molecular structures and predicting their reactivity.  Finally, we will briefly discuss limitations of current models and highlight avenues for future research in this dynamically evolving field.
