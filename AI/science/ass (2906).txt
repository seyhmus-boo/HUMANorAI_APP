Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, into two lighter nuclei.  Imagine a carefully balanced, highly unstable stack of dominoes representing the nucleus.  A single, appropriately energetic neutron (the "push") acts as the trigger. This "push" disrupts the delicate balance, causing the dominoes (nucleons) to cascade and split the stack into two smaller, albeit still unstable, piles.

This splitting releases a significant amount of energy, analogous to the potential energy stored in the dominoes' vertical arrangement now being converted into kinetic energy as they fall.  Crucially, the fission process also releases additional neutrons, which can then trigger further fissions in a chain reaction, akin to a single domino toppling a whole line. This chain reaction, if uncontrolled, leads to an explosive release of energy as seen in nuclear weapons.  However, in a controlled environment, such as a nuclear reactor, the reaction rate is moderated to generate usable power, like carefully managing the dominoes' fall to produce a steady, controlled energy output.  The released energy originates from the mass defect, a slight decrease in mass between the original nucleus and its fission products, converted into energy via Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².
