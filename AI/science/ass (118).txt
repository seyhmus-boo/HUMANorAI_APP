Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into two lighter nuclei, releasing a substantial amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and ionizing radiation.  This process is initiated by the absorption of a neutron, causing the unstable nucleus to undergo fission.  The resulting fragments are highly radioactive, emitting beta and gamma radiation. Crucially, the fission process also releases further neutrons, facilitating a chain reaction â€“ a self-sustaining sequence of fissions if the critical mass of fissile material is reached.

The practical applications of nuclear fission are primarily focused on energy generation.  Nuclear power plants utilize controlled chain reactions to produce heat, which is then used to generate electricity via steam turbines.  This provides a high-energy density, low-carbon alternative to fossil fuels, albeit with significant challenges related to waste disposal and safety.  Furthermore, fission has found applications in medical isotopes production, utilized in diagnostics and treatments.  Military applications, including nuclear weapons, exploit the uncontrolled chain reaction for devastating explosive power, though this represents a significant ethical and security concern.  Ongoing research explores advanced reactor designs to improve safety and efficiency, and to address the challenges associated with nuclear waste management.
