DNA replication, the semiconservative process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding stemmed from the seminal work of Watson and Crick (1953), whose double helix model suggested a mechanism for replication:  each strand acting as a template for a new complementary strand.  This hypothesis was experimentally confirmed by Meselson and Stahl (1958) using density gradient centrifugation with isotopically labeled nitrogen, definitively demonstrating the semiconservative nature of replication.

The process itself is complex, involving a multitude of enzymes.  DNA helicase unwinds the double helix, creating a replication fork.  Single-strand binding proteins stabilize the separated strands, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a starting point for DNA polymerase III, the enzyme responsible for the bulk of DNA synthesis, which adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction.  Leading and lagging strands are synthesized differently, with the latter requiring Okazaki fragments and DNA ligase for joining.  Telomerase addresses the end replication problem at chromosome termini.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and various repair mechanisms.  Disruptions in these processes can lead to mutations and genomic instability, implicated in aging and disease.
