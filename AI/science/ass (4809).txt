DNA replication, a fundamental process in all living organisms, ensures the faithful duplication of the genome prior to cell division.  This semiconservative mechanism involves the unwinding of the parental double helix by helicases, creating replication forks.  Single-strand binding proteins stabilize the separated strands, preventing reannealing.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group necessary for DNA polymerase III to initiate DNA synthesis.  This polymerase adds deoxyribonucleotides to the 3' end of the growing strand, continuously synthesizing the leading strand and discontinuously synthesizing the lagging strand in Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I subsequently removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA.  DNA ligase then seals the nicks between Okazaki fragments, resulting in two identical DNA molecules.  High fidelity is maintained through the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases, which correct misincorporated nucleotides.  Telomerase addresses the problem of incomplete replication at chromosome ends, ensuring genome stability.  The intricate coordination of these enzymes and proteins ensures the accurate and efficient replication of the vast amount of genetic information contained within the genome.
