Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, making them promising candidates for a wide range of applications across diverse scientific disciplines. This presentation will explore the key properties of CNTs, highlighting their interdisciplinary relevance.  We will discuss their remarkable tensile strength and elasticity, surpassing that of steel, and their tunable electrical conductivity, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, depending on their chirality and diameter.  The exceptional thermal conductivity of CNTs, significantly higher than copper, will also be addressed.

The interdisciplinary nature of CNT research will be emphasized by examining their applications in diverse fields.  Examples include their use in materials science for reinforced composites, in electronics for advanced transistors and sensors, and in biomedical engineering for drug delivery and tissue engineering. We will explore the synergistic effects of combining CNTs with other materials, such as polymers and biomolecules, resulting in novel hybrid materials with enhanced properties.  Finally, we will briefly discuss current challenges and future research directions, focusing on scalable production methods and addressing the toxicity concerns associated with CNT handling. This presentation aims to provide an overview of the multifaceted properties of CNTs and showcase their significant potential across various interdisciplinary research areas.
