Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs).  Their discovery, albeit serendipitous, revolutionized materials science.  Initially observed in 1991 by Iijima using transmission electron microscopy, CNTs are cylindrical structures composed entirely of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, arranged in a hexagonal lattice.  This unique atomic arrangement underpins their exceptional characteristics.

Firstly, CNTs exhibit extraordinary tensile strength, exceeding that of steel by orders of magnitude.  Secondly, their thermal conductivity surpasses that of many metals, making them ideal for heat dissipation applications.  Thirdly, they demonstrate exceptional electrical conductivity, with behaviour tunable between metallic and semiconducting depending on chirality and diameter.  Finally, their high aspect ratio contributes to exceptional mechanical flexibility.  These remarkable properties make CNTs promising candidates for a wide range of applications, from advanced composites and electronics to energy storage and biomedical devices.  However, challenges remain in scaling up production and overcoming limitations associated with dispersion and functionalization.
