Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with unique cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit a remarkable array of properties rendering them attractive for diverse technological applications.  This review summarizes key characteristics driving their potential.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds, results in high tensile strength and Young's modulus, far exceeding those of steel.  Electrical properties are highly dependent on chirality, with single-walled CNTs (SWCNTs) demonstrating either metallic or semiconducting behavior, while multi-walled CNTs (MWCNTs) generally exhibit metallic conductivity.  Thermal conductivity is exceptionally high, surpassing that of copper, making them promising for thermal management applications.  Furthermore, CNTs possess a large surface area, leading to significant adsorption capabilities, which are exploited in various sensing and filtration technologies. However, challenges remain, including efficient and scalable production methods, precise control over chirality, and addressing potential toxicity concerns.  Further research focusing on these aspects is crucial for realizing the full potential of CNTs across numerous fields.
