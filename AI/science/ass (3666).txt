Quantum entanglement, a counter-intuitive phenomenon, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems wherein their fates are inextricably linked regardless of spatial separation. This non-classical correlation surpasses classical notions of locality and realism, as measurements performed on one entangled particle instantaneously influence the state of its entangled counterpart, irrespective of the distance separating them.  The entangled particles exist in a superposition of states until measurement collapses the wave function, forcing both particles into definite, yet correlated, states.  This correlation is independent of any causal influences propagating between the particles, challenging our understanding of information transfer and the fundamental nature of reality.  The strength of entanglement is quantified by measures such as concurrence and entanglement entropy, providing tools to investigate its properties and potential applications in quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation.  Further investigation into the fundamental limits and resource quantification of entanglement remains a crucial area of ongoing research.
