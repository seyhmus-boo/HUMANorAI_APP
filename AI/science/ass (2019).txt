Catalysts are indispensable in organic chemistry, significantly impacting reaction efficiency, selectivity, and the overall sustainability of chemical processes.  This review highlights the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of catalyst research.  Advances in materials science have yielded novel heterogeneous catalysts, such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs), offering superior surface area and tunable porosity compared to traditional homogeneous counterparts.  Computational chemistry plays a crucial role in catalyst design, enabling mechanistic understanding and predictive modelling of reactivity, thus accelerating the discovery of highly efficient systems.  Furthermore, the intersection of organic chemistry and biology is evident in biocatalysis, utilizing enzymes as highly selective and environmentally benign catalysts for complex transformations.  However, challenges remain, particularly concerning catalyst recyclability and scalability for industrial applications.  The development of robust, sustainable, and readily recyclable heterogeneous catalysts remains a significant area of ongoing research, emphasizing the need for continued interdisciplinary collaboration across chemistry, materials science, and engineering.  Ultimately, advancing catalyst design necessitates a holistic approach, integrating experimental and theoretical methodologies to unlock new possibilities in organic synthesis.
