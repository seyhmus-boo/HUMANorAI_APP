Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition.  Imagine two coins, intrinsically linked.  Flipping one coin instantly determines the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them.  One lands heads, the other *must* land tails; this is analogous to entangled particles.

Instead of coins, consider two electrons, each possessing a property like spin, which can be "up" or "down."  When entangled, measuring the spin of one electron instantaneously reveals the spin of the other, even if light-years apart. This isn't a transfer of information faster than light; the outcome is predetermined.  The correlation exists prior to measurement, existing as a superposition of possibilities until observed.  Think of it as two sides of the same coin â€“ inseparable, regardless of spatial separation.  Einstein famously called this "spooky action at a distance," highlighting its paradoxical nature within a classical framework.  The mystery of entanglement lies in this fundamental interconnectedness at the quantum level.
