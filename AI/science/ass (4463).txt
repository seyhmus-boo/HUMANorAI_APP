Chemical bonding and molecular structure constitute the bedrock of modern chemistry, underpinning our understanding of matter's properties and reactivity.  While fundamental principles like valence bond theory and molecular orbital theory have long provided a robust framework, recent advancements have significantly refined our predictive capabilities and expanded the scope of investigation. This paper explores the interplay between chemical bonding and molecular structure, focusing on key developments in several areas.  Firstly, significant progress has been made in computational chemistry, with density functional theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock methods enabling increasingly accurate predictions of molecular geometries and electronic properties for increasingly complex systems.  Secondly, the development of advanced spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray free electron lasers and attosecond spectroscopy, provides unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution for observing bond formation and breakage dynamics in real-time.  Finally, the synthesis and characterization of novel materials with unconventional bonding, including metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and two-dimensional (2D) materials, have challenged traditional bonding models and stimulated the development of new theoretical approaches. This review will critically examine these recent advances, highlighting their impact on our understanding of chemical bonding and its relationship to macroscopic material properties.
