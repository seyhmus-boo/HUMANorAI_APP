Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ² hybridized carbon structure and high aspect ratio.  Their mechanical strength, exceeding that of steel at a significantly lower density, is crucial in materials science and nanotechnology, enabling applications in high-strength composites and nanoscale actuators.  Electrically, CNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality, opening avenues for advanced electronics and sensor development.  This electronic tunability is exploited in interdisciplinary fields such as bioelectronics, where CNT-based biosensors and neural interfaces are being explored.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable thermal conductivity, finding use in thermal management systems.  The large surface area contributes to their effectiveness in catalysis and energy storage applications, particularly in lithium-ion batteries and supercapacitors, bridging chemistry and materials science.  However, challenges remain in scalable, cost-effective production and in overcoming challenges related to CNT dispersion and functionalization for optimal integration into various matrices, necessitating further interdisciplinary research in chemistry, physics, and engineering.
