Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  Unlike classical correlations, which can be explained by shared properties, entanglement arises from the superposition principle.  Two entangled particles, regardless of spatial separation, share a combined quantum state described by a single wavefunction.  This wavefunction cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each particle, signifying an indivisible whole.

Measurement of a property (e.g., spin) on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the outcome of a corresponding measurement on the other, even across vast distances. This seemingly instantaneous correlation doesn't violate special relativity as no information is transmitted faster than light; the correlation exists prior to measurement. The outcome of the measurement on the first particle collapses the entangled wavefunction, projecting the composite system into an eigenstate, thus determining the result for the second.  Bell's theorem experimentally disproves local realism, demonstrating the non-classical nature of entanglement, solidifying its fundamental role in quantum theory and paving the way for quantum information technologies.
