DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning heredity, ensures faithful duplication of the genome prior to cell division.  This semiconservative mechanism, elucidated by Meselson and Stahl, involves the unwinding of the parental double helix at replication forks by helicases, aided by single-stranded binding proteins to stabilize the separated strands.  DNA polymerase III, the primary replicative enzyme, synthesizes new strands in a 5' to 3' direction, utilizing the parental strands as templates.  Due to the antiparallel nature of DNA, leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously, whereas lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  Primase initiates replication by synthesizing RNA primers, which are subsequently removed and replaced with DNA by DNA polymerase I.  DNA ligase seals the gaps between Okazaki fragments, creating a continuous lagging strand.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and mismatch repair mechanisms, minimizing errors and ensuring genomic stability crucial for cellular function and organismal survival.  Telomerase addresses the challenges of replicating linear chromosome ends, preventing shortening and associated genomic instability.
