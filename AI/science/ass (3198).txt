Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  The prevailing theory posits two primary pathways: stellar-mass black holes, resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses at the end of their lifecycle, and supermassive black holes, whose formation remains a subject of ongoing debate.

Recent advancements challenge traditional models.  Observations from gravitational wave detectors like LIGO and Virgo have provided unprecedented data on merging stellar-mass black holes, revealing unexpectedly high masses and spin rates, potentially hinting at different formation mechanisms than initially assumed.  Regarding supermassive black holes,  simulations suggest that direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe might play a significant role, bypassing the typical stellar-mass black hole growth phase.  Moreover,  observations of quasars at extremely high redshifts are pushing the boundaries of our understanding of the rapid growth of these behemoths in the early universe.  These recent findings underscore the dynamic and complex nature of black hole formation, necessitating further research to refine our theoretical models.
