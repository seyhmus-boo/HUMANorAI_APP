Catalysts underpin numerous advancements in organic chemistry, enabling efficient and selective transformations that would otherwise be impractical. This presentation will survey the diverse applications of catalysts across key areas of organic synthesis. We will explore the mechanistic underpinnings of homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, highlighting recent breakthroughs in catalyst design and their impact on reaction efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability. Specific examples will encompass metal-catalyzed cross-coupling reactions, asymmetric catalysis for enantioselective synthesis, and the burgeoning field of organocatalysis.  The role of catalyst support materials and their influence on catalyst stability and reusability will also be discussed.  Furthermore, we will address the growing importance of environmentally benign catalysts and the development of sustainable catalytic processes, emphasizing the shift towards greener solvents and the reduction of waste generation.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon emerging trends in catalyst design, such as the utilization of single-site catalysts and the integration of machine learning for catalyst discovery and optimization, aiming to provide an overview of the ongoing evolution and future directions within the field of catalytic organic chemistry.
