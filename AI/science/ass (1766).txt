Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, presents significant experimental challenges.  Precise control over individual quantum systems, crucial for generating and maintaining entanglement, remains a major hurdle.  Sources of entanglement, such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion, often yield low generation rates and require complex optical setups for efficient photon collection and manipulation.  Maintaining entanglement over extended periods is hampered by decoherence arising from interactions with the environment, demanding stringent isolation techniques and low-temperature cryogenic environments.  Furthermore, accurate characterization of entangled states requires sophisticated quantum state tomography protocols, susceptible to errors due to limited measurement efficiency and imperfect detectors.  The scalability of entanglement generation and manipulation, a critical aspect for quantum computing and communication, presents a further obstacle.  Overcoming these experimental limitations necessitates advances in material science, nanofabrication, and detector technology, alongside the development of novel error correction and control strategies.  Addressing these challenges is essential for realizing the full potential of entanglement-based quantum technologies.
