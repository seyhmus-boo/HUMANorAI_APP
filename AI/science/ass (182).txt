Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure.  These cylindrical allotropes of carbon, comprising seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets, exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).  Their remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile strength exceeding that of steel, arises from the strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality (the angle and orientation of the graphene sheet during rolling).  This tunable electronic behaviour has significant implications for nanoelectronics.

Thermal conductivity in CNTs is also exceptionally high, surpassing that of many materials, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  However, practical applications are often hindered by challenges such as CNT bundling, which impacts their individual properties, and difficulties in controlled synthesis and purification.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these limitations and harnessing the exceptional properties of CNTs in diverse fields, including composites, energy storage, sensors, and biomedical applications.  The continued exploration of CNT properties promises transformative advancements in materials science and nanotechnology.
