Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes the phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of the spatial separation.  While the theoretical framework of entanglement is well-established, its practical realization and exploitation face significant experimental challenges. This paper focuses on the key hurdles encountered in generating, maintaining, and manipulating entangled states, particularly in scalable systems suitable for quantum technologies.  Challenges arise across multiple domains, including the generation of high-fidelity entangled states with low error rates.  Maintaining coherence, crucial for preserving entanglement, is particularly challenging due to environmental noise and decoherence processes.  Furthermore, the scalability of entanglement generation and manipulation poses a significant obstacle for the development of large-scale quantum computers and communication networks.  We will examine specific experimental limitations, such as the impact of imperfections in experimental apparatus, limitations in control fidelity, and the inherent fragility of entangled states.  Finally, we will discuss potential strategies for mitigating these challenges and advancing the field towards the practical application of quantum entanglement.
