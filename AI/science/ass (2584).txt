CRISPR-Cas systems, initially discovered as a bacterial adaptive immune mechanism, have revolutionized genetic engineering.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of CRISPR's historical trajectory, from its initial identification in the late 1980s as unusual DNA repeats in *Escherichia coli* to its current widespread application as a precise gene editing tool.  We will trace the key breakthroughs that led to the adaptation of CRISPR-Cas9, highlighting the pivotal contributions of  Jinek et al. (2012) in demonstrating its programmable nature. The presentation will then discuss the versatility of CRISPR technology, encompassing gene knockout, knockin, base editing, and prime editing.  We will also touch upon the ongoing development of improved CRISPR systems, addressing limitations such as off-target effects and delivery challenges.  Finally, we will briefly explore the significant ethical considerations and societal implications associated with its widespread use in diverse fields, ranging from therapeutic applications in human gene therapy to agricultural advancements and synthetic biology.  The presentation aims to provide a balanced perspective on CRISPR's transformative potential and the associated responsibilities in its ethical and responsible deployment.
