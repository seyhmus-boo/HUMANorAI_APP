Chemical bonding and molecular structure find their fundamental explanation within the framework of quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of atomic orbitals, governed by the Schrödinger equation.  When atoms approach each other, their electron clouds overlap, leading to a decrease in the overall potential energy of the system.  This stabilization is primarily driven by the electrostatic attraction between the positively charged nuclei and the negatively charged electrons residing in bonding molecular orbitals. These bonding orbitals, formed through linear combinations of atomic orbitals (LCAO), concentrate electron density between the nuclei, thereby facilitating the attractive forces.  The specific type of bond formed – covalent, ionic, or metallic – depends on the relative electronegativities of the participating atoms and the nature of the resulting molecular orbitals.  Molecular geometry, another key aspect of molecular structure, is dictated by the spatial arrangement of these molecular orbitals that minimizes electron-electron repulsion and maximizes orbital overlap. Advanced computational techniques, such as density functional theory (DFT) and ab initio methods, allow for the accurate prediction of both bonding energies and molecular geometries, providing crucial insights into the behavior of molecules and materials.
