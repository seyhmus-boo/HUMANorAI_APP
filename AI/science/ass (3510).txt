Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, remains a cornerstone of energy production and scientific inquiry. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the underlying processes governing nuclear fission, focusing on the interplay between nuclear structure, reaction dynamics, and the resulting energy release.  We examine the critical role of neutron interactions, exploring the various mechanisms of neutron-induced fission, including compound nucleus formation and direct fission processes.  Specific attention is given to the influence of nuclear deformation and shell effects on fission probabilities and fragment distributions.  Furthermore, the paper investigates the complexities of fission fragment yields, encompassing both their mass and charge distributions, and the subsequent emission of prompt and delayed neutrons.  The implications of these processes for reactor design, nuclear waste management, and the development of advanced nuclear technologies are also discussed.  A detailed analysis of relevant theoretical models and experimental data is presented, aiming to provide a current understanding of the intricacies of nuclear fission and identify areas requiring further investigation.  This work seeks to contribute to the ongoing efforts toward both safer and more efficient utilization of nuclear fission.
