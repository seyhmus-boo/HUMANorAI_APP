Nuclear fission is the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and free neutrons.  This energy release stems from the mass defect, a consequence of the strong nuclear force binding the nucleons.  The released neutrons can then trigger further fission events in a chain reaction, forming the basis of nuclear reactors and weapons.

Recent developments focus on improving the efficiency and safety of fission processes.  Advanced reactor designs, such as Generation IV reactors, aim to enhance fuel utilization, minimize waste production, and improve inherent safety features.  These include fast breeder reactors, which utilize fast neutrons to breed fissile material from fertile isotopes like uranium-238, significantly extending fuel resources.  Research into Accelerator Driven Subcritical Systems (ADS) explores using particle accelerators to drive the fission chain reaction, offering enhanced control and potentially reducing waste accumulation.  Furthermore, ongoing investigations into innovative fuel cycles and improved waste management techniques are crucial for advancing the sustainability and acceptance of nuclear fission as a viable energy source.
