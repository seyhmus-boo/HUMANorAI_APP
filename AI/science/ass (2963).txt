Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, remains a dynamic area of research.  This presentation will review the established pathways – stellar collapse of massive stars and the merger of compact objects – alongside recent advancements challenging our understanding.  We will discuss progress in numerical relativity simulations, which increasingly accurately model the complex hydrodynamics of stellar collapse, including the crucial role of rotation and magnetic fields in shaping the resulting black hole.  Furthermore, the detection of gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers by LIGO and Virgo has revolutionised our knowledge of their demographics and formation pathways. Recent data suggests a higher merger rate than initially predicted, implying potentially novel formation channels, such as dynamical capture in dense stellar environments or direct collapse scenarios in extremely high-density regions.  Finally, we will touch upon ongoing efforts to probe the elusive initial conditions of black hole formation, leveraging observations from multi-messenger astronomy, including electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave events, to unveil the rich physics underpinning these enigmatic objects.
