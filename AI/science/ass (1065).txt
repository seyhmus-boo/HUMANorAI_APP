Nuclear fission is the process whereby a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy and further neutrons.  This neutron release is crucial, as it sustains a chain reaction, the basis of nuclear power generation and weaponry.  The process is governed by the strong and weak nuclear forces, with the balance between these forces determining the stability of the nucleus.  Fission yields vary depending on the fissile material and incident neutron energy, generating a spectrum of fission products, many of which are radioactive.

Recent developments focus on improving reactor efficiency and safety, along with addressing the challenge of nuclear waste management.  Advances in Generation IV reactor designs, such as molten salt reactors and fast breeder reactors, aim to enhance fuel utilization and reduce waste production.  Research into Accelerator Driven Subcritical Systems (ADS) explores using particle accelerators to control the fission chain reaction, potentially enhancing safety and enabling the transmutation of long-lived radioactive waste.  Furthermore, ongoing research into advanced fuel cycles and separation techniques strives to optimize the use of uranium resources and minimize the long-term radiological impact.
