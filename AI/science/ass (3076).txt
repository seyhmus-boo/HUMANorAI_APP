Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties rendering them promising materials for diverse technological applications. This presentation will explore the key characteristics driving their potential.  Their remarkable tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, alongside exceptional flexibility and high aspect ratio, makes them ideal for reinforcing composites, enhancing mechanical performance in areas like aerospace and automotive engineering.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate unique electrical properties, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality,  opening avenues for advanced electronics, including high-frequency transistors and transparent conductive films for flexible displays.  Their high thermal conductivity contributes to improved heat dissipation in microelectronics and thermal management systems.  The presentation will also briefly review recent advances in CNT synthesis and functionalization techniques, crucial for controlling their properties and enabling integration into practical devices.  Finally, we will discuss ongoing challenges and future research directions focused on scalability and cost-effective production for widespread commercial implementation of CNT-based technologies.
