This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on the underlying physics and their technological applications.  We begin by outlining the fundamental principles governing nuclear fission, including the role of neutron-induced reactions, criticality, and the release of energy through mass defect.  Different fissionable isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, and their respective fission yields and neutron emission characteristics will be discussed.  The presentation will then explore the various types of nuclear reactors, highlighting the differences in their designs and operational principles, including pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs).  A brief analysis of the challenges associated with nuclear fission, including radioactive waste management and nuclear proliferation concerns, will be presented.  Finally, the presentation will briefly address current research and advancements in nuclear fission technology, such as advanced reactor designs aimed at enhancing safety and efficiency, and the potential for thorium-based reactors.  The aim is to provide a balanced and informative overview of this crucial energy source, considering both its benefits and drawbacks.
