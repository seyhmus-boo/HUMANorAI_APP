DNA replication is the fundamental process by which a cell duplicates its genome prior to cell division, ensuring genetic continuity.  This semi-conservative process involves unwinding the double helix by helicases, creating a replication fork.  Single-stranded binding proteins stabilize the separated strands, preventing reannealing.  Primase then synthesizes short RNA primers, providing a starting point for DNA polymerase, which adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, continuously on the leading strand and discontinuously on the lagging strand, forming Okazaki fragments.  DNA ligase joins these fragments.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerase.

The understanding of DNA replication has yielded numerous practical applications.  Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technology, based on the principles of in vitro DNA synthesis, is crucial in diagnostics, forensics, and genetic engineering.  Furthermore, knowledge of replication mechanisms informs the development of anti-cancer drugs targeting DNA polymerases in rapidly dividing tumor cells.  Investigating replication errors also contributes to understanding genetic diseases and aging processes, potentially leading to therapeutic interventions.  Ultimately, comprehending DNA replication is foundational to advancements in numerous biological fields.
