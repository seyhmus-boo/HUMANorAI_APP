Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense potential for diverse technological applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains elusive, yielding heterogeneous mixtures of chiralities, diameters, and lengths, which significantly impacts their macroscopic properties.  Characterizing the precise structure and defects within individual CNTs, crucial for understanding property variations, necessitates advanced techniques like high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and Raman spectroscopy, often limited by sample preparation and analysis complexities.  Furthermore, the inherent tendency of CNTs to agglomerate due to strong van der Waals forces hinders their effective dispersion in matrices for composite material applications, demanding sophisticated functionalization strategies that may compromise their intrinsic properties.  Quantifying the influence of these factors on device performance is also challenging, requiring intricate device fabrication and characterization methodologies capable of resolving individual CNT contributions within complex assemblies.  Overcoming these experimental limitations is crucial for unlocking the full potential of CNTs in next-generation technologies.
