Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, operates through two interconnected mechanisms: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  Imagine a factory: the light-dependent reactions are akin to the power generation plant.  Chlorophyll, acting like solar panels, captures light energy, splitting water molecules (photolysis) – this is like harnessing sunlight to generate electricity.  This process releases electrons, which are passed along an electron transport chain, a series of chemical reactions analogous to a circuit, generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's energy currency, and NADPH, a reducing agent – think of these as the factory's energy storage batteries.

The light-independent reactions, on the other hand, resemble the factory's assembly line.  Using the ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions as energy and reducing power, carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is incorporated into organic molecules like glucose – the raw materials being processed into a finished product. This process, catalysed by the enzyme RuBisCO, is a cyclical series of reactions,  continuously building sugars from atmospheric carbon dioxide – a never-ending production line assembling glucose, the plant's primary source of energy and building blocks.  The entire process, therefore, represents a highly efficient energy conversion system driven by sunlight.
