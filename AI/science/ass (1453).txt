The concept of chemical bonding, explaining the forces holding atoms together in molecules, evolved significantly throughout history.  Early theories, like Dalton's atomic theory (early 19th century), lacked a mechanism to explain this cohesion.  The advent of quantum mechanics revolutionized the field, providing the foundation for modern understanding.  Lewis's valence bond theory (early 20th century), focusing on shared electron pairs, provided a simple, intuitive model for covalent bonds.  This was further refined by Linus Pauling's work incorporating resonance and hybridisation, successfully explaining molecular geometries.

Simultaneously, molecular orbital theory emerged, offering a more mathematically rigorous description of bonding by considering the delocalized nature of electrons within a molecule.  This theory explains phenomena like aromaticity and the stability of conjugated systems.  Both valence bond and molecular orbital theory provide valuable, albeit contrasting, perspectives on molecular structure.  Ultimately, the choice between these models depends on the specific system and desired level of detail, with both contributing significantly to our comprehensive understanding of chemical bonding and its impact on molecular properties.
