Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, remains a topic of significant ongoing research. This presentation will explore the diverse mechanisms leading to these enigmatic objects, focusing on stellar-mass black holes arising from core-collapse supernovae and supermassive black holes potentially originating from direct collapse or the mergers of smaller black holes. We will examine the crucial role of stellar evolution, including progenitor star mass and metallicity, in determining the final fate of massive stars and the subsequent formation of black holes.  The dynamics of accretion disks, crucial for both growth and observable signatures like jets and quasars, will be discussed.

Beyond theoretical understanding, the study of black hole formation has practical applications. Gravitational wave astronomy, enabled by detectors like LIGO and Virgo, allows for the direct observation of binary black hole mergers, providing invaluable data to constrain theoretical models and refine our understanding of stellar evolution and galactic dynamics. Furthermore, the computational techniques developed to simulate black hole formation have broader applicability in fields like fluid dynamics and plasma physics.  Finally, understanding black hole formation contributes to the broader context of galaxy evolution, as supermassive black holes play a critical role in shaping their host galaxies through feedback mechanisms. This presentation aims to offer a concise overview of current research, highlighting the interplay between theoretical modeling, observational data, and practical applications in this fascinating field.
