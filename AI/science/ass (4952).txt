Photosynthesis, the fundamental process underpinning most life on Earth, has captivated scientists for centuries.  Early understanding, dating back to the 17th century with van Helmont's willow tree experiment, focused on the role of water and soil.  However, it was not until the 19th century, with the work of Ingenhousz and Priestley, that the crucial roles of light and gas exchange became clear.  This presentation will offer a concise overview of the modern understanding of photosynthetic mechanisms, emphasizing the two major pathways: C3 and C4.  We will explore the light-dependent reactions, including the critical roles of photosystems I and II, the electron transport chain, and ATP synthesis.  Furthermore, the presentation will detail the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle), highlighting the carbon fixation process and subsequent carbohydrate production.  The evolutionary adaptations represented by C4 photosynthesis, offering enhanced efficiency in arid conditions, will also be discussed. By tracing the historical development of our knowledge alongside a contemporary description of the intricate biochemical processes involved, this presentation aims to provide a comprehensive, yet accessible, introduction to the fascinating world of photosynthesis.
