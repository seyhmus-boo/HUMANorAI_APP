Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges inherent in elucidating chemical bonding and molecular structure.  While theoretical models provide valuable insights, experimental verification remains crucial.  Determining bond lengths and angles presents significant hurdles.  Techniques like X-ray crystallography, while powerful, are limited to crystalline samples and may be affected by radiation damage.  NMR spectroscopy, though applicable to solutions, can struggle with large, complex molecules, resulting in complex spectra difficult to fully interpret.  Furthermore, dynamic processes, such as isomerization or conformational changes, complicate the acquisition of static structural information.  Electron diffraction provides gas-phase data, but obtaining sufficient vapour pressure can be problematic.  Finally,  the experimental determination of subtle bonding interactions, such as weak hydrogen bonds or van der Waals forces, frequently requires highly sensitive and sophisticated instrumentation, often operating at low temperatures. Overcoming these experimental limitations is central to advancing our understanding of molecular structure and reactivity.
