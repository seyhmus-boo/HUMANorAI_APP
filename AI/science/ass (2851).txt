Nuclear fission is the process by which a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy and ionizing radiation.  This process is initiated by neutron bombardment, causing the nucleus to become unstable and undergo fission.  The released neutrons can then induce further fission reactions, leading to a chain reaction, the basis of nuclear reactors and weapons.

Recent developments in fission research focus on enhancing reactor efficiency and safety, and mitigating nuclear waste.  Advanced reactor designs, such as Generation IV reactors, aim to improve fuel utilization, enhance safety features through inherent passive safety mechanisms, and reduce the volume and radiotoxicity of spent fuel.  Research into accelerator-driven subcritical systems (ADS) explores using particle accelerators to control the fission chain reaction, potentially enabling the transmutation of long-lived radioactive waste into less hazardous isotopes.  Furthermore, studies on innovative fuel cycles, like thorium-based reactors, are underway, offering the potential for improved fuel efficiency and reduced proliferation risks. These advancements represent a concerted effort to harness the power of nuclear fission while mitigating its inherent risks.
