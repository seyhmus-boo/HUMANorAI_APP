Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, is a process analogous to a carefully balanced stack of dominoes.  A single, strategically placed domino (a neutron) triggers a chain reaction, toppling its neighbours (fissioning further nuclei) and releasing considerable energy in the process. This energy release, mirroring the kinetic energy of falling dominoes, originates from the strong nuclear force binding the nucleons.  Unlike the dominoes, however, the released energy manifests as both kinetic energy of fission fragments and gamma radiation, mimicking the dominoes' impact force and a sudden burst of light, respectively.  The critical mass, the minimum amount of fissile material required for a sustained chain reaction, is akin to the minimum number of dominoes needed to ensure the reaction propagates across the entire stack.  Control rods in nuclear reactors act as strategically placed obstacles, analogous to barriers between the dominoes, limiting the propagation speed and overall energy release.  Variations in the fission process, leading to different fragment distributions, are comparable to the variability in the dominoes' toppling angles and their subsequent collisions.  Understanding these analogies provides a simplified but effective framework for grasping the fundamental concepts underlying nuclear fission.
