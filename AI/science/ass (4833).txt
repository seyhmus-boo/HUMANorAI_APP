Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms.  Their unique structure underpins their exceptional characteristics.  Firstly, CNTs exhibit extraordinary mechanical strength, boasting tensile strengths far exceeding steel, alongside high elasticity. This, coupled with their low density, makes them ideal for lightweight, high-strength composites.  Secondly, their electrical properties are highly dependent on chirality; some exhibit metallic conductivity, while others are semiconducting, offering versatile applications in electronics.  Recent developments focus on precisely controlling chirality during synthesis, enabling the fabrication of highly-ordered arrays for improved device performance.  Thirdly, CNTs possess exceptional thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation in advanced electronics and thermal management systems.  Finally, ongoing research explores their potential in biomedical applications, with studies demonstrating their use as drug delivery vehicles and biosensors.  These advancements highlight the ongoing potential of CNTs across diverse scientific and technological fields.
