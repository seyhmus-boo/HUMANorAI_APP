Quantum entanglement, a fundamental phenomenon in quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems stronger than any classical relationship.  Imagine two coins flipped simultaneously, but in a way where knowing the outcome of one instantly reveals the state of the other, regardless of the spatial separation. This seemingly paradoxical connection arises because entangled particles share a unified quantum state, not simply correlated individual states.  Unlike classical correlations which can be explained by shared history, entangled particles exhibit non-local correlations, violating Bell's inequalities.  This interconnectedness is not a transfer of information faster than light, but rather a reflection of the underlying quantum reality where individual particles lack well-defined properties until measured.  Experimentally verified numerous times, entanglement forms the bedrock of quantum technologies like quantum computing and quantum cryptography. The study of entanglement continues to deepen our understanding of the fundamental nature of reality and challenges our intuitive notions of locality and realism.  Further investigation promises significant advancements in both theoretical physics and practical applications.
