Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, releases immense energy, analogous to a carefully balanced stack of dominoes.  A single initiating neutron, like the nudge to the first domino, triggers a chain reaction.  This neutron impacts the nucleus, causing it to become unstable and subsequently fission into two lighter nuclei,  much like a domino striking others in a cascading sequence.  This fission releases further neutrons, which in turn induce fission in other nuclei, perpetuating the chain reactionâ€”a self-sustaining process if the system's critical mass is exceeded. The released energy, equivalent to the potential energy stored in the entire domino stack, manifests as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons, as well as gamma radiation.  Control of this chain reaction, akin to strategically positioning the dominoes, is crucial in nuclear reactors, where moderators and control rods are employed to regulate the neutron flux and prevent uncontrolled energy release.  Conversely, uncontrolled chain reactions, like a chaotic domino effect, are characteristic of nuclear weapons. The precise mechanics of the fission process depend on the specific isotope and its nuclear structure; however, the fundamental principle of energy release through nuclear rearrangement remains constant.
