Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, with ongoing debates surrounding the specific mechanisms and progenitor stars involved. This presentation will review the current understanding of black hole formation pathways, focusing on two primary scenarios: the direct collapse of massive stars and the merger of compact stellar remnants.  We will explore the critical role of stellar metallicity, rotation, and magnetic fields in determining the final fate of massive stars, discussing how these factors influence the collapse process and the properties of the resulting black hole.  The impact of binary stellar evolution on black hole formation will be emphasized, highlighting the frequency of binary mergers and their contributions to the observed black hole binary population detected by gravitational wave observatories. Furthermore, we will discuss the challenges in observationally confirming theoretical predictions, focusing on the limitations of current techniques in identifying progenitor systems and measuring black hole masses and spins.  Finally, the presentation will touch upon open questions and future research directions, including improved numerical simulations and multi-messenger observations that aim to refine our understanding of this complex astrophysical phenomenon.
