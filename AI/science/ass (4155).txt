The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) stem directly from their quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon atoms form a seamless honeycomb lattice, rolled into cylindrical structures. This unique geometry dictates the electronic properties, which are profoundly influenced by the nanotube's chirality (the angle of the lattice's roll) and diameter.  Chirality determines whether a CNT is metallic or semiconducting.  Metallic CNTs exhibit a linear energy dispersion relation near the Fermi level, a consequence of the band structure exhibiting a gapless energy spectrum at specific chiral angles.  Conversely, semiconducting CNTs possess a band gap, the size of which is inversely proportional to diameter, a quantum confinement effect.  This size-dependent band gap arises from the quantization of electron wavefunctions within the nanotube's confined geometry.  Furthermore, the strong covalent σ-bonds within the hexagonal lattice contribute to their exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, while the π-electrons contribute to their electrical conductivity and optical properties, further highlighted by the unique density of states stemming from their one-dimensional nature.  The interplay of these quantum mechanical phenomena governs CNT's diverse functionalities.
