Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the experimental challenges inherent in studying quantum entanglement. While the theoretical framework is well-established, realizing and manipulating entangled states presents significant hurdles.  Firstly, maintaining coherence is paramount. Entangled states are exceptionally fragile, rapidly decohering through interactions with the environment.  Minimising environmental noise necessitates cryogenic temperatures, ultra-high vacuum, and sophisticated shielding from electromagnetic interference, all demanding significant technological resources.

Furthermore, the efficient generation of entangled pairs poses a considerable challenge. While various methods exist, such as spontaneous parametric down-conversion or trapped ion systems, achieving high entanglement fidelity and generation rates remains an active area of research.  Finally, accurate and robust state tomography, the process of reconstructing the quantum state, introduces further complications.  Precise measurements are crucial, and current techniques are limited by detector efficiencies and background noise, hindering our ability to fully characterize entangled states. Overcoming these experimental limitations is crucial for advancing quantum technologies reliant on entanglement.
