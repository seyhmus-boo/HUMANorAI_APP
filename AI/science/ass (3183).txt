Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, remains incompletely understood at the quantum level.  Classical general relativity describes the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars, leading to singularities hidden behind event horizons. However, this picture breaks down at the Planck scale, where quantum gravitational effects become dominant.  This abstract explores current theoretical approaches attempting to bridge this gap, focusing on the interplay between quantum field theory and gravity near the event horizon.  Models incorporating quantum effects, such as Hawking radiation, suggest a gradual evaporation of black holes, challenging the notion of a truly singular endpoint.  Furthermore, the information paradox, questioning the fate of information swallowed by a black hole, necessitates a quantum mechanical resolution.  String theory and loop quantum gravity offer potential frameworks, predicting modifications to spacetime geometry near the singularity, potentially preventing its formation or resolving it into a less singular state.  While definitive answers remain elusive, ongoing research promises a deeper understanding of black hole formation, unifying general relativity's macroscopic description with a fundamental quantum mechanical framework.  This unification is crucial for a complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity.
