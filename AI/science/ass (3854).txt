Photosynthesis, the cornerstone of terrestrial carbon cycling, continues to reveal intricate mechanistic details despite decades of research.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of current understanding of photosynthetic mechanisms, focusing on recent advancements in several key areas.  We will examine progress in elucidating the precise structural dynamics of photosystem II, particularly the oxygen-evolving complex, through advanced cryo-electron microscopy studies, and their implications for understanding water oxidation.  Furthermore, we will discuss the emerging role of  photoprotection mechanisms, such as non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and xanthophyll cycle activity, in optimizing photosynthetic efficiency under fluctuating light conditions.  Recent breakthroughs in understanding the regulation of photosynthetic electron transport and carbon fixation will also be highlighted, including advancements in the study of Rubisco activase and its impact on carboxylation efficiency.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the potential for engineering photosynthetic pathways to enhance crop yields and contribute to climate change mitigation, acknowledging the challenges and opportunities in this rapidly developing field.
