DNA replication, the fundamental process by which genetic information is duplicated, is crucial for cellular proliferation and inheritance.  This presentation provides a concise overview of this intricate process, tracing its historical understanding from early conceptualizations to current molecular mechanisms.  Early experiments, such as those by Hershey and Chase, solidified DNA's role as the hereditary material, paving the way for the elucidation of its structure by Watson and Crick.  This structural discovery provided the foundation for understanding the semiconservative nature of replication, experimentally confirmed by Meselson and Stahl.  The presentation will then delve into the key enzymatic players involved, including DNA polymerases, helicases, primases, and ligases, highlighting their respective roles in unwinding the double helix, synthesizing leading and lagging strands, and resolving replication-associated challenges like Okazaki fragment processing.  Furthermore, the presentation will touch upon the complexities of eukaryotic replication, including the involvement of multiple origins of replication and the regulation of the process. Finally, it will briefly address the implications of replication errors and their contribution to genomic instability and disease.
