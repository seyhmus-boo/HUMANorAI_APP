CRISPR-Cas systems, while revolutionary in genetic engineering, operate within a classical framework, neglecting the inherent quantum mechanical nature of biological systems.  This review highlights the limitations of a purely classical understanding of CRISPR's efficacy.  While the target recognition mechanism, involving base pairing, can be described classically, the underlying processes – such as enzyme conformational changes and DNA unwinding – are governed by quantum tunnelling and vibrational energy states.  Ignoring these quantum effects leads to an incomplete picture of CRISPR's efficiency and specificity.  Furthermore, the impact of environmental noise and fluctuations, inherently quantum phenomena, on the fidelity of CRISPR-mediated gene editing remains largely unexplored.  Future research should leverage quantum approaches to model enzyme dynamics and DNA-protein interactions, leading to improved understanding of off-target effects and potentially facilitating the design of more precise and efficient CRISPR systems.  Integrating quantum mechanics into CRISPR modelling will provide a more comprehensive framework for predicting and optimizing gene editing outcomes, potentially unlocking novel therapeutic applications.  The inherent limitations of classical mechanics in describing this complex biological system necessitate a quantum mechanical perspective to advance the field.
