Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  Unlike classical correlations, which can be explained by shared properties or pre-existing states, entangled systems exhibit correlations that defy any local realistic description.  This means that the measurement outcome on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the outcome on the other, regardless of the spatial separation between them. This phenomenon arises from the superposition principle, where a composite system exists in a superposition of entangled states, represented by a non-separable wavefunction.  Crucially, the wavefunction collapses upon measurement of one subsystem, instantaneously determining the state of the other, even across vast distances. This instantaneous correlation, while seemingly paradoxical from a classical perspective, does not violate causality as no information can be transmitted faster than light.  The specific nature of the entanglement is determined by the entangled state, which can be maximally entangled (like the Bell states) or partially entangled. The violation of Bell's inequalities in experimental tests definitively confirms the existence of entanglement and its non-classical nature, highlighting the profound differences between quantum and classical correlations.
