Nuclear fission is the process of splitting a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium-235 or plutonium-239, into smaller nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy and gamma radiation.  This energy release stems from the mass defect, where the combined mass of the daughter nuclei is slightly less than the parent nucleus, the difference being converted to energy according to Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.  The process is initiated by neutron bombardment, which triggers a chain reaction if sufficient fissile material is present.  Control of this chain reaction is crucial in nuclear reactors, achieved through neutron moderators and control rods.

Recent developments focus on enhancing reactor efficiency and safety.  Advancements in materials science are leading to the development of accident-tolerant fuels, capable of withstanding higher temperatures and preventing core melt-down scenarios.  Furthermore, research into Generation IV reactors explores innovative designs, such as molten salt reactors, which offer improved safety features and enhanced fuel utilization, potentially reducing nuclear waste.  Studies on Accelerator Driven Subcritical Systems (ADSS) aim to improve waste transmutation by utilizing a particle accelerator to sustain a subcritical fission chain reaction, thus minimizing long-lived radioactive waste. These ongoing efforts strive to improve the sustainability and safety profile of nuclear fission as a power source.
