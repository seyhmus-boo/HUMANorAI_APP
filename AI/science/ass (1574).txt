Black hole formation represents a critical endpoint in stellar evolution, dictated by the interplay of gravity and stellar structure.  Massive stars, exceeding approximately 20 solar masses, exhaust their nuclear fuel, culminating in core collapse.  The ensuing gravitational collapse overcomes degeneracy pressure, driving the core's density towards infinity, forming a singularity.  This process is accompanied by the ejection of outer layers in a spectacular supernova explosion.  The remnant's mass determines its fate: objects exceeding the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses) inevitably collapse into a black hole, while less massive remnants become neutron stars.  The collapse is significantly influenced by factors such as the star's initial mass, metallicity, and rotational velocity, affecting the pre-collapse core structure and ultimately the black hole's mass and spin. Further collapse is prevented by the singularity's event horizon, a boundary beyond which no information, including light, can escape. The resulting black hole profoundly interacts with its surrounding environment, influencing galactic evolution and triggering energetic phenomena such as active galactic nuclei.
