CRISPR-Cas systems, derived from bacterial adaptive immunity, have revolutionized genetic engineering. This lecture will explore the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9, the most widely utilized system.  The guide RNA, designed to target a specific DNA sequence, directs the Cas9 nuclease to induce a double-stranded break at the target locus.  This break triggers cellular DNA repair mechanisms, either non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), resulting in insertions or deletions (indels) causing gene disruption, or homology-directed repair (HDR), enabling precise gene editing via a supplied DNA template.  The lecture will further discuss advancements beyond Cas9, including base editors for precise nucleotide substitutions without double-stranded breaks and prime editors for more extensive editing capabilities.  Applications discussed will range from correcting genetic defects in model organisms and human cells to developing disease-resistant crops and novel biotechnologies.  Limitations, such as off-target effects and ethical considerations surrounding germline editing, will also be addressed, highlighting the ongoing importance of responsible development and application of this powerful technology.
