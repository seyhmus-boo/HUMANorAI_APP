Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more quantum particles become linked, sharing the same fate regardless of spatial separation.  This correlation, exceeding classical limits, manifests in the instantaneous correlation of their quantum states.  Einstein famously termed this "spooky action at a distance."

Early experiments predominantly verified entanglement through Bell inequality violations, confirming the non-classical nature of this phenomenon. However, recent developments have focused on leveraging entanglement for practical applications.  Significant progress has been made in quantum computing, where entangled qubits form the basis for powerful algorithms surpassing classical computation.  Furthermore, advancements in quantum communication, notably quantum key distribution, utilise entangled photons to generate secure cryptographic keys.  Research into entanglement distribution across increasing distances is also progressing rapidly, with notable achievements in satellite-based experiments demonstrating the feasibility of global quantum networks.  These breakthroughs underscore the transition of entanglement from a purely theoretical curiosity to a crucial resource for emerging quantum technologies.
