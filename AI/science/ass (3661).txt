Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on nuclear fission through a quantum mechanical lens.  Unlike classical mechanics which cannot account for the stability of nuclei, quantum mechanics provides the framework for understanding this process.  The strong nuclear force, mediated by gluons, binds protons and neutrons within the nucleus, but this force is short-ranged.  As the nucleus grows larger, the Coulombic repulsion between protons becomes increasingly significant, overcoming the strong force at a critical mass.

This instability manifests as a quantum tunneling phenomenon.  The wavefunction of the nucleus, described by the Schr√∂dinger equation incorporating the strong and electromagnetic forces, has a non-zero probability of existing in states outside the potential well, representing fission.  The probability of tunneling increases with increasing nuclear size and excitation energy.  Once the tunneling occurs, the nucleus undergoes rapid deformation, ultimately leading to the separation into smaller fragments, releasing enormous amounts of energy, primarily from the decrease in the strong force's binding energy and the conversion of mass into energy as described by Einstein's famous equation. This energy release is a direct consequence of the quantum mechanical nature of the strong and electromagnetic forces at play.
