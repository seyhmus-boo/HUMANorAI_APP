This presentation explores the fascinating interplay between quantum mechanics and plasma physics phenomena, moving beyond the classical magnetohydrodynamic descriptions.  We will focus on regimes where quantum effects, typically neglected in macroscopic plasma models, become significant. Specifically, we will examine the role of quantum statistics in determining plasma properties, highlighting deviations from classical Boltzmann distributions under conditions of high density or low temperature.  Particular attention will be given to the impact of quantum effects on collective plasma oscillations, focusing on the emergence of quantum plasmon modes and their influence on energy transport and wave propagation.  We will further discuss the relevance of quantum tunneling and its consequences for particle transport across potential barriers, particularly in the context of fusion plasmas.  Finally, we will briefly address the burgeoning field of quantum plasma simulations, examining numerical techniques and their efficacy in modelling these complex, intrinsically quantum-mechanical systems.  The presentation aims to provide an overview of the current understanding of quantum plasma phenomena and to stimulate discussion regarding future research directions in this rapidly advancing field.
