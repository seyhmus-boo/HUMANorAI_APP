Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains a rich area of investigation despite considerable theoretical progress.  This presentation will address the significant experimental challenges associated with directly observing and verifying the processes leading to black hole creation.  While gravitational wave astronomy has provided unprecedented insights into the mergers of already-formed black holes, the initial collapse phase from progenitor stars remains largely unobserved.  Direct electromagnetic observation is hampered by the extreme gravitational fields and obscuring effects of accretion disks.  We will discuss the limitations of current observational techniques, including the challenges of resolving stellar-mass black hole formation within the dense stellar environments of galactic centers and the difficulties in distinguishing the signatures of black hole formation from other high-energy astrophysical phenomena such as supernovae.  Furthermore, we will explore the potential of future observational strategies, such as advanced interferometry with increased sensitivity and higher spatial resolution, next-generation telescopes capable of observing in the multi-messenger domain, and the development of sophisticated numerical modelling to interpret complex observational data.  Addressing these experimental challenges is crucial for advancing our understanding of black hole formation and the evolution of the universe.
