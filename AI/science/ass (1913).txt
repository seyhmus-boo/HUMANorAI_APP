Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in stellar evolution, driven by the relentless pull of gravity.  This lecture will outline the primary mechanisms governing this process.  For stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses, core collapse supernovae provide the dominant pathway.  Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel, the core, primarily composed of iron, undergoes catastrophic gravitational collapse.  This implosion triggers a runaway process, resulting in the formation of a singularity and an accompanying event horizon, defining the black hole boundary.  Less massive stars, within the range of approximately 3-20 solar masses, may also form black holes through similar core-collapse mechanisms, although with varying degrees of supernova energy release.  Finally, supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, represent a distinct formation puzzle, with current theories invoking processes such as the direct collapse of massive gas clouds or hierarchical mergers of smaller black holes as potential explanations.  Further research is needed to elucidate the precise conditions and relative contributions of each formation channel.
