Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems wherein their fates are intertwined irrespective of spatial separation.  This non-classical correlation surpasses any classical description, exhibiting stronger-than-classical correlations between measurable properties.  Entangled particles, prepared in a superposition state, exhibit a shared fate: a measurement performed on one instantaneously influences the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them.  This instantaneous correlation does not, however, violate causality, as no information transfer faster than light occurs.  Bell's theorem mathematically demonstrates the incompatibility of local realism with the predictions of quantum mechanics concerning entanglement, experimentally confirmed numerous times.  The underlying mechanism remains an area of ongoing investigation, with various interpretations proposed, including those based on non-locality and hidden variables, though the latter have been largely refuted.  Further exploration of entanglement is crucial for advancements in quantum computing, cryptography, and fundamental tests of quantum theory.
