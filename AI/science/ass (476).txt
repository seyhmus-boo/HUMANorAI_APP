Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, operates through two interconnected mechanisms: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The light-dependent reactions can be likened to a water pump powered by sunlight.  Chlorophyll, embedded within thylakoid membranes, acts as the pump's solar panel, absorbing photons and energizing electrons.  This energy drives the "pumping" of protons across the thylakoid membrane, creating a proton gradient, analogous to water pressure behind a dam.  This gradient then powers ATP synthase, a molecular turbine that generates ATP, the cell's energy currency.  Simultaneously, water molecules are split (photolysis), releasing electrons to replenish those lost by chlorophyll and oxygen as a byproduct.

The light-independent reactions, in contrast, resemble a factory assembly line.  The ATP and NADPH generated in the light-dependent reactions (the "energy" and "building blocks") fuel the fixation of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere.  The enzyme RuBisCo acts as the assembly line's chief operator, incorporating CO2 into existing organic molecules, gradually constructing sugars (glucose) through a series of enzymatic reactions.  These sugars represent the stored chemical energy, the factory's finished product, which the plant utilizes for growth and metabolic processes.
