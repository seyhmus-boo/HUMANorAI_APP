Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, have captivated scientific interest since their discovery by Iijima in 1991.  This presentation will explore the remarkable properties of CNTs that stem from their unique one-dimensional structure and strong covalent bonding.  We will examine their exceptional mechanical properties, including high tensile strength and Young's modulus, exceeding those of steel, making them ideal for advanced composite materials.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the exceptional electrical conductivity of CNTs, which is dependent on chirality and diameter, exhibiting metallic or semiconducting behavior.  Their high aspect ratio and unique surface area also lead to remarkable thermal conductivity and adsorption capabilities.  The diverse properties of CNTs underpin their potential applications in a wide array of fields, ranging from nanoelectronics and energy storage (e.g., batteries, supercapacitors) to biomedical devices and reinforcement in high-performance materials.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon ongoing challenges in scalable, cost-effective production and the development of novel applications for these versatile nanomaterials.
