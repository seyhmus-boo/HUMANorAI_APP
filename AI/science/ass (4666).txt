DNA replication, a fundamental process for cellular proliferation and heredity, ensures faithful duplication of the genome. This semi-conservative mechanism, elucidated by Meselson and Stahl, involves unwinding of the parental double helix by helicases, aided by single-strand binding proteins (SSBs) to prevent reannealing.  Topoisomerases alleviate torsional stress generated during unwinding.  Leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously by DNA polymerase III, utilizing a primer synthesized by primase.  Lagging strand synthesis, occurring discontinuously in Okazaki fragments, requires repeated primer synthesis and subsequent removal by RNase H and DNA polymerase I.  DNA ligase then joins the fragments, creating a continuous strand.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading activity inherent to DNA polymerases, as well as mismatch repair systems that correct post-replicative errors.  Telomeres, repetitive sequences at chromosome ends, pose a unique challenge due to the inability of DNA polymerase to replicate the 5' end. Telomerase, a reverse transcriptase, maintains telomere length in germ cells and some somatic cells.  Disruptions in this intricate process can lead to genomic instability, contributing to various diseases, including cancer.  Further research focuses on understanding the complex interplay of proteins involved and the implications of replication errors in disease pathogenesis.
