Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, remains a crucial process in energy production and scientific research.  However, experimental investigation of fission processes presents significant challenges across various scales.  Precise measurement of fission fragment yields and kinetic energies requires sophisticated detector systems capable of handling high radiation fluxes and accurately identifying a wide range of fission products, including short-lived isotopes.  Furthermore, elucidating the complex dynamics of the fission process itself demands high-precision measurements of pre-scission and post-scission neutron and gamma emission, often requiring advanced techniques like neutron time-of-flight spectroscopy and gamma-ray spectroscopy.  Investigating sub-barrier fission necessitates extremely sensitive detection capabilities to account for low fission probabilities.  Simulating fission dynamics via theoretical models faces obstacles in accurately representing nuclear structure and the complex interplay of collective and single-particle degrees of freedom.  Overcoming these experimental challenges through the development of novel detector technologies and advanced data analysis techniques is vital for a deeper understanding of fission dynamics and its applications in nuclear science and technology.
