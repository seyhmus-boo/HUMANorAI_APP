Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Initially a theoretical concept, its practical realization stemmed from the work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, who observed barium isotopes following neutron bombardment of uranium.  Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch subsequently interpreted this as nuclear fission, explaining the significant energy release through Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.  This discovery spurred intense research, culminating in the Manhattan Project and the subsequent development of nuclear weapons.

The process relies on the instability of certain isotopes, primarily uranium-235 and plutonium-239, whose nuclei readily absorb neutrons, leading to an excited, unstable state.  This state rapidly decays, splitting the nucleus and releasing further neutrons. This chain reaction, crucial for sustained fission, forms the basis of nuclear reactors.  The specific fission products vary, resulting in a complex mixture of radioactive isotopes.  Control over the chain reaction is achieved through neutron moderation and absorption, ensuring a controlled energy release in reactors or a rapid, uncontrolled release in weapons.  The immense energy produced arises from the difference in mass between the initial nucleus and the fission products, converted into kinetic energy of the fragments and released neutrons.  Understanding the intricacies of fission cross-sections and neutron interactions remains a crucial aspect of nuclear physics and reactor design.
