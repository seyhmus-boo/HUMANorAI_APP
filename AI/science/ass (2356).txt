Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  Unlike classical correlations, which can be explained by shared properties or pre-existing states, entanglement manifests as a superposition of coupled states, rendering individual system descriptions incomplete.  This interconnectedness implies that the measurement outcome of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, regardless of the spatial separation.  Mathematically, this is represented by a composite wavefunction that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each particle;  the system exists in a genuinely entangled state. The violation of Bell's inequalities experimentally confirms the existence of entanglement and its incompatibility with classical local realism, highlighting the non-locality inherent in quantum mechanics.  Furthermore, the degree of entanglement can be quantified using measures such as concurrence or entanglement entropy, providing insights into the strength of the correlation and its potential applications in quantum information processing, such as quantum computing and cryptography, where entangled states serve as fundamental resources.
