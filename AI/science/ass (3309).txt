Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, promising revolutionary advancements across diverse fields.  Their unique structure, analogous to a rolled-up sheet of graphene – a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice –  bestows upon them a remarkable combination of characteristics rarely found in other materials.  Imagine a material simultaneously possessing the strength of steel, yet being six times lighter, and exhibiting electrical conductivity rivaling copper. This is the compelling promise of CNTs.  Their exceptional tensile strength stems from the strong sp² hybridized carbon bonds, akin to tightly woven threads in a high-tensile fabric.  Furthermore, their electrical properties are highly dependent on their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's roll), behaving as either metallic conductors, comparable to a seamless copper wire, or as semiconductors, analogous to a carefully engineered silicon transistor.  This tunability, coupled with their high thermal conductivity – think of a highly efficient heat pipe – renders them exceptionally versatile for applications ranging from advanced composites to nanoelectronics. This paper delves into the fundamental properties of CNTs, exploring their structure-property relationships and highlighting their potential for transformative technological impact.
