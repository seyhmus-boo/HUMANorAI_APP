Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is a process underpinned by the strong and weak nuclear forces, and governed by quantum mechanical principles.  This exothermic reaction releases a significant quantity of energy, primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  The process typically initiates with the absorption of a neutron by a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, causing it to become unstable. This instability leads to the nucleus's deformation and eventual fission, yielding a range of possible fission fragment pairs, alongside the release of 2-3 additional neutrons. These secondary neutrons are crucial for sustaining a chain reaction, a key principle in nuclear reactors and weapons.  The energy release is a consequence of the mass defect, the difference between the mass of the original nucleus and the sum of the masses of the fission products, which is converted into energy according to Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ².  Control of the fission process, through neutron moderation and absorption, is essential for safe and efficient utilization of nuclear energy.
