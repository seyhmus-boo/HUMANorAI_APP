Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the fascinating phenomenon of quantum entanglement.  From a quantum mechanical perspective, entanglement arises when two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are correlated, regardless of spatial separation.  This correlation transcends classical intuition; measuring a property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the measurable properties of the others, even across vast distances.

This interconnectedness is described mathematically by a joint wavefunction that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each particle.  Instead, the entangled state is a superposition of multiple possible outcomes for the combined system.  Crucially, the measurement of a specific observable on one particle collapses the entangled wavefunction, instantaneously determining the corresponding observable's value for the other particle(s), regardless of distance.  This apparent instantaneous correlation does not violate special relativity as no information is transmitted faster than light. The strong correlations are established during the entanglement process, not during the measurement. This non-local behavior remains a profound area of research, pushing the boundaries of our understanding of quantum mechanics and its implications for information science and beyond.
