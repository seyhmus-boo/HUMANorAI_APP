The formation of black holes, singularities predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity, remains a pivotal area of astrophysical research.  While the theoretical framework is well-established, the precise mechanisms and observational confirmation of black hole genesis continue to be refined. This paper explores the current understanding of black hole formation, focusing on recent advancements that challenge and expand upon traditional models.  Historically, stellar-mass black holes were considered to arise primarily from the gravitational collapse of massive stars at the end of their lifecycle. However, recent gravitational wave detections by LIGO and Virgo have provided unprecedented insights into the mergers of binary black holes, suggesting a potentially higher prevalence of these systems than previously anticipated, prompting renewed investigation into their formation pathways.  Furthermore, advancements in numerical relativity allow for more accurate simulations of the complex hydrodynamic processes involved in stellar collapse, including the impact of magnetic fields and rotation.  Finally, the observation and characterization of supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies continue to pose significant challenges, demanding exploration of alternative formation scenarios, such as direct collapse and seed black hole growth. This paper will synthesize these recent developments, highlighting the key outstanding questions and future directions for research in this dynamic field.
