Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars.  Early theoretical work, notably by Oppenheimer and Snyder in the 1930s, laid the groundwork, demonstrating that sufficiently massive stars, lacking sufficient outward pressure to counteract their own gravity after exhausting nuclear fuel, inevitably collapse to a singularity.  This initial theoretical understanding lacked observational confirmation for decades.

The subsequent discovery of quasars in the 1960s, immensely luminous objects powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes, provided crucial indirect evidence.  Direct observational techniques advanced significantly with the advent of improved telescopes and interferometry, enabling the detection of stellar-mass black holes through their gravitational influence on companion stars, and more recently, the imaging of the event horizon of M87*.

Formation pathways are complex and depend on stellar mass and metallicity.  Stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses directly collapse into black holes following core-collapse supernovae, while less massive stars may form black holes via fallback accretion following a supernova, or through mergers of neutron stars.  Supermassive black holes, found at galactic centers, likely formed through a combination of seed black holes and continuous accretion, though the precise mechanisms remain an active area of research, encompassing scenarios like direct collapse and runaway mergers.  Further investigation into these processes is vital to advancing our comprehension of galactic evolution and the universe's large-scale structure.
