DNA replication, the precise duplication of the genome, is fundamental to life.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of the core mechanisms of eukaryotic DNA replication, focusing on recent advancements in our understanding of this crucial process. We will explore the intricate interplay of proteins involved, including the replisome components and their dynamic regulation.  Recent high-resolution structural studies have illuminated the architecture of the replication fork, shedding light on the mechanisms of leading and lagging strand synthesis and the coordination between polymerases.  Furthermore, we will discuss significant progress in elucidating the role of chromatin structure in replication initiation and progression, including the impact of epigenetic modifications on replication timing and fidelity.  Emerging techniques like single-molecule imaging have provided unprecedented insights into the dynamics of replication fork movement and its response to replication stress, revealing the intricate mechanisms employed to maintain genomic stability.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the implications of our expanding knowledge of DNA replication for understanding disease pathogenesis and the development of novel therapeutic strategies.
