Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery in physics with profound technological implications.  Initially theorized in the 1930s, the process was experimentally confirmed by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, following neutron bombardment of uranium, a finding interpreted by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch as nuclear fission. This breakthrough revealed the immense energy locked within the atomic nucleus, a consequence of the mass defect described by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence.

Fission reactions are typically induced by thermal or fast neutrons, leading to the release of further neutrons, enabling chain reactions.  The control of these chain reactions is crucial for nuclear power generation, where controlled fission sustains a self-sustaining reaction within a reactor core, producing heat utilized to generate electricity. Conversely, uncontrolled chain reactions underpin the destructive power of nuclear weapons.  Different fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, exhibit varying fission cross-sections and neutron yields, influencing reactor design and weapon efficacy.  Understanding the intricacies of neutron moderation, critical mass, and reactor kinetics remains essential for both energy production and nuclear safeguards.
