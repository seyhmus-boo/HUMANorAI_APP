Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the interplay of the strong and electromagnetic forces, described by a complex many-body Hamiltonian that defies exact analytical solution.  The wave function of the nucleus, a solution to this Hamiltonian, represents the probability amplitude of finding the nucleons (protons and neutrons) in specific spatial configurations.  Spontaneous fission occurs when the ground state wave function of the nucleus has a significant amplitude extending into configurations corresponding to separated fission fragments.  This tunneling probability is exponentially dependent on the potential energy barrier separating the initial nucleus and the fission fragments, highlighting the inherently probabilistic nature of the process.  Induced fission, initiated by neutron absorption, involves a transition to a higher energy state, often a resonance, which significantly increases the probability of overcoming the fission barrier through quantum tunneling.  The subsequent descent along the potential energy surface towards the separated fragments is governed by collective nuclear dynamics, described by coupled Schr√∂dinger equations for the collective coordinates, such as deformation parameters.  The precise energy partitioning between the fragments and emitted neutrons is similarly determined by the quantum mechanical wave function governing the final state.
