The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are fundamentally rooted in their quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp²-hybridized carbon atoms arranged in a seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheet result in a unique electronic band structure highly dependent on the nanotube's chirality (defined by the chiral vector (n,m)).  Armchair nanotubes (n=m) exhibit metallic conductivity due to the presence of a linear dispersion relation near the Fermi level, directly resulting from the symmetry of their electronic structure and leading to high electrical conductivity. In contrast, zigzag (n=0 or m=0) and chiral nanotubes (n≠m, n≠0) can exhibit either metallic or semiconducting behavior, with the band gap varying significantly depending on their diameter and chiral angle. This gap arises from the quantization of electronic states within the confined one-dimensional geometry, a direct consequence of quantum confinement effects.  Furthermore, the strong covalent bonds within the graphene lattice, combined with the cylindrical structure, contribute to exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, exceeding that of steel on a weight basis.  These quantum mechanical origins underpin the diverse applications of CNTs in electronics, materials science, and nanotechnology.  The precise tailoring of electronic and mechanical properties through controlled synthesis remains a central focus of ongoing research.
