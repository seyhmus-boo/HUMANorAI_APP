Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms.  This presentation will explore the key physical and chemical properties that render CNTs attractive for a wide range of applications.  We will discuss their exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness, surpassing that of steel, and their remarkable electrical conductivity, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality.  Furthermore, the high aspect ratio and large surface area of CNTs contribute to their excellent thermal conductivity and adsorption capabilities.

The presentation will briefly review the historical development of CNT research, highlighting the transition from initial characterization to the current advancements in controlled synthesis and functionalization techniques.  We will examine the challenges associated with CNT processing and scalability, including issues related to dispersion and purification.  Finally, we will briefly outline promising future applications of CNTs, such as in composites, electronics, energy storage, and biomedical devices, emphasizing the ongoing efforts to harness their exceptional properties for technological advancements.
