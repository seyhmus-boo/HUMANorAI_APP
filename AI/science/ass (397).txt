Nuclear fission, the process of splitting heavy atomic nuclei to release immense energy, remains a crucial topic in energy production and scientific research. This presentation will provide a concise overview of fundamental fission processes, focusing on the underlying physics and the role of neutron interactions.  We will discuss the various fissionable isotopes, highlighting their unique characteristics and contributions to reactor design and operation.

Recent developments in fission research will be a key focus.  This includes advancements in accelerator-driven systems (ADS) aimed at improving fuel efficiency and transmutation of radioactive waste, offering pathways towards a more sustainable nuclear fuel cycle. We will also address progress in the understanding and modeling of fission fragment yields, crucial for accurate reactor simulations and safety assessments.  Furthermore, the presentation will touch upon innovative reactor designs exploring novel concepts like molten salt reactors and fast reactors, which aim to enhance safety, efficiency, and waste management.  Finally, the ongoing challenges and future directions of fission research, including the need for robust theoretical models and advanced experimental techniques, will be briefly discussed. This presentation aims to provide a comprehensive yet accessible overview of the dynamic field of nuclear fission and its evolving role in the global energy landscape.
