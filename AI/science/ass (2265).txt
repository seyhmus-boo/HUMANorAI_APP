DNA replication, the fundamental process underpinning life, remains a subject of intense investigation.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of the core mechanisms of DNA replication, focusing on the interplay between the replisome components and the intricate regulation ensuring high fidelity and efficiency.  We will examine the roles of key enzymes, including DNA polymerases, helicases, and primases, highlighting their structural dynamics and functional interplay.

Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of several key areas.  High-resolution structural studies, coupled with single-molecule approaches, are revealing unprecedented details about the replisome's architecture and the dynamics of nucleotide incorporation. Furthermore, innovative techniques are elucidating the mechanisms of replication fork progression through challenging genomic regions such as highly repetitive sequences and difficult-to-replicate structures.  We will discuss emerging insights into the complexities of replication-associated DNA repair pathways and the consequences of replication stress, linking these processes to genome instability and disease.  Finally, we will briefly touch upon the implications of these findings for developing novel therapeutic strategies targeting DNA replication in cancer cells.
