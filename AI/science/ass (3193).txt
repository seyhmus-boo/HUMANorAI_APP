Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon defying classical intuition.  Imagine two coins, magically linked.  If you flip one and it lands heads, the other *instantaneously* lands tails, regardless of the distance separating them. This is analogous to entangled particles.

These particles, such as photons or electrons, are linked in a superposition state.  Before measurement, their individual properties, like spin, are undefined.  They exist in a probabilistic haze, a blend of possibilities.  However, upon measuring the property of one particle, the entire entangled system collapses into a definite state. The correlated property of the other particle is instantly defined, even across vast interstellar distances.

This instantaneous correlation doesn't violate the speed of light, as no information is transmitted faster than light. The correlation was pre-established at the moment of entanglement.  The seemingly instantaneous nature arises from our classical understanding of separate, independent objects, failing to grasp the inherent interconnectedness at the quantum level.  This peculiar interconnectedness forms the basis for ongoing research in quantum computing and cryptography.
