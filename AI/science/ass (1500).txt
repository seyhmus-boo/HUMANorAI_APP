DNA replication, the semiconservative process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  The process initiates at specific origin sites where the enzyme helicase unwinds the double helix, creating a replication fork.  Single-stranded binding proteins prevent re-annealing, while topoisomerases alleviate torsional stress.  Primase then synthesizes short RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, the primary enzyme responsible for adding nucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction.  Leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously, while lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA, and DNA ligase seals the resultant nicks, creating a complete, replicated DNA molecule.  The remarkable fidelity of this process is maintained by the proofreading activity of DNA polymerases and various repair mechanisms.  Understanding DNA replication has profound practical applications, notably in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology, which amplifies specific DNA sequences for forensic science, diagnostics, and genetic research.  Furthermore, knowledge of replication mechanisms informs the development of novel anticancer drugs targeting enzymes crucial for DNA synthesis, thereby inhibiting uncontrolled cell proliferation.
