This presentation provides a concise overview of quantum entanglement from a fundamental quantum mechanical perspective.  We will explore the phenomenon as a direct consequence of the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of multi-partite quantum systems.  The presentation will begin by reviewing the mathematical formalism of entangled states, focusing on Bell states as canonical examples.  We will then discuss the non-classical correlations inherent in entangled systems, highlighting their violation of Bell inequalities and the impossibility of explaining these correlations using local hidden variable theories.  Furthermore, we will briefly touch upon the crucial role of entanglement in quantum information processing, particularly in quantum teleportation and quantum computation.  The presentation will conclude by addressing some open questions regarding the fundamental nature of entanglement and its potential applications in future technologies, including quantum communication networks and advanced sensing techniques.  The aim is to provide a clear, accessible introduction to this profoundly counter-intuitive yet crucial concept at the heart of modern quantum mechanics.
