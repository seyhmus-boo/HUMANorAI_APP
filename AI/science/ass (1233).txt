Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional characteristics driving extensive research.  Their unique structure, consisting of seamlessly bonded spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, results in extraordinary mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel at a significantly lower density.  This high tensile strength, coupled with remarkable flexibility, makes CNTs ideal for composite materials applications.  

Furthermore, CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, depending on chirality, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting materials. This tunable conductivity opens doors for applications in advanced electronics, including high-frequency transistors and flexible displays.  Recent developments have centred on scalable production methods and improved dispersion techniques for enhanced integration into practical devices.  Research into CNT-based biosensors and drug delivery systems is also progressing rapidly, leveraging their high surface area and biocompatibility.  However, challenges remain in consistently controlling CNT chirality and achieving large-scale, cost-effective production for widespread commercialization.
