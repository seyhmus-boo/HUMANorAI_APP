Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems wherein the quantum state of each system cannot be described independently of the others, even when spatially separated.  This inherent interconnectedness, first hinted at in Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen's 1935 paradox concerning the completeness of quantum mechanics, challenges classical notions of locality and realism.  The EPR paradox highlighted seemingly paradoxical implications of entanglement, suggesting either non-locality or incompleteness of the quantum description.  Experimental verification of Bell's inequalities, starting in the 1970s and continuing to this day with increasing sophistication, has decisively demonstrated the violation of classical correlations and confirmed the reality of entanglement.  This has profound implications for quantum information science, enabling applications such as quantum teleportation, quantum cryptography, and quantum computing.  Ongoing research focuses on expanding the scale and robustness of entanglement, exploring its fundamental limits, and leveraging it for technological advancement in various domains.  Understanding the intricacies of entanglement remains a crucial frontier in both fundamental and applied quantum physics.
