Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally governed by quantum mechanics.  The stability of a molecule arises from the lowering of the total energy of the system compared to the isolated constituent atoms.  This energy reduction is a consequence of the wave-like nature of electrons and the Pauli exclusion principle.  Atoms achieve lower energy configurations through the overlap of atomic orbitals, leading to the formation of molecular orbitals.  Constructive interference of atomic orbitals results in bonding molecular orbitals, which are lower in energy and accommodate shared electron density between nuclei.  Destructive interference generates antibonding orbitals, higher in energy and less stable.

The molecular structure, including bond lengths and angles, is determined by the spatial distribution of electrons within these molecular orbitals.  The shapes of molecular orbitals are dictated by the symmetry of the overlapping atomic orbitals and the number of electrons occupying them.  Furthermore, electron-electron repulsions and the effective nuclear charge also influence molecular geometry, favoring configurations that minimize these interactions.  Advanced computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) and ab initio calculations provide increasingly accurate predictions of molecular structures and properties based on this quantum mechanical framework.
