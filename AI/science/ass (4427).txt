DNA replication, the semiconservative process of producing two identical DNA molecules from a single parental molecule, is fundamental to life.  The process initiates at origins of replication, where DNA helicases unwind the double helix, creating replication forks.  Single-strand binding proteins stabilize the separated strands, while topoisomerases relieve torsional stress.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, which adds deoxyribonucleotides in the 5' to 3' direction, leading to leading and lagging strand synthesis.  The lagging strand is synthesized discontinuously as Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA, and DNA ligase seals the nicks between fragments.

Recent advancements refine our understanding of this process.  Studies utilizing single-molecule techniques have elucidated the dynamics of replication fork progression, revealing pauses and reversals influenced by DNA structure and epigenetic modifications.  Furthermore, research into the replisome, the complex of proteins involved in replication, has unveiled intricate regulatory mechanisms ensuring fidelity and efficiency.  Advances in cryo-electron microscopy have provided high-resolution structural details of key enzymes, enhancing our comprehension of their catalytic mechanisms and interactions.  These developments are crucial for comprehending replication errors and their contributions to genomic instability and disease.
