Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that make them attractive for a wide range of applications.  Their high aspect ratio and spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure contribute to tensile strengths exceeding those of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility and elasticity.  Depending on chirality, CNTs can behave as metallic conductors or semiconducting materials, offering tunable electronic properties.  This tunability, alongside their high carrier mobility, makes them promising candidates for nanoelectronics and sensing applications.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit exceptionally high thermal conductivity, surpassing that of many metals, rendering them suitable for thermal management systems.  However, challenges remain, including the control of CNT chirality and diameter distribution during synthesis, as well as the efficient dispersion and functionalization of CNTs for integration into composite materials.  Ongoing research focuses on addressing these challenges to unlock the full potential of CNTs across diverse fields, from advanced materials to biomedical engineering.  This review highlights the key properties of CNTs and outlines current research directions aimed at optimizing their synthesis and application.
