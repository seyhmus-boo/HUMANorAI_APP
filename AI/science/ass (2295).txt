DNA replication is the fundamental process by which cells duplicate their genetic material, ensuring accurate transmission of hereditary information during cell division.  This semi-conservative process involves unwinding the double helix by helicases, exposing the template strands.  DNA polymerases then synthesize new complementary strands, adding nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, guided by base-pairing rules (adenine with thymine, guanine with cytosine).  Leading strands are synthesized continuously, while lagging strands are formed in discontinuous Okazaki fragments, later joined by ligase.  High fidelity is ensured through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerase.

Errors during replication can lead to mutations, driving evolution but also contributing to disease.  Understanding DNA replication is crucial for numerous applications.  Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) exploits this process to amplify specific DNA sequences for diagnostic testing and forensic science.  Furthermore, knowledge of replication mechanisms informs the development of anti-cancer drugs targeting enzymes involved in DNA synthesis, and gene editing technologies rely on manipulating the replication machinery for precise genome modification.  Consequently, the intricacies of DNA replication remain a vibrant area of ongoing research with far-reaching implications.
