Quantum entanglement describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that they exhibit correlated behaviour, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation transcends classical physics; measuring a property of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the outcome of measuring the corresponding property of the other, even if they are light-years apart.  

This arises from the superposition principle and the tensor product structure of the combined Hilbert space describing the entangled system. The composite system's state is not a simple product state of the individual subsystems but rather a superposition of entangled states.  The wavefunction describing the entangled pair is not separable, meaning it cannot be expressed as a product of individual wavefunctions for each particle.  Measurement of one particle's observable collapses the wavefunction of the entire entangled system, instantly determining the corresponding observable of the other particle, regardless of distance.  This non-local correlation, while not allowing faster-than-light communication, challenges our classical intuitions about locality and realism.  The precise mechanisms underlying entanglement remain a subject of ongoing investigation and debate.
