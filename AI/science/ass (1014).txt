Good morning. Today's lecture concerns catalysts in organic chemistry.  Imagine a mountain pass:  a high-energy barrier between reactants (the starting point) and products (the destination).  Reactions require surmounting this barrier, necessitating a substantial input of energy – the activation energy.  Catalysts, however, act as skilled mountaineers, providing an alternative, lower-energy pathway.  They do not alter the overall energy difference between reactants and products – the thermodynamic landscape remains unchanged – but significantly reduce the activation energy required.

This is achieved through the formation of intermediate complexes, akin to establishing temporary campsites along the mountain path.  These complexes lower the energetic hurdles at each stage of the reaction.  Crucially, catalysts are regenerated at the end of the reaction, emerging unscathed, like experienced mountaineers completing the ascent and descending to guide further expeditions.  Their presence dramatically accelerates the reaction rate, enhancing efficiency and selectivity towards specific products.  The understanding and application of catalysts are paramount to efficient and sustainable organic synthesis.
