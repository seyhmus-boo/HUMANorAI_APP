Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, constitutes a fundamental process underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry.  This process typically involves the bombardment of a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with a neutron.  Neutron absorption leads to an unstable, highly energetic intermediate nucleus, which subsequently undergoes asymmetric fission, fragmenting into two lighter daughter nuclei.  This fission event is accompanied by the release of a significant amount of energy, primarily stemming from the mass defect between the parent and daughter nuclei, as described by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²).  Furthermore, several additional neutrons are emitted, facilitating a chain reaction if sufficient fissile material is present.  The probability of fission occurring is dependent on the neutron's energy, with thermal neutrons being particularly effective in inducing fission in U-235.  Control of this chain reaction, through neutron moderation and absorption, is crucial for the safe and efficient operation of nuclear reactors.  Variations in the fission process yield different daughter nuclei and neutron numbers, contributing to the complexity of nuclear waste management.
