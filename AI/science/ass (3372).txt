Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei into lighter ones, represents a pivotal discovery in 20th-century physics.  Initially theorized in the 1930s by physicists like Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, following experimental observations by Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, its potential was quickly recognized.  The process, induced primarily by neutron bombardment of fissile isotopes such as Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, releases vast amounts of energy governed by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²). This energy liberation stems from the difference in binding energy between the parent nucleus and its fission fragments.

The chain reaction, a self-sustaining sequence of fissions initiated by a single neutron, is crucial for harnessing fission's energy.  This necessitates achieving criticality, where the rate of neutron production exceeds the rate of neutron loss.  Control over this chain reaction is essential for both nuclear power generation and weaponry, necessitating sophisticated reactor designs and safety protocols.  While fission power offers a significant energy source, concerns surrounding nuclear waste disposal and the potential for catastrophic accidents remain significant challenges.
