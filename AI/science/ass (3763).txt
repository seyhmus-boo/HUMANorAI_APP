Black hole formation is a consequence of extreme gravitational collapse.  Massive stars, exceeding approximately three times the solar mass, exhaust their nuclear fuel, leading to a cessation of outward pressure counteracting gravity.  This initiates a runaway implosion.  If the stellar remnant's mass surpasses the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit – the maximum mass a neutron star can sustain – the collapse continues unimpeded, eventually forming a singularity, a point of infinite density, surrounded by an event horizon.  Beyond this horizon, not even light can escape the immense gravitational pull.

Less massive stars form white dwarfs or neutron stars instead, lacking the sufficient mass to overcome neutron degeneracy pressure and initiate black hole formation. Supermassive black holes, found at galactic centers, likely originate through a combination of stellar-mass black hole mergers and direct gas accretion, though their precise formation mechanisms remain an active area of research.  

Understanding black hole formation is crucial for astrophysical modeling of galactic evolution and cosmology. Practically, the study of black holes informs the development of advanced gravitational wave detectors like LIGO, allowing us to observe mergers and thus refine our understanding of gravity in extreme environments.  Furthermore, their influence on accretion disks presents potential avenues for high-energy astrophysics research and technological advancements in areas like plasma physics.
