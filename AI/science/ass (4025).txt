DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding, predating the elucidation of DNA's double helix structure, hinted at a semi-conservative mechanism.  Meselson and Stahl's seminal 1958 experiment, using isotopic labelling of nitrogen, definitively proved this model, demonstrating that each new DNA molecule comprises one parental and one newly synthesized strand.  This discovery laid the foundation for subsequent research into the intricate molecular machinery involved.

The process initiates at specific origins of replication, where DNA helicases unwind the double helix, creating replication forks.  Single-strand binding proteins stabilize the separated strands, while topoisomerases relieve torsional stress.  Primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase III, the main enzyme responsible for adding nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction.  Leading strand synthesis proceeds continuously, while lagging strand synthesis occurs discontinuously, generating Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers and replaces them with DNA, and DNA ligase seals the nicks between fragments.  The remarkable fidelity of replication is maintained through proofreading activity of polymerases and various repair mechanisms.  Understanding DNA replication remains a critical area of study, with ongoing investigations into its regulation and role in genome stability and evolution.
