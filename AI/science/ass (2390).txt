Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, present significant challenges for experimental characterization.  Their high aspect ratio and tendency to agglomerate complicate accurate measurements of individual nanotube properties.  Precise determination of chirality, crucial for predicting electronic behavior, remains a significant hurdle, requiring advanced techniques like high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) which are prone to sample preparation artifacts and beam damage.  Furthermore, achieving homogenous dispersions of CNTs in various matrices for composite material studies is difficult due to strong van der Waals forces, leading to inconsistent experimental results.  Accurate measurement of tensile strength, a key mechanical property, is hampered by challenges in gripping and aligning individual nanotubes during testing.  Similarly, thermal conductivity measurements are complicated by phonon scattering at defects and interfaces, while electrical conductivity studies face difficulties in eliminating contact resistance and ensuring consistent current flow. These experimental limitations necessitate the development of increasingly sophisticated techniques and refined data analysis methods for accurate and reliable characterization of CNT properties.
