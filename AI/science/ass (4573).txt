The formation of black holes, astrophysical objects of immense gravitational pull, remains a significant area of research at the intersection of general relativity and quantum mechanics.  While classical general relativity provides a robust framework for describing the macroscopic properties of black holes, their formation and ultimate fate necessitate a deeper understanding incorporating quantum effects.  This paper explores the crucial role quantum mechanics plays in elucidating the process of black hole formation, moving beyond the purely classical picture.  Specifically, we examine the limitations of classical descriptions in explaining the singularity at the black hole's core and the information paradox.  We will analyze the implications of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, focusing on Hawking radiation as a key manifestation of quantum effects near the event horizon. Further, we investigate the potential contributions of loop quantum gravity and other approaches attempting to quantize gravity in resolving the singularity problem and providing a more complete theoretical framework for black hole formation.  By examining these quantum mechanical perspectives, we aim to shed light on the fundamental physics governing the birth and evolution of these enigmatic cosmic objects and ultimately bridge the gap between general relativity and quantum mechanics.
