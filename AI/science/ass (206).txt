Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, the fundamental process by which life perpetuates itself.  Imagine DNA as a meticulously written instruction manual, a double helix composed of two complementary strands.  Replication is akin to creating a perfect copy of this manual.  The process begins with the unwinding of the double helix, like unzipping a zipper, separating the two strands.  Each strand then acts as a template, guiding the synthesis of a new complementary strand.  Think of this as using one half of the instruction manual to write out the missing half.

This synthesis is achieved by enzymes, particularly DNA polymerase, which adds nucleotides – the individual "letters" of the genetic code – in a precise sequence dictated by the template strand. This process is highly accurate, employing proofreading mechanisms to minimize errors. The end result? Two identical DNA molecules, each consisting of one original and one newly synthesized strand – a semi-conservative model, like having one parent and one identical twin.  This ensures faithful transmission of genetic information during cell division, maintaining the continuity of life.
