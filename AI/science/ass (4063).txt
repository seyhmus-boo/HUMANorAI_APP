Black hole formation is a consequence of extreme gravitational collapse within astrophysical environments.  Stars significantly exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit (approximately 1.4 solar masses) exhaust their nuclear fuel, ceasing the outward pressure counteracting gravity. This initiates a catastrophic inward collapse, driven by the star's immense self-gravity.  For sufficiently massive stars, this collapse proceeds unimpeded, overcoming even neutron degeneracy pressure, ultimately resulting in a singularity—a point of infinite density—surrounded by an event horizon from which not even light can escape.  This forms a stellar-mass black hole.  Alternatively, supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, are believed to form through accretion of matter and mergers of smaller black holes, although their precise formation mechanisms remain a subject of ongoing research.

The theoretical understanding of black hole formation underpins various practical applications.  Advanced modelling of stellar evolution incorporating general relativity is crucial for predicting supernovae and gravitational wave signals from merging black holes, which are detected by observatories like LIGO and Virgo.  These observations refine our understanding of stellar-mass black hole populations and their contribution to galactic evolution. Furthermore, the accretion disks surrounding black holes are studied to understand high-energy astrophysical phenomena like quasars, providing insights into the physical processes occurring at extreme conditions relevant to fundamental physics research.
