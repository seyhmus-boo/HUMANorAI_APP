Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have spurred significant interest for diverse applications.  This presentation will overview the key characteristics of CNTs, including their remarkably high tensile strength, Young's modulus exceeding that of steel, and tunable electrical conductivity ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour depending on chirality.  Their high aspect ratio and large surface area also contribute to unique functionalities.  We will explore the influence of structural parameters, such as diameter and chirality, on these properties.

The superior properties of CNTs translate into a wide array of potential applications.  Their exceptional strength makes them suitable for reinforcement in composite materials for aerospace and automotive industries. Their high electrical conductivity enables their use in transparent conductive films for touchscreens and solar cells, while their thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation in electronics.  Furthermore, their large surface area finds use in energy storage devices like supercapacitors and batteries, and in advanced sensing applications.  This presentation will conclude by discussing current challenges and future directions in CNT research and development, focusing on scalable production methods and the integration of CNTs into commercially viable products.
