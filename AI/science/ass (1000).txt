Good morning. Today's lecture concerns quantum entanglement, a phenomenon with profound implications spanning physics, computer science, and even philosophy.  Entanglement describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  Crucially, measuring the state of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the state of the others, a seemingly paradoxical violation of locality as understood in classical physics.

This non-classical correlation has significant interdisciplinary reach.  In physics, entanglement underpins quantum cryptography, enabling secure communication protocols impossible with classical methods.  Computer science benefits from its application in quantum computing, offering exponential speedups for specific algorithms. The theoretical potential of quantum teleportation, leveraging entanglement to transmit quantum states, further underscores its technological significance.  Philosophically, entanglement challenges our understanding of realism and locality, prompting ongoing debates about the nature of reality and information itself.  The exploration of entanglement thus presents a fertile ground for interdisciplinary collaboration, pushing the boundaries of our scientific and philosophical comprehension.
