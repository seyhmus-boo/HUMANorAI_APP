CRISPR-Cas systems, revolutionizing genetic engineering, have rapidly transitioned from a prokaryotic defense mechanism to a precise genome editing tool. This presentation will trace the historical evolution of CRISPR technology, beginning with its discovery as a bacterial adaptive immune system in the early 2000s.  Initial observations of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and their associated Cas genes highlighted their role in defending against bacteriophages.  Subsequent research elucidated the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas systems, revealing their ability to target and cleave specific DNA sequences guided by CRISPR RNA (crRNA).  This understanding paved the way for the adaptation of these systems for targeted genome engineering in eukaryotic cells.

The presentation will then explore the significant advancements in CRISPR technology, including the development of simplified systems like CRISPR-Cas9 and its various iterations,  allowing for increased efficiency and reduced off-target effects.  Furthermore, it will briefly discuss the broad applications of CRISPR, encompassing disease modelling, gene therapy, crop improvement, and synthetic biology.  Finally, ethical considerations and ongoing challenges associated with the widespread use of this powerful technology will be briefly addressed, emphasizing the importance of responsible innovation in this rapidly evolving field.
