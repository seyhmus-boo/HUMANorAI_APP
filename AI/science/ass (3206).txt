Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms.  These structures, categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) depending on the number of concentric cylinders, exhibit extraordinary mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel on a weight basis.  Their high aspect ratio and exceptional electron mobility contribute to exceptional electrical conductivity, tunable from metallic to semiconducting depending on chirality and diameter.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate high thermal conductivity, exceeding that of diamond in certain orientations.  These properties have propelled extensive research into their potential applications in diverse fields.  However, challenges remain, including controlling nanotube chirality and achieving scalable, cost-effective production methods for high purity CNTs.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these limitations and realizing the full potential of CNTs in advanced composites, electronics, sensors, and energy storage devices. The long-term prospects for CNT integration depend on addressing challenges related to toxicity and dispersion, while maximizing the exploitation of their multifaceted properties.
