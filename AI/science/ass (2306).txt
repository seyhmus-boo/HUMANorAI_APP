Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure.  Their exceptionally high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel by several orders of magnitude, coupled with remarkable flexibility, makes them attractive for reinforcing composites.  The electrical conductivity of CNTs is strongly dependent on chirality and diameter, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour.  Metallic CNTs possess conductivities comparable to copper, while semiconducting CNTs exhibit band gaps tunable through structural modification, offering potential for applications in nanoelectronics.  Furthermore, CNTs demonstrate exceptionally high thermal conductivity along their axial direction, surpassing that of many conventional materials, making them promising candidates for thermal management applications.  These properties, alongside their high aspect ratio and large surface area, contribute to the versatility of CNTs across a wide range of fields, including materials science, electronics, and energy storage. However, challenges remain in controlling the synthesis and dispersion of CNTs for optimal exploitation of their inherent capabilities.
