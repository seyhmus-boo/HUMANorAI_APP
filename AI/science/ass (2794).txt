Good morning. Today's lecture concerns the intriguing phenomenon of quantum entanglement.  From a quantum mechanical perspective, entanglement describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  These systems, even when spatially separated, exhibit a unified quantum state.  Crucially, this isn't simply a matter of correlated classical properties; rather, the entangled particles exist in a superposition of states, described by a single, composite wavefunction.  

Measurement on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, regardless of distance. This apparent violation of locality is a key feature, and a source of ongoing debate,  leading to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen paradox.  Mathematically, the entangled state cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions for each subsystem; it's a holistic description.  The strong correlations observed defy classical explanations and demonstrate the fundamentally non-local nature of quantum mechanics.  We'll further explore the implications for quantum computing and communication in subsequent lectures.
