Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991 using transmission electron microscopy, exhibit exceptional material properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure.  These cylindrical structures, essentially rolled-up graphene sheets, exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs), each possessing distinct characteristics.  Their remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile strength exceeding that of steel, arises from the strong covalent bonds within the hexagonal lattice.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's rolling). This tunable conductivity is crucial for their application in electronics.  Their high aspect ratio leads to exceptionally high surface area, making them ideal for applications in catalysis, sensing, and energy storage.  Thermal conductivity is also exceptionally high, exceeding that of diamond in some configurations.  However, challenges remain, including controlled synthesis to achieve specific chirality and the development of effective dispersion methods for composite materials to fully exploit their potential in diverse technological domains.
