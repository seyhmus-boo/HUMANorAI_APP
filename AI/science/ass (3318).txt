Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon initially predicted by Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in their 1935 paradox, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems that persists even when spatially separated.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, manifesting as a non-local connection where the measurement outcome of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of another, regardless of the distance separating them.  The EPR paper argued that this apparent "spooky action at a distance," as Einstein famously termed it, demonstrated the incompleteness of quantum mechanics.  However, subsequent experimental work, notably Bell's theorem and subsequent experiments testing Bell inequalities, has conclusively demonstrated the reality of entanglement, refuting the EPR arguments for local realism.  Entanglement's origins lie in the superposition principle, where a quantum system exists in a combination of states until measured.  When two particles become entangled, their combined wave function describes a correlated state, meaning their individual states are undefined until a measurement is performed on one or both. This fundamental property is now a cornerstone of quantum information science, finding applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.
