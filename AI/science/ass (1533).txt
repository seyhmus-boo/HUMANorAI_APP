Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional physicochemical properties stemming from their unique one-dimensional structure and high aspect ratio.  This review summarizes key properties relevant to their diverse applications.  CNTs possess exceptionally high tensile strength and Young's modulus, surpassing those of steel, making them attractive for reinforcement in composite materials.  Their electrical conductivity varies significantly depending on chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, enabling applications in electronics and sensors.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation in microelectronics and thermal management systems.  Their large surface area contributes to significant adsorption capabilities, exploited in gas storage and environmental remediation.  However, challenges remain in achieving scalable, cost-effective production and controlling the precise chirality and structure for optimal performance in specific applications.  Future research should focus on addressing these challenges and further exploring the potential of CNTs in advanced materials science, nanotechnology, and energy applications.
