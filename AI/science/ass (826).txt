The understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure forms the cornerstone of modern chemistry, underpinning our ability to predict and explain the properties of matter.  Early attempts to rationalize chemical combinations, such as Dalton's atomic theory in the early 19th century, laid the groundwork by establishing the concept of discrete atoms combining in fixed ratios. However, these theories lacked a mechanism to explain the forces holding atoms together.  The advent of quantum mechanics in the 20th century revolutionized this field, providing the theoretical framework necessary to describe the nature of chemical bonds.  The pioneering work of Lewis, with his electron dot structures, offered a simplified yet insightful model explaining covalent bonding through shared electron pairs.  Subsequent developments, including the valence bond theory and the molecular orbital theory, provided increasingly sophisticated descriptions of bond formation, accounting for concepts like hybridization and resonance.  This paper will explore the evolution of our understanding of chemical bonding, examining the key theoretical models – including their strengths and limitations – and their application in elucidating diverse molecular structures and properties. We will further discuss the impact of advanced computational techniques on predicting and understanding complex molecular systems.
