Good morning. Today's lecture concerns chemical bonding and its crucial influence on molecular structure.  Chemical bonding, the attractive force holding atoms together, arises primarily from electrostatic interactions between electrons and nuclei.  We'll primarily focus on covalent and ionic bonding. Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, leading to the formation of molecules with specific three-dimensional structures determined by factors like bond angles and bond lengths.  Ionic bonding, conversely, results from the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, forming crystalline lattices.

Understanding molecular structure is paramount, as it directly dictates a molecule's properties.  For instance, the tetrahedral structure of methane (CH₄) contrasts sharply with the linear structure of carbon dioxide (CO₂), resulting in vastly different physical and chemical behaviours.  These structural differences underpin crucial applications.  The precise arrangement of atoms in pharmaceuticals, for example, determines their biological activity, while the crystalline structure of silicon in microchips is essential for modern electronics.  Therefore, comprehending the relationship between chemical bonding and molecular structure is foundational to numerous scientific and technological advancements.
