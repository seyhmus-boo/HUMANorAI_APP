Black hole formation, a fascinating topic in astrophysics, hinges on the interplay of gravity and stellar evolution.  The process, fundamentally governed by general relativity, begins with stars significantly exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit (approximately 1.4 solar masses).  These massive stars, having exhausted their nuclear fuel, collapse under their own immense gravitational pull.  The fate of the stellar remnant depends critically on its mass.  If the mass surpasses the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (approximately 3 solar masses), even neutron degeneracy pressure proves insufficient to resist further collapse, resulting in a singularity â€“ the formation of a black hole.

This process has strong interdisciplinary links. Nuclear physics dictates the stellar lifespan and ultimate composition, influencing the pre-collapse mass.  Computational astrophysics, employing sophisticated numerical simulations, models the complex dynamics of the collapse, incorporating elements of fluid mechanics and general relativity.  Furthermore, observational astronomy, utilizing techniques from electromagnetic and gravitational wave detection, provides crucial data to constrain theoretical models and verify the existence of black holes across different mass scales, bridging theory with empirical evidence.
