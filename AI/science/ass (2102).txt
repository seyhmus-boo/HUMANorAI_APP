Black hole formation remains a central, yet experimentally challenging, problem in astrophysics.  Direct observational evidence is limited by the nature of these objects; their event horizons preclude the escape of electromagnetic radiation, rendering traditional astronomical methods inadequate for detailed study.  While gravitational wave observations offer promising insights into the merger of stellar-mass black holes, these events represent a late stage in their life cycle, obscuring the initial collapse mechanisms.  Simulations based on general relativity provide valuable theoretical frameworks, but accurately modeling the complex astrophysical environment, including the progenitor star's composition, rotation, and magnetic fields, remains computationally demanding and introduces uncertainties.  Furthermore, distinguishing black hole formation from other dense, compact objects like neutron stars necessitates extremely high-precision measurements of gravitational waves and electromagnetic counterparts, which currently lie beyond the capabilities of existing instruments.  Future advancements in gravitational wave detectors, along with multi-messenger astronomy incorporating neutrino and electromagnetic observations, are crucial to overcoming these experimental limitations and advancing our understanding of black hole formation across the stellar and supermassive mass scales.
