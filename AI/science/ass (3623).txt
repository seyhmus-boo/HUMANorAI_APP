Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  Unlike classical correlations, entanglement transcends spatial separation, exhibiting strong correlations even when the entangled particles are widely distanced. This arises from the superposition principle; entangled particles exist in a combined quantum state, not as individual entities with definite properties.  Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously collapses the combined wavefunction, instantaneously determining the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them. This seemingly instantaneous correlation doesn't violate special relativity because no information is transmitted faster than light; the outcome of a measurement on one particle is inherently probabilistic until a measurement is performed.  Entanglement is mathematically described using tensor products of Hilbert spaces, where the composite system's state cannot be factored into individual state vectors.  Bell's theorem rigorously demonstrates the incompatibility of entanglement with local realism, highlighting the profound departure of quantum mechanics from classical intuition.  This phenomenon has significant implications for quantum computing, cryptography, and the fundamental understanding of quantum measurement.
