Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems exhibit correlated behaviour regardless of spatial separation.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, violating Bell's inequalities and showcasing the non-local nature of quantum mechanics.  From a quantum mechanical perspective, entangled particles are described by a single, composite wavefunction, preventing individual state assignment. Measurement on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the others, irrespective of the distance separating them, a feature Einstein famously termed "spooky action at a distance."

This non-classical correlation stems from the superposition principle; entangled particles exist in a superposition of states until measured.  Upon measurement, the wavefunction collapses, instantaneously determining the states of all entangled particles, implying a fundamental interconnectedness exceeding classical notions of locality.  The practical implications are substantial, underpinning quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation. However, the exact nature of entanglement, especially its compatibility with relativity, remains a subject of ongoing research and debate, highlighting the fundamental mysteries inherent in the quantum realm.  Further investigation into its intricacies promises significant advancements in our understanding of the universe at its most fundamental level.
