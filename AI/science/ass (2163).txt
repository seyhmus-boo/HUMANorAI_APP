DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early experiments, notably the Meselson-Stahl experiment (1958), demonstrated the semi-conservative nature of replication â€“ each new DNA molecule retains one parental strand.  This foundational discovery elucidated the mechanism by which genetic information is faithfully transmitted across generations.  The process is initiated at specific origins of replication, where DNA helicases unwind the double helix, creating replication forks.  Single-strand binding proteins stabilize the unwound strands, preventing reannealing.  DNA primase synthesizes RNA primers, providing a 3'-OH group for DNA polymerase to initiate synthesis.  DNA polymerase III, the primary replicative enzyme, adds nucleotides in a 5' to 3' direction, leading to continuous synthesis on the leading strand and discontinuous synthesis on the lagging strand, resulting in Okazaki fragments.  DNA polymerase I removes RNA primers, and DNA ligase joins the Okazaki fragments.  The high fidelity of replication is ensured by proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases and various repair pathways.  Understanding the intricacies of DNA replication remains crucial for addressing issues in genetic instability, disease, and biotechnology applications, including genome editing and cloning.
