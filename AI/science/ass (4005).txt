Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamental concepts in chemistry, explaining the arrangement of atoms and the forces holding them together.  Early understanding, rooted in Dalton's atomic theory (early 19th century), initially lacked a mechanistic explanation for bonding.  The advent of quantum mechanics in the 20th century revolutionized the field, providing a theoretical basis for various bond types.  The valence bond theory, focusing on the overlap of atomic orbitals, explains covalent bonds through the sharing of electron pairs.  Conversely, molecular orbital theory describes bonding through the combination of atomic orbitals to form molecular orbitals, accommodating delocalized electrons found in conjugated systems.

Molecular structure, dictated by bonding, defines a molecule's three-dimensional shape.  VSEPR theory (Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion) provides a simple model predicting molecular geometry based on minimizing electron-pair repulsions.  Factors such as bond lengths, bond angles, and dihedral angles further specify the structure, influencing the molecule's physical and chemical properties.  Ultimately, the interplay between chemical bonding and molecular structure is crucial for understanding reactivity, intermolecular forces, and macroscopic properties of matter.
