Good morning, class. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission, the process underpinning nuclear power generation.  Imagine a bowling ball, representing a heavy, unstable atomic nucleus, like Uranium-235.  This ball is precariously balanced on a hill.  Now, imagine a tiny marble, a neutron, striking the bowling ball. This impact disrupts the delicate balance, causing the bowling ball to split into two smaller balls, representing fission fragments, along with several more marbles, additional neutrons.  

These smaller balls possess considerable kinetic energy, analogous to the heat released in fission. The crucial aspect is the release of those extra neutrons. They act like a chain reaction, striking other unstable bowling balls, leading to a cascade of splitting and energy release.  Control is paramount.  Think of this as carefully controlling the slope of the hill and the number of marbles available.  In a nuclear reactor, control rods absorb neutrons, moderating the rate of fission to prevent an uncontrolled chain reaction, or what we call a nuclear meltdown.  Therefore, understanding the chain reaction is fundamental to understanding nuclear fission.
