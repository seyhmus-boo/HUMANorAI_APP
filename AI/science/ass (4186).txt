Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with cylindrical nanostructures, exhibit a unique confluence of exceptional properties relevant to numerous interdisciplinary fields.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from the strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds in their hexagonal lattice structure, makes them attractive for materials science applications, including the reinforcement of composites and the development of advanced nano-scale devices.  Simultaneously, their high aspect ratio and electronic properties, tunable between metallic and semiconducting behaviour depending on chirality, are pivotal for electronics and nanotechnology.  The high surface area of CNTs facilitates their use as catalysts and in energy storage devices like supercapacitors and batteries, bridging the gap between materials science and energy research.  Furthermore, their biocompatibility, when properly functionalized, opens avenues for biomedical engineering, enabling applications in drug delivery, biosensors, and tissue engineering.  This interdisciplinary reach underscores the versatility of CNTs, demanding collaborative efforts from chemists, physicists, materials scientists, engineers, and biologists to fully realize their potential across a range of technological advancements.
