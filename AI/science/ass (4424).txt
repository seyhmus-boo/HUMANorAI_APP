Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional properties, represent a compelling area of interdisciplinary research.  Their unique structural features, comprising seamlessly rolled graphene sheets, yield remarkable mechanical strength, surpassing that of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility and high tensile modulus.  This exceptional mechanical performance has implications across materials science and engineering, from reinforced composites to nanoscale devices.

Furthermore, CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality, opening avenues for applications in electronics and energy storage.  This electronic behavior is central to ongoing research in nanoelectronics and the development of high-performance transistors and sensors.  Their high surface area also facilitates their use in catalysis and energy applications, such as fuel cells and supercapacitors, creating links with chemistry and chemical engineering.

Finally, the biological interactions of CNTs are increasingly explored, forming a crucial bridge between nanotechnology and biomedicine.  Their biocompatibility and ability to functionalize with biomolecules are being exploited for drug delivery, biosensing, and tissue engineering.  Overall, the multifaceted properties of CNTs have fostered significant interdisciplinary collaborations, pushing boundaries across diverse scientific and engineering fields.
