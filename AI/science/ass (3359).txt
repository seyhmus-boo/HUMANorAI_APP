The understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure, fundamental to modern chemistry, evolved significantly throughout the 20th century, building upon earlier atomic theories.  Early attempts, such as the valence bond theory emerging from G.N. Lewis's concept of shared electron pairs, provided a rudimentary framework for explaining the stability of molecules.  However, these models struggled to fully account for the geometry and properties of more complex molecules.  The subsequent development of molecular orbital theory, drawing upon quantum mechanics, offered a more sophisticated and accurate description.  This theory postulates that atomic orbitals combine to form molecular orbitals, encompassing bonding, antibonding, and nonbonding interactions.  The resulting electron distribution within these molecular orbitals dictates the molecule's geometry, reactivity, and other physicochemical properties.  Furthermore, advancements in spectroscopic techniques, such as X-ray diffraction and NMR spectroscopy, provided experimental evidence supporting and refining theoretical models. This interplay between theoretical advancements and experimental verification has led to increasingly precise predictive capabilities in understanding and manipulating molecular structures, critical for fields ranging from materials science to drug design.
