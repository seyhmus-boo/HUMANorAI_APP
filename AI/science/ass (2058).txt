Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, possess a unique combination of properties engendering significant interdisciplinary interest.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, stemming from strong spÂ² hybridized carbon bonds, makes them attractive for materials science applications, from reinforcing composites to nano-scale devices.  Their high aspect ratio and electrical conductivity, tunable between metallic and semiconducting behaviour depending on chirality, are crucial for electronics and sensing.  Furthermore, their large surface area offers potential in energy storage (batteries, supercapacitors) and catalysis, bridging chemistry and materials science.  Biomedical engineering benefits from their biocompatibility and ability to functionalize with targeting moieties for drug delivery and imaging.  Finally, their thermal conductivity rivals that of diamond, making them relevant to thermal management in electronics and energy applications.  The multifaceted nature of CNT properties necessitates collaborative research across diverse fields for realizing their full potential.
