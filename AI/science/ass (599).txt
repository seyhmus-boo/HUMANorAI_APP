Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a groundbreaking class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms.  This presentation will explore the key characteristics that make CNTs attractive for diverse applications.  We will examine their remarkable mechanical strength, exceeding that of steel at a significantly lower density, and their exceptional electrical conductivity, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on chirality.  Their high aspect ratio and large surface area contribute to unique thermal properties, including high thermal conductivity along the nanotube axis.  Furthermore, the presentation will delve into the tunable electronic and optical properties of CNTs, influenced by diameter, length, and chirality, opening avenues for applications in electronics, photonics, and sensing. We will briefly discuss the challenges associated with CNT synthesis, purification, and functionalization, highlighting the ongoing research efforts aimed at controlling these parameters for optimized material performance.  Finally,  future research directions and potential applications of CNTs across diverse fields will be briefly outlined.
