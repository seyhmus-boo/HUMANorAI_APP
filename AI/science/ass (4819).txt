Catalysts are indispensable in modern organic chemistry, significantly impacting reaction efficiency, selectivity, and sustainability.  This review highlights the increasingly interdisciplinary nature of catalysis research.  The field draws heavily on inorganic chemistry, with the design and synthesis of novel metal complexes and metal nanoparticles crucial for developing highly active and selective catalysts.  Computational chemistry plays a vital role in predicting catalytic activity and mechanistic understanding, guiding the rational design of improved catalysts.  Furthermore, strong links exist with materials science, encompassing the development of heterogeneous catalysts supported on various materials like zeolites or metal-organic frameworks (MOFs).  These materials offer unique properties for controlling reaction pathways and enhancing catalyst stability.  The biological sciences also contribute significantly, with biocatalysis leveraging enzymes for highly specific and environmentally benign transformations.  Finally, the engineering disciplines are crucial for scaling-up catalytic processes and designing efficient reactor systems.  The integration of these diverse fields continues to propel advancements in organic synthesis, leading to more efficient and sustainable methods for producing valuable chemicals and pharmaceuticals.
