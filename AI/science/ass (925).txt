Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed entirely of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms, have captivated scientific interest since their discovery by Sumio Iijima in 1991. This discovery, initially observed as a byproduct of fullerene synthesis, unveiled a new class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties.  Early research focused primarily on characterizing the unique structure of CNTs, identifying their two primary forms: single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNTs), each exhibiting distinct characteristics.  The subsequent decades have witnessed an explosion in research exploring the remarkable mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of these nanostructures.  Their exceptional tensile strength, exceeding that of steel, coupled with remarkable flexibility and high electrical conductivity, makes CNTs highly attractive for a wide range of applications.  However, challenges remain in controlling the precise synthesis and scalable production of CNTs with desired chirality and structural uniformity.  This paper reviews the fundamental properties of carbon nanotubes, encompassing their structural characteristics, mechanical behavior, electronic properties, and thermal conductivity. Furthermore, it will examine current challenges and potential avenues for future research in harnessing the full potential of these versatile nanomaterials across diverse technological domains.
