The formation of black holes, predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity, remains a compelling area of astrophysical research. While classical general relativity provides a macroscopic description of black hole genesis through stellar collapse or galactic mergers, a complete understanding necessitates incorporating quantum mechanical effects, particularly at the singularity and in the highly energetic environments surrounding the event horizon.  This paper explores the intersection of quantum mechanics and black hole formation, acknowledging the inherent challenges in reconciling these disparate theoretical frameworks.  We will examine how quantum effects might influence the process of stellar collapse, focusing on the role of quantum gravity in resolving the singularity problem and modifying the classical picture of spacetime curvature.  Specifically, we will investigate the potential impact of quantum fluctuations on the stability of collapsing stars, exploring scenarios where quantum phenomena may delay or even prevent the formation of a classical singularity.  Furthermore, we will briefly discuss the relevance of Hawking radiation and its implications for information loss paradoxes, recognizing its role as a crucial bridge between quantum field theory and the classical black hole thermodynamics.  This investigation aims to provide an overview of current theoretical advancements and outstanding questions at the forefront of quantum-mechanical approaches to black hole formation.
