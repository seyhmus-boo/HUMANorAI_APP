Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This interconnectedness transcends classical correlations, manifesting as a non-local correlation between the observable properties of the entangled particles.  Mathematically, entanglement is represented by a composite quantum state that cannot be expressed as a tensor product of individual states for each subsystem.  Instead, the entangled state exists as a superposition of possible outcomes for the individual systems, described by a wavefunction that encompasses the entire entangled system.  Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously influences the outcome of the corresponding measurement on the other, even over vast distances, seemingly violating the principle of locality.  This instantaneous correlation, however, does not allow for faster-than-light communication as the outcome of the measurement on the individual particle remains probabilistic until measured. The implications of entanglement are profound, impacting areas such as quantum computing, cryptography, and our fundamental understanding of reality itself.  Further research continues to unravel the complexities and potential applications of this peculiar quantum phenomenon.
