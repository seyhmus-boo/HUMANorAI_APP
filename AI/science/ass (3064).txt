Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, have garnered significant attention due to their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.  Their unique atomic arrangement results in a remarkable combination of high tensile strength, superior elasticity, and excellent conductivity, far surpassing those of conventional materials.  This has fueled extensive research into their potential applications across diverse fields, ranging from advanced composites and electronics to energy storage and biomedical devices.

Recent developments have focused on refining synthesis techniques to control CNT chirality and diameter with greater precision, directly impacting their properties and facilitating the creation of tailored materials.  Furthermore, significant progress has been made in understanding and manipulating the interfacial interactions between CNTs and surrounding matrices, crucial for optimizing the performance of CNT-based composites.  This paper will review the fundamental properties of CNTs, focusing particularly on recent advancements in controlled synthesis, characterization techniques, and the exploitation of their unique attributes for applications in high-performance materials and nanoelectronics. We will also discuss the ongoing challenges and future directions in CNT research, including scalability and cost-effectiveness.
