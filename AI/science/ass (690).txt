Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991 using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure.  These cylindrical molecules, composed of rolled-up graphene sheets, exist as single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs).  Their exceptional mechanical strength, arising from the strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms, makes them significantly stronger than steel on a weight basis.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable electrical conductivity, behaving either as metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality (the angle of the graphene sheet's roll). This tunable conductivity is crucial for their applications in electronics.

Their high aspect ratio contributes to their superior thermal conductivity, exceeding that of most known materials.  Additionally, CNTs possess a large surface area, leading to excellent adsorption capabilities, utilized in various applications including gas storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain in their large-scale production and effective dispersion, necessitating further research to fully exploit their potential across diverse scientific and technological fields.
