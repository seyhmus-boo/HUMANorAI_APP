Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems exhibit correlated behavior regardless of spatial separation.  This correlation surpasses classical explanations, violating Bell's inequalities and demonstrating the non-locality inherent in quantum theory.  The entangled systems are described by a single, composite wavefunction, rather than individual wavefunctions, implying that their properties are intrinsically linked. Measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property on the other, irrespective of distance, leading to apparent "spooky action at a distance," as Einstein termed it.

This non-classical correlation arises from the superposition principle and the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum states.  Entanglement's robustness to decoherence remains a topic of active research, with various decoherence models attempting to explain the fragility of entanglement in open quantum systems.  Despite challenges in maintaining entanglement, its exploitation is crucial for developing quantum technologies such as quantum computing and quantum cryptography, where entanglement serves as a resource for superior computational power and unconditionally secure communication.  Further investigation into the fundamental nature of entanglement is vital for a comprehensive understanding of quantum mechanics and its technological applications.
