This review summarizes fundamental concepts in chemical bonding and molecular structure, encompassing ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding paradigms.  Emphasis is placed on the Valence Bond Theory (VBT) and Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT) as frameworks for predicting molecular geometry and properties.  VBT, while providing a conceptually accessible approach via hybridization and resonance, is limited in its predictive power for complex molecules and their electronic spectra.  Conversely, MOT, employing linear combinations of atomic orbitals, offers a more rigorous, albeit computationally demanding, description of bonding, particularly for conjugated systems and transition metal complexes.  The review highlights the relationship between molecular geometry and bond properties, including bond length, bond energy, and bond order, discussing their experimental determination techniques such as X-ray diffraction and spectroscopy.  Furthermore, the influence of intermolecular forces, including van der Waals forces and hydrogen bonding, on macroscopic properties like melting point and boiling point are briefly examined.  Overall, a thorough understanding of chemical bonding is crucial for interpreting and predicting the behaviour of chemical systems across diverse applications.  Future research should focus on integrating advanced computational methods with experimental data for more accurate and comprehensive modelling of complex molecular systems.
