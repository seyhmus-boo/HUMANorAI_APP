Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally governed by quantum mechanical principles.  The strong nuclear force, responsible for binding nucleons, operates within a short range, described by a potential well.  Within this well, nucleons occupy quantized energy levels, analogous to electrons in an atom.  However, unlike the relatively stable electron configurations, the nuclear energy levels are highly sensitive to the nucleon arrangement.  In heavy nuclei, the Coulomb repulsion between protons significantly outweighs the strong force's short-range attraction at the nuclear periphery. This leads to an unstable configuration where the wavefunction describing the nuclear state is susceptible to tunneling.  Neutron bombardment can introduce sufficient energy to overcome the potential barrier, initiating fission. The subsequent decay into smaller nuclei is determined by the probabilities associated with different decay channels, governed by quantum mechanical transition amplitudes.  The release of energy during fission is a direct consequence of the mass defect, a relativistic effect explained through Einstein's famous equation, E=mcÂ², where the mass difference manifests as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and released neutrons.
