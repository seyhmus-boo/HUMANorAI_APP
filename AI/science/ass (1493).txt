Black hole formation represents a crucial, yet still partially understood, process in astrophysics.  This presentation will explore the historical development of our understanding of black hole formation, beginning with the theoretical predictions of Karl Schwarzschild and the subsequent refinement of the concept by Oppenheimer and Snyder's seminal work on gravitational collapse.  We will review the key stellar evolutionary pathways leading to black hole birth, emphasizing the roles of stellar mass, metallicity, and binary interactions.  Different formation mechanisms will be contrasted, including the direct collapse of massive stars, the pair-instability supernova pathway for very massive stars, and the formation of black holes from the merger of neutron stars.

The presentation will further address current observational constraints on black hole formation, discussing the limitations of detecting progenitor stars and the challenges in distinguishing between different formation channels. We will touch upon recent advancements in numerical simulations, highlighting their crucial role in modelling the complex hydrodynamical and gravitational processes involved in stellar collapse and the subsequent black hole accretion. Finally, we will briefly outline promising avenues for future research, including the impact of improved observational facilities and refined theoretical models in resolving outstanding questions regarding black hole demographics and their contributions to galactic evolution.
