Black hole formation represents a critical endpoint in stellar evolution and a key component of galactic dynamics.  This summary examines the astrophysical processes leading to the creation of stellar-mass and supermassive black holes.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (>25 solar masses) at the end of their lifespan.  Core collapse, following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel, triggers a runaway implosion, overcoming neutron degeneracy pressure and forming a singularity.  The subsequent accretion of surrounding stellar material contributes to the black hole's mass and can lead to powerful supernova explosions.  The formation mechanism of supermassive black holes remains less certain, with leading hypotheses involving the direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe or the mergers and accretion of numerous stellar-mass black holes within galactic nuclei.  Active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent a key observational signature, powered by supermassive black holes accreting matter at prodigious rates.  Further investigation into the interplay of stellar feedback, galaxy mergers, and environmental conditions is crucial to fully elucidate the diverse pathways to black hole formation across cosmic time.
