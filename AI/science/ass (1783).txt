Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a source of ongoing research.  This presentation will provide a concise overview of entanglement, tracing its historical development from the early conceptualizations of Einstein, Podolsky, and Rosen (EPR) in their 1935 paradox, which questioned the completeness of quantum mechanics.  Their argument, highlighting the seemingly paradoxical nature of "spooky action at a distance," spurred decades of debate and experimental investigation.

The presentation will then explore the experimental verification of Bell's theorem, which provided a testable framework to distinguish between classical and quantum correlations.  Successful experiments demonstrating violations of Bell inequalities have definitively confirmed the existence of entanglement, showcasing its departure from classical intuition. Finally, the abstract will briefly touch upon the significant implications of entanglement for quantum information science, including its crucial role in quantum computing, cryptography, and teleportation.  We will conclude by considering future directions and open questions in this exciting and rapidly evolving field.
