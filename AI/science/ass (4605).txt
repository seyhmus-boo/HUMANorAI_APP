The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are deeply rooted in their quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp²-hybridized carbon atoms form a seamless cylindrical lattice, resulting in a delocalized π-electron system crucial for their electronic behavior.  Depending on chirality – the helical arrangement of the carbon atoms – CNTs can exhibit metallic or semiconducting properties.  This arises from the unique quantization of the electronic energy levels along the nanotube axis, governed by the tube's diameter and chiral angle. Metallic CNTs possess a linear band dispersion near the Fermi level, facilitating high electron mobility, while semiconducting CNTs display a band gap whose magnitude is inversely proportional to diameter.

Beyond electronic properties, the strong σ-bonds within the hexagonal lattice contribute to exceptional mechanical strength and stiffness.  Quantum mechanical calculations, employing techniques like density functional theory (DFT), are vital in predicting these mechanical properties and elucidating the role of van der Waals interactions between nanotubes in bundles.  Furthermore, the quantized vibrational modes, phonons, influence thermal conductivity, with ballistic phonon transport dominating at low temperatures, leading to remarkably high thermal conductivities exceeding those of diamond.  The intricate interplay of these quantum mechanical features underpins the diverse applications of CNTs in nanotechnology.
