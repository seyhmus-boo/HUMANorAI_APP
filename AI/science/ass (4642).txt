Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in stellar evolution, resulting from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  Analogous to a deflating balloon, a star's internal pressure, generated by nuclear fusion, counteracts its own immense gravity.  However, when fuel is exhausted in sufficiently massive stars (typically >25 solar masses), this outward pressure fails, initiating a runaway collapse. This process is akin to a domino effect, with each layer falling inward upon the layer beneath, ultimately overcoming even the degeneracy pressure of electrons and neutrons.  For stars exceeding a critical mass, this collapse proceeds unimpeded, resulting in a singularity â€“ a point of infinite density, analogous to infinitely compressing a sphere into a dimensionless point.  The surrounding spacetime becomes warped, creating an event horizon, a boundary beyond which even light cannot escape, much like a cosmic one-way street.  Alternative formation mechanisms, such as the collapse of supermassive star clusters, can produce supermassive black holes found at galactic centers, mirroring the cumulative effect of numerous smaller objects merging into a single, immensely powerful entity.  The study of black hole formation continues to refine our understanding of gravitational physics and the ultimate fate of stars.
