Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of spÂ²-bonded carbon atoms arranged in a hexagonal lattice.  Their exceptional mechanical strength arises from the strong covalent bonds and highly ordered structure, rendering them significantly stronger than steel on a weight basis.  High aspect ratios contribute to remarkable tensile strength and flexibility.

Electrically, CNTs can behave as either metallic or semiconducting materials, depending on their chirality (the helical arrangement of carbon atoms). This tunable conductivity makes them attractive for nanoelectronics.  Their high thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation.  Furthermore, CNTs possess a large surface area, leading to high adsorption capacity, useful in applications such as gas storage and catalysis.  These exceptional properties, combined with their tunability and nanoscale dimensions, underpin their potential in diverse fields ranging from materials science and electronics to medicine and energy storage.
