Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, remains a subject of intense investigation.  This presentation will review the established mechanisms of stellar-mass black hole formation through core-collapse supernovae, emphasizing recent advancements in numerical simulations that are increasingly accurately modeling the complex interplay of hydrodynamics, neutrino transport, and magnetic fields during this critical phase.  We will discuss the limitations of current models, particularly in accurately predicting the final black hole mass and spin, and highlight the emerging importance of progenitor star properties and binary interactions in shaping the resulting black hole population.  Furthermore, the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) remains a significant puzzle.  The presentation will briefly touch upon current hypotheses, including direct collapse scenarios and the role of mergers and accretion in their growth, considering the constraints imposed by observations from gravitational wave detectors and high-redshift quasar surveys.  Finally, we will discuss the ongoing efforts to improve our understanding through multi-messenger astronomy, combining data from gravitational waves, electromagnetic radiation, and neutrinos to gain a comprehensive view of black hole formation across cosmic time.
