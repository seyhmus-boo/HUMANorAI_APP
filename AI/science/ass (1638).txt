This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on recent advancements and ongoing research.  We will begin by reviewing the fundamental principles governing nuclear fission, including criticality and chain reactions, emphasizing the role of neutron interactions and isotopic considerations.  The presentation will then delve into the current landscape of fission reactor technology, highlighting the evolution from traditional light water reactors (LWRs) to advanced reactor designs such as Generation IV reactors.  These advanced designs incorporate innovative features aimed at improving safety, efficiency, and waste management, including passive safety systems and the potential for enhanced fuel utilization through closed fuel cycles.

Recent developments in the theoretical understanding of fission, particularly concerning the modeling of nuclear data and the prediction of fission fragment yields, will be discussed.  Furthermore, we will touch upon the increasing importance of Accelerator Driven Systems (ADS) and their potential applications in nuclear waste transmutation. Finally, the presentation will briefly address the societal and political implications of ongoing nuclear fission research, considering both the promise of clean energy and the persistent challenges associated with nuclear waste disposal and proliferation concerns.
