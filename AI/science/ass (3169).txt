Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  This correlation transcends classical physics, where systems are independent unless explicitly interacting. Entangled systems exhibit a shared fate, irrespective of spatial separation.  Their combined quantum state cannot be factored into individual states of the constituent systems;  instead, they are described by a single, entangled wavefunction.

Measurements performed on one entangled particle instantaneously influence the state of the others, regardless of distance, a phenomenon seemingly violating local realism. This apparent non-locality, however, does not allow for faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of the measurement on each individual particle remains probabilistic until measured.  The correlations, quantified by Bell inequalities, demonstrably violate classical predictions, confirming the existence of entanglement and highlighting the fundamental non-classical nature of quantum mechanics.  Entanglement finds applications in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation, leveraging its unique properties for information processing and communication.  Further research continues to explore the deeper implications of entanglement and its role in fundamental physics.
