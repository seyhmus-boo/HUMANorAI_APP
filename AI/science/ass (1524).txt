CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in genome editing.  However, despite its widespread adoption, several experimental challenges remain that hinder its broader application. This presentation will focus on key limitations currently impacting CRISPR technology. We will discuss off-target effects, a significant concern arising from the potential for unintended genomic modifications at sites similar to the target sequence.  Strategies for minimizing off-target activity, including improved guide RNA design and the development of high-fidelity Cas nucleases, will be examined.  Furthermore, the presentation will address challenges associated with efficient delivery of CRISPR components into target cells and tissues, particularly in vivo applications.  The complexities of delivery methods, including viral vectors and non-viral approaches, will be discussed, highlighting their limitations and potential improvements.  Finally, the inherent difficulties in accurately assessing editing outcomes, including the detection of both intended and unintended modifications, will be reviewed, emphasizing the need for robust and sensitive analytical techniques. Overcoming these challenges is crucial for the successful translation of CRISPR technology into clinical and agricultural settings.
