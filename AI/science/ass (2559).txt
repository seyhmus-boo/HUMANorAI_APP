Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  Early theoretical work, stemming from John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace's 18th-century conjectures on "dark stars," laid the groundwork for understanding objects whose gravity prevents even light from escaping.  Einstein's theory of General Relativity, however, provided the rigorous framework for describing black holes as singularities in spacetime.

The process begins with a massive star (typically >20 solar masses) nearing the end of its nuclear fusion lifecycle.  As fusion ceases, the star's internal pressure can no longer withstand its immense gravity.  Subsequent collapse leads to a core exceeding the Tolman–Oppenheimer–Volkoff limit, the maximum mass for a stable neutron star.  This triggers runaway gravitational collapse, compressing the core to an infinitesimally small volume, forming a singularity.  Surrounding material accretes onto the singularity, forming an event horizon – the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  This accretion process often manifests as luminous quasars or active galactic nuclei, providing observational evidence for black hole formation and evolution.  Different progenitor star masses and rotation rates influence the black hole's final characteristics, resulting in a diverse population of stellar-mass and supermassive black holes found throughout the universe.
