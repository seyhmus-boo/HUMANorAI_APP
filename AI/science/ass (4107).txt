DNA replication, the precise duplication of the genome, is a fundamental process underpinning life's continuity.  This intricate mechanism, while classically understood through the semi-conservative model, continues to yield fascinating insights with advancements in molecular biology and imaging techniques.  This paper will explore the current understanding of DNA replication, focusing on recent developments that refine our knowledge of this crucial cellular process.

Traditional models emphasized the roles of key enzymes like DNA polymerase and helicase, but recent research has highlighted the complexity of the replisome, revealing a dynamic interplay between numerous accessory proteins and regulatory factors.  Advancements in single-molecule techniques, such as magnetic tweezers and atomic force microscopy, have provided unprecedented resolution into the mechanics of replication fork progression, revealing fluctuations and pauses that were previously unobservable.  Furthermore, the role of epigenetic modifications in regulating replication timing and fidelity is increasingly appreciated, connecting genomic stability to broader cellular processes.  Finally, the identification of novel mechanisms for resolving replication stress and preventing genomic instability, particularly in challenging genomic contexts such as highly repetitive sequences, represents a significant area of ongoing investigation.  This review will synthesize these recent findings, emphasizing their contributions to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of DNA replication and its implications for genome stability and disease.
