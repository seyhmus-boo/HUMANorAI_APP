Chemical bonding and molecular structure underpin all of chemistry.  Traditional theories, like Valence Bond Theory (VBT) and Molecular Orbital Theory (MOT), explain bonding through electron sharing or delocalization, respectively, predicting molecular geometry and properties.  However, limitations exist; VBT struggles with delocalized systems, while MOT's computational demands increase exponentially with molecular size.

Recent developments focus on bridging these gaps and addressing complex systems.  Density Functional Theory (DFT), a computationally efficient quantum mechanical method, provides a powerful alternative, calculating electron density distributions to predict structure and reactivity.  Advances in machine learning are further refining DFT calculations and enabling predictions for increasingly larger molecules.  Furthermore, research into weak intermolecular forces, crucial for supramolecular chemistry and biological systems, is enhanced by advanced spectroscopic techniques, like terahertz spectroscopy, providing insights into dynamic interactions. These developments are not only improving our understanding of known molecules but also facilitating the design and prediction of novel materials with tailored properties.
