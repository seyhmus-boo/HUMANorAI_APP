Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, prompting significant research into their potential applications in diverse fields ranging from nanoelectronics to composite materials.  However, despite decades of research, realizing the full potential of CNTs remains hampered by significant experimental challenges.  This paper focuses on these critical limitations, examining the difficulties inherent in achieving high purity, controlled diameter and length distributions, and precise structural characterization.  The inherent propensity for CNT aggregation, due to strong van der Waals forces, presents a significant hurdle in processing and manipulating individual tubes, impacting both material characterization and device fabrication.  Furthermore, the accurate determination of structural parameters, such as chirality and defect density, remains a significant technical challenge, limiting our understanding of the structure-property relationships crucial for optimizing CNT performance.  We will explore various experimental techniques employed to address these challenges, highlighting their limitations and suggesting avenues for future advancements in the controlled synthesis, characterization, and manipulation of CNTs.
