Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), possessing exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for diverse applications.  However, realizing this potential is hampered by significant experimental challenges.  Precise control over CNT synthesis remains a major hurdle, with methods frequently yielding heterogeneous mixtures of diameters, chiralities, and lengths, hindering reproducibility and impacting material performance.  Characterizing the intricate structure and properties of individual CNTs also presents difficulties.  Advanced microscopy techniques, while providing valuable insights, often struggle with resolving subtle structural variations, particularly chirality, crucial for understanding electronic properties.  Furthermore, manipulating and assembling CNTs into macroscopic structures for practical applications proves challenging due to their strong van der Waals interactions and tendency for bundling.  The inherent difficulty in separating metallic and semiconducting CNTs adds another layer of complexity, particularly for electronic applications requiring specific conductivity.  Addressing these experimental limitations through improved synthesis strategies, advanced characterization techniques, and refined assembly methods is paramount for unlocking the full potential of CNTs.
