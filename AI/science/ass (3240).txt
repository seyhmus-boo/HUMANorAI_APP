Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of spatial separation.  This interconnectedness transcends classical correlations; measurement of a property on one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the other, even across vast distances.  This non-local correlation does not violate causality, as no information can be transmitted faster than light.  

The entangled state is described mathematically by a superposition of product states, incapable of being factored into individual states of the constituent particles.  The Bell inequalities, experimentally violated numerous times, demonstrate the incompatibility of entanglement with local realismâ€”the notion that systems possess pre-existing properties and that influences are limited by locality.  Entanglement arises from the tensor product structure of composite quantum systems and the inherent superposition principle.  Its exploitation is crucial in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation, where entangled particles serve as a resource for enhanced computation and secure communication.  The precise nature of the correlations and their implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics remain active areas of research.
