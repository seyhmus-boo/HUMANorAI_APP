Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, have captivated scientific interest due to their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, promising revolutionary applications in diverse fields.  However, a complete understanding of these properties requires delving beyond classical mechanics and into the realm of quantum mechanics.  This paper investigates the fundamental quantum mechanical principles governing the unique characteristics of CNTs.  We focus on the crucial role of Ï€-electron delocalization within the sp<sup>2</sup> hybridized carbon network, analyzing its impact on electronic band structure and consequently, electrical conductivity.  The strong covalent bonding and unique geometrical structure, derived from the rolling of a graphene sheet, will be explored within the framework of density functional theory (DFT) and tight-binding approximations to elucidate their influence on mechanical strength and thermal transport.  Furthermore, we address the effects of nanotube diameter, chirality, and defects on their electronic and mechanical properties, highlighting the quantum mechanical origins of these variations.  Ultimately, this research aims to provide a comprehensive quantum mechanical perspective on the structure-property relationships in CNTs, paving the way for the rational design and synthesis of materials with tailored functionalities.
