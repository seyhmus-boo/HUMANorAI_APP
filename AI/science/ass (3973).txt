Quantum entanglement, a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate regardless of the spatial separation, remains a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and a crucial resource for emerging quantum technologies. This presentation provides a concise overview of entanglement, exploring its fundamental principles and key characteristics.  We will examine the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox and Bell's theorem, highlighting their significance in establishing the non-classical nature of entanglement.  The presentation will then delve into different types of entanglement, such as Bell states and GHZ states, discussing their properties and applications.  Furthermore, we will briefly address the challenges associated with generating, manipulating, and preserving entanglement, particularly concerning decoherence and environmental noise.  Finally, the presentation will touch upon the rapidly advancing field of quantum information science, emphasizing the crucial role of entanglement in quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  The aim is to provide a foundational understanding of this intriguing phenomenon and its implications for future technological advancements.
