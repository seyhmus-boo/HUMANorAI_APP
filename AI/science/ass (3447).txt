Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more particles become linked in such a way that they share the same fate, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This interconnectedness transcends classical physics; measuring the property of one entangled particle instantaneously determines the corresponding property of the other, even across vast distances, seemingly violating the principle of locality.  This correlation arises from the particles' shared quantum state, described by a single wave function, rather than individual states.

While the foundational implications are profound, challenging our understanding of reality and information transfer,  entanglement also possesses significant practical applications.  Quantum computing leverages entanglement to perform computations beyond the capabilities of classical computers, employing entangled qubits to achieve exponential speedups in certain algorithms.  Quantum cryptography utilizes entangled photons to create unconditionally secure communication channels, exploiting the violation of Bell's inequalities to detect eavesdropping.  Further applications are being explored in quantum sensing and metrology, where entangled states enhance measurement precision, and quantum teleportation, where quantum information is transferred across space using entangled particles.  However, maintaining entanglement and scaling these technologies remain significant challenges.
