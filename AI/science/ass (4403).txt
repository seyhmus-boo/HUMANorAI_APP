Good morning. Today's lecture concerns black hole formation, a fascinating culmination of stellar evolution.  Imagine a massive star, perhaps ten times the Sun's mass, as a colossal pressure cooker.  Nuclear fusion, the star's energy source, combats the inward pull of gravity.  However, when the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, this pressure dissipates.  Gravity, the relentless chef, takes over.

The core collapses catastrophically.  Picture a deflating balloon: the star's outer layers, no longer supported, implode inwards, creating an unimaginably dense object.  If the core's mass exceeds a critical threshold – roughly three times the Sun's –  even the immense pressure of degenerate matter, akin to densely packed marbles, cannot withstand gravity's crushing force. The collapse continues unabated, resulting in a singularity, a point of infinite density, shrouded by an event horizon: a point of no return, like a cosmic drain whose pull nothing, not even light, can escape.  This, in essence, is the birth of a black hole.  Further research focuses on the nuances of this process, exploring variations influenced by stellar rotation and magnetic fields.
