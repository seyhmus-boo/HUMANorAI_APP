Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery with profound implications.  Initially a theoretical concept explored by scientists like Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch in the late 1930s, building upon the work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann who observed the phenomenon experimentally, its potential for energy generation was quickly realized.  The process involves the bombardment of a fissile nucleus, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with neutrons, leading to an unstable, excited state that subsequently fragments.  This fragmentation releases a significant amount of energy, primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  Crucially, the released neutrons can trigger further fission events in a chain reaction, sustaining the process and generating substantial power.

This chain reaction, however, requires careful control, achieved through moderators which slow down the neutrons to increase the probability of fission, and control rods which absorb neutrons to regulate the reaction rate.  Understanding and controlling the chain reaction forms the basis of both nuclear power generation and nuclear weaponry. The historical development of fission, marked by both scientific breakthroughs and ethical dilemmas, continues to shape global energy policies and security concerns.
