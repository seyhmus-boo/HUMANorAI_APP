Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized structure.  Their remarkable tensile strength, high Young's modulus, and low density make them attractive for advanced composites and structural materials.  Electrical properties vary significantly depending on chirality and diameter, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, enabling applications in electronics and sensors.  Recent advancements focus on controlled synthesis techniques, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and laser ablation, which allow for precise control over CNT diameter, length, and chirality, thus improving material performance and reproducibility.  Furthermore, significant progress has been made in scalable production methods and functionalization strategies to enhance dispersion and compatibility with polymer matrices.  Emerging research investigates the use of CNTs in energy storage (batteries, supercapacitors), biomedical applications (drug delivery, biosensors), and flexible electronics.  However, challenges remain concerning the long-term toxicity and scalability of high-quality CNT production for widespread commercialization.  Future studies should prioritize addressing these issues to fully exploit the potential of CNTs across diverse technological domains.
