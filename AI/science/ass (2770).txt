This presentation provides a concise overview of DNA replication, a fundamental process crucial for cellular proliferation and heredity. We will explore the intricate molecular mechanisms underpinning this process, focusing on the key enzymes involved, including DNA polymerases, helicases, and primases, and their coordinated actions in initiating, elongating, and proofreading newly synthesized DNA strands.  The challenges posed by replication at the lagging strand, including Okazaki fragment generation and ligation, will be highlighted.  Furthermore, we will discuss the importance of accurate replication in maintaining genomic stability and preventing mutations that can contribute to disease development.  The presentation will briefly explore the practical applications stemming from our understanding of DNA replication.  These applications include advancements in molecular biology techniques like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), crucial for diagnostics and research, and the development of novel anticancer therapies targeting specific replication enzymes in rapidly proliferating cancer cells.  Finally, we will touch upon the future directions of research in this field, including the exploration of novel replication mechanisms in extremophiles and their potential biotechnological applications.
