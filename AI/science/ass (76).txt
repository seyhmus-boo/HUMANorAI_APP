Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the remarkable properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional characteristics stemming from their unique cylindrical nanostructure.  These properties stem from the strong sp² hybridized carbon bonds forming the hexagonal lattice.  CNTs exhibit exceptional tensile strength, exceeding that of steel by a significant margin, coupled with remarkable flexibility and elasticity.  Their high aspect ratio contributes to an extraordinarily high surface area, leading to enhanced adsorption capabilities.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality – the arrangement of carbon atoms in the lattice. This tunable conductivity is crucial.

These remarkable properties translate into diverse applications.  Their strength is exploited in composite materials for aerospace and automotive industries.  Their high surface area facilitates applications in energy storage, such as supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries. Their electrical conductivity underpins their use in advanced electronics, including transistors and flexible displays.  The ongoing research into CNTs promises even wider applications in areas such as drug delivery and biosensors, showcasing their versatility in diverse technological domains.
