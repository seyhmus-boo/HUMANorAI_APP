Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, remains shrouded in significant observational challenges. While theoretical models robustly predict their genesis from stellar collapse and galactic mergers, directly observing these processes remains elusive. This presentation will explore the key experimental hurdles in verifying these theoretical frameworks.  The transient and extreme nature of black hole formation, involving gravitational collapse across vast dynamic ranges of spacetime, poses considerable difficulties for current instrumentation.  Gravitational wave astronomy, while offering a promising avenue, suffers from limitations in source localization and the need for improved sensitivity to detect the faint signals from lower-mass black hole mergers. Electromagnetic counterparts, while offering complementary information, are often obscured by dust and gas, hindering detailed spectroscopic analysis crucial for constraining progenitor properties. Furthermore, disentangling the electromagnetic signatures of black hole formation from those of other energetic astrophysical events represents a substantial analytical challenge. This presentation will critically assess these experimental limitations, outlining future advancements in instrumentation and analysis techniques required to further our understanding of black hole formation and thereby refine theoretical models of stellar evolution and galactic dynamics.
