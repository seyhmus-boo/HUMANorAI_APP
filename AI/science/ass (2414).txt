DNA replication is the semiconservative process by which a cell duplicates its genome prior to cell division.  The double-stranded DNA molecule unwinds, facilitated by enzymes like helicases, exposing the nucleotide bases.  Each strand then serves as a template for the synthesis of a new complementary strand.  DNA polymerases catalyze the addition of nucleotides, ensuring fidelity through base pairing (A with T, and G with C).  Leading and lagging strands are synthesized differently due to the antiparallel nature of DNA.  The lagging strand requires the synthesis of Okazaki fragments, joined later by ligase.  This intricate process, governed by a complex interplay of enzymes and proteins, guarantees accurate duplication of genetic information.  Errors are minimized through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerases.

Practical applications of understanding DNA replication are vast.  In medicine, understanding replication fidelity is crucial for comprehending mutagenesis and cancer development.  Molecular biology techniques like Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) directly exploit the principles of DNA replication for amplification of specific DNA sequences, crucial for diagnostics and research.  Furthermore, insights into replication mechanisms inform the development of antiviral and anticancer drugs targeting essential replication enzymes.
