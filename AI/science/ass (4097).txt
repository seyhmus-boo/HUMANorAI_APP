Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the experimental challenges inherent in studying DNA replication.  While the semi-conservative model is well-established, its elucidation wasn't straightforward.  Early experiments faced significant hurdles.  Visualizing the process directly at the molecular level presented a major obstacle, requiring the development of sophisticated techniques like electron microscopy and fluorescence microscopy to observe replication forks and associated proteins.  Furthermore, the sheer complexity of the replication machinery, with its numerous enzymes and accessory factors, posed a significant challenge to dissecting individual contributions.  Isotopic labelling experiments, while crucial in establishing the semi-conservative mechanism, were limited in their resolution.  The in vivo environment, with its inherent dynamism and complex regulatory networks, further complicates the study, making in vitro systems crucial but potentially lacking in physiological relevance.  Ultimately, overcoming these obstacles necessitates a multi-faceted approach, integrating diverse methodologies to achieve a comprehensive understanding of this fundamental biological process.
