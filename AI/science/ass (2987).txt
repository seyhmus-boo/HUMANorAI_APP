Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems exhibit correlated behaviour regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This correlation transcends classical physics;  the measurement outcome of one entangled particle instantaneously influences the state of the other, even across vast distances. This non-local correlation arises from the superposition principle and the inherent probabilistic nature of quantum states.  Entangled particles are described by a joint wavefunction that cannot be factored into individual wavefunctions, indicating a holistic system rather than independent constituents.

Bell's theorem and subsequent experimental violations decisively demonstrate the incompatibility of entanglement with local realism, a cornerstone of classical physics.  The violation arises from the inherent non-locality of quantum mechanics, challenging our intuitive understanding of causality and space-time.  Entanglement's practical implications are far-reaching, underpinning technologies like quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation.  However, the fundamental interpretation and conceptual understanding of entanglement remain subjects of ongoing debate, particularly concerning the nature of quantum measurement and the role of information.
