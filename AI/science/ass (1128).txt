Good morning. Today's lecture concerns chemical bonding and molecular structure, foundational concepts in chemistry.  Early attempts to understand matter, such as Dalton's atomic theory, laid the groundwork, but lacked an explanation for the forces holding atoms together.  The development of quantum mechanics revolutionized this field, providing the theoretical basis for understanding chemical bonds.

We will examine the primary bonding types: ionic bonds, resulting from electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions, typically formed between metals and nonmetals; covalent bonds, arising from the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, prevalent in nonmetal-nonmetal interactions; and metallic bonds, characterized by delocalized electrons within a lattice of metal cations.

Molecular structure, the three-dimensional arrangement of atoms, is intrinsically linked to bonding.  The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory provides a predictive model for molecular geometries based on minimizing electron pair repulsions.  Understanding both bonding and structure is crucial to predicting a molecule's physical and chemical properties, impacting fields from materials science to biochemistry.  This will be explored further in subsequent lectures.
