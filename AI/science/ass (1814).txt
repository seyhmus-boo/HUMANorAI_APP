Black hole formation remains a vibrant area of astrophysical research, bridging theoretical predictions with observational constraints. This presentation will review the principal pathways to black hole genesis: stellar collapse and galactic mergers.  Recent advancements in numerical relativity have significantly improved our understanding of stellar-mass black hole formation, particularly regarding the role of progenitor star rotation and magnetic fields in determining the final black hole properties, including spin and mass.  We will discuss the implications of these simulations for gravitational wave observations from binary black hole mergers, emphasizing how they inform our models of the underlying progenitor systems.

Furthermore, the advent of high-resolution X-ray and radio observations offers new insights into the formation of supermassive black holes (SMBHs), challenging traditional models of seed black hole growth.  We will explore the evidence for direct collapse black holes and the role of rapid accretion in the early Universe, highlighting recent observations that support both scenarios.  Finally, the presentation will touch upon ongoing challenges, including the precise mechanism for SMBH seeding and the connection between SMBH growth and galaxy evolution, emphasizing areas where future research is most urgently needed.
