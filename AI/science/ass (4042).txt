The formation of black holes, a cornerstone of astrophysics, necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon general relativity, nuclear physics, and computational astrophysics.  Stellar-mass black holes arise from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (≥20 solar masses) at the end of their life cycle.  Nuclear fusion in the stellar core ceases, leading to core collapse and the subsequent rebound of infalling matter, resulting in a supernova explosion.  If the remnant exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, no known force can counteract gravity, and a singularity forms, shrouded by an event horizon – a black hole.

Understanding this process demands intricate numerical simulations which leverage computational astrophysics to model the complex interplay of gravity, hydrodynamics, and neutrino transport within the collapsing star.  Furthermore, the properties of ultra-dense nuclear matter at the core necessitate input from nuclear physics models to accurately predict the equation of state governing the collapse. Therefore, advancements in each of these fields are crucial for refining our understanding of black hole formation, revealing insights into the universe's most extreme environments.
