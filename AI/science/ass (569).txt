Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a non-classical correlation between two or more quantum systems.  Unlike classical correlations, which can be explained by shared properties, entangled systems exhibit correlations that transcend any local realistic description.  This is formalized mathematically by Bell's theorem, which demonstrates the incompatibility of quantum mechanics with local hidden variable theories attempting to explain entanglement through pre-existing properties.

Entanglement arises from the superposition principle, where a composite system exists in a superposition of entangled states, incapable of being factored into separate states of its constituent subsystems.  Measurement of one entangled particle instantaneously collapses the wavefunction, determining the state of the other, regardless of spatial separation.  This non-local correlation, while not allowing for faster-than-light communication (according to the no-communication theorem), challenges our intuitive understanding of locality and causality.  The degree of entanglement is quantified by measures such as entanglement entropy, reflecting the degree of correlation and the amount of information shared between the entangled systems.  Active research continues to explore the exploitation of entanglement for applications in quantum computing and quantum communication protocols.
