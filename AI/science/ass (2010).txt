Quantum entanglement, a counterintuitive phenomenon, describes a correlation between two or more quantum systems that persists even when spatially separated.  This correlation surpasses classical correlations, defying the principle of local realism.  Imagine two coins, magically linked: if one lands heads, the other *always* lands tails, regardless of the distance separating them.  This is analogous to entangled particles, where the measurement of one instantaneously determines the state of the other, irrespective of the spatial separation.  However, unlike the coins, the entangled particles' individual states are indeterminate before measurement; they exist in a superposition of possibilities.  The "magic" arises from the shared quantum state, a holistic entity exceeding the description of individual particles.  This entanglement is not merely a correlation of information; it represents a fundamental interconnectedness at the quantum level.  Experimental verification of Bell's inequalities consistently demonstrates the violation of local realism, solidifying entanglement's non-classical nature.  Ongoing research explores potential applications in quantum computing and cryptography, leveraging this fundamental interconnectedness for enhanced computational power and secure communication.
