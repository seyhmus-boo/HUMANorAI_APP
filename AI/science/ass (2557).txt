CRISPR-Cas systems have revolutionized genetic engineering, offering unprecedented precision and efficiency in genome editing. This presentation will review recent advancements in CRISPR technology, focusing on its expanding applications beyond simple gene knockouts and knock-ins.  We will discuss the development of base editors, which enable precise point mutations without creating double-stranded breaks, significantly reducing off-target effects.  Furthermore, prime editors, capable of performing more complex edits including insertions and deletions at targeted sites, represent a significant leap forward.  The presentation will also explore progress in delivery systems, highlighting advancements in viral and non-viral vectors for efficient and targeted gene editing *in vivo*.  Finally, we will address the ethical considerations surrounding CRISPR technologies, focusing on the responsible development and deployment of this powerful tool in areas such as gene therapy, agricultural biotechnology, and synthetic biology.  Recent debates surrounding germline editing will also be briefly discussed, emphasizing the ongoing need for robust regulatory frameworks.
