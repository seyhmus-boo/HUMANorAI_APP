Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, hold immense promise for diverse technological applications.  However, the full realization of this potential is significantly hampered by persistent experimental challenges.  This research paper examines the key experimental limitations encountered in the characterization and manipulation of CNTs, hindering a complete understanding of their properties and hindering reproducible large-scale applications.  Specific difficulties include the inherent heterogeneity of CNT samples, encompassing variations in diameter, length, chirality, and structural defects, which confound accurate property measurements and necessitate sophisticated separation techniques.  Furthermore, the strong van der Waals interactions between individual nanotubes lead to bundling, complicating dispersion in solvents and matrices crucial for device fabrication.  The precise control over CNT growth and placement remains a significant challenge, especially for large-scale, high-density arrays essential for many applications.  Finally, the development of reliable and scalable methods for non-destructive characterization, particularly at the individual nanotube level, remains a crucial unmet need.  This paper will critically assess these experimental hurdles and discuss emerging strategies aimed at overcoming them.
