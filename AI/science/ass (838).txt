Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, possess exceptional properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms.  Their remarkable strength-to-weight ratio, exceeding that of steel, is a key characteristic, alongside high tensile strength and elastic modulus.  This structural integrity arises from the strong covalent bonds within the graphene sheets forming the nanotube walls.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting materials depending on their chirality (the arrangement of carbon atoms in the hexagonal lattice). This tunable conductivity has significant implications for electronics applications.  Their high thermal conductivity also contributes to their utility in thermal management systems.  

However, challenges remain.  Precise control over nanotube chirality and diameter during synthesis is crucial for consistent material properties.  Furthermore, the tendency for CNTs to agglomerate due to van der Waals forces necessitates effective dispersion techniques for practical applications.  Despite these challenges, the remarkable properties of CNTs continue to drive extensive research and development across diverse fields, including materials science, electronics, and medicine.
