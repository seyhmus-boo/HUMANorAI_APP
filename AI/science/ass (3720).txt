Catalysts in organic chemistry profoundly influence reaction rates by lowering the activation energy via quantum mechanical interactions.  Their efficacy stems from the modification of the potential energy surface governing the reaction pathway.  A catalyst's active site, possessing specific electronic and steric properties, interacts with reactants, forming a catalyst-reactant complex.  This interaction involves orbital overlap and electron redistribution, leading to a stabilization of the transition state.  Quantum mechanically, this is reflected in a decrease in the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the reactants or an increase in the energy of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), facilitating electron transfer and bond formation/cleavage.  The catalyst, participating in multiple elementary steps, ultimately regenerates itself, leaving the overall thermodynamics unchanged but dramatically increasing the reaction kinetics.  Transition state theory, employing quantum mechanical calculations, allows for quantitative prediction of catalytic activity based on the energy difference between the reactants and the transition state, which the catalyst effectively reduces.
