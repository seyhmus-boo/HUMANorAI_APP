The understanding of chemical bonding and molecular structure has evolved significantly since Dalton's atomic theory.  Early models, such as Kekul√©'s benzene structure, laid the groundwork, albeit with limitations in explaining bonding mechanisms. The advent of quantum mechanics revolutionized the field, providing a robust theoretical framework.  The valence bond (VB) theory, emphasizing orbital overlap and covalent bonds, and molecular orbital (MO) theory, describing delocalized electrons in molecular orbitals, offer complementary perspectives.  VB theory effectively explains localized bonds and molecular geometry through hybridization, while MO theory accounts for phenomena like resonance and aromaticity, particularly crucial for understanding conjugated systems.  

The crucial concept of electronegativity dictates bond polarity and the formation of ionic bonds, contrasting with the electron sharing characteristic of covalent bonds.  Furthermore, intermolecular forces, including hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and dipole-dipole interactions, significantly influence macroscopic properties like boiling point and solubility.  Modern techniques like X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy provide crucial experimental validation of predicted structures and bonding types, continuously refining our understanding of this fundamental aspect of chemistry.
