Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on CRISPR-Cas systems, revolutionary tools in genetic engineering.  CRISPR, derived from bacterial immune systems, utilizes guide RNA to target specific DNA sequences, enabling precise gene editing through the Cas enzyme.  Its simplicity and efficiency have propelled it to the forefront of biomedical research.

Recent developments showcase CRISPR's expanding capabilities.  Base editing, a refinement of CRISPR, allows for single nucleotide changes without causing double-stranded DNA breaks, minimizing off-target effects.  Prime editing, a further advancement, offers even greater precision, enabling all 12 types of point mutations and small insertions/deletions.  Beyond gene editing, CRISPR is being explored in gene regulation, enabling the activation or repression of genes without altering the DNA sequence.

Furthermore,  delivery methods are continuously being improved, with advancements in viral and non-viral vector systems enhancing efficiency and targeting specificity.  These advancements are paving the way for novel therapeutic applications, including gene therapy for genetic disorders and cancer immunotherapy, highlighting CRISPR's transformative potential in biomedicine.
