Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, necessitates an interdisciplinary approach drawing upon general relativity, nuclear physics, and computational astrophysics.  The process fundamentally hinges on the gravitational collapse of a stellar remnant.  When a massive star (typically exceeding 20 solar masses) exhausts its nuclear fuel, it can no longer withstand its own immense gravitational pull.  Nuclear physics provides crucial input by defining the stellar evolutionary pathways and the resulting composition of the core, determining the final mass and stability of the remnant. General relativity then dictates the subsequent dynamics, with the core's density surpassing the critical Schwarzschild radius, leading to the formation of a singularity and an event horizon â€“ the defining characteristics of a black hole.  However, the detailed processes involved, such as the interplay of hydrodynamic instabilities during collapse and the subsequent accretion of surrounding matter, require sophisticated computational astrophysics models. These models integrate numerical relativity with radiative transfer calculations, allowing for a more complete understanding of the observed properties of black holes, including their mass, spin, and jets.  The interdisciplinary nature of this research highlights the interconnectedness of physics subfields in addressing complex astrophysical phenomena.
