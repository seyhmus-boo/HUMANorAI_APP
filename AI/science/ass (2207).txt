DNA replication, the process by which a cell duplicates its genome, is fundamental to life.  Early understanding, stemming from the Avery-MacLeod-McCarty experiment (1944) which identified DNA as the hereditary material, paved the way for the elucidation of its mechanism.  The seminal work of Meselson and Stahl (1958) definitively demonstrated semi-conservative replication, where each daughter strand comprises one parental and one newly synthesized strand. This model is predicated on the unwinding of the double helix, facilitated by helicases, and the subsequent synthesis of new strands by DNA polymerases, which require a primer for initiation.  Leading and lagging strand synthesis occur concurrently, with the lagging strand synthesized discontinuously in Okazaki fragments.  The high fidelity of replication is ensured by proofreading mechanisms intrinsic to DNA polymerases, alongside post-replicative repair pathways.  Telomeres and telomerase address the challenge of replicating the lagging strand ends, mitigating against chromosome shortening.  Dysregulation of these intricate processes contributes significantly to genomic instability and disease, underscoring the crucial role of accurate DNA replication in maintaining cellular integrity and organismal health.
