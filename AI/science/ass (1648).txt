Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991, are cylindrical allotropes of carbon exhibiting exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties.  Their structure, consisting of seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets, results in a high aspect ratio and remarkable strength, with tensile strengths exceeding that of steel.  The diameter and chirality of the nanotubes significantly influence their properties.  Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) can exhibit metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chiral angle, a feature crucial for nanoelectronic applications. Multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), composed of concentrically nested SWCNTs, generally exhibit higher mechanical strength but lower electrical conductivity.  Their high thermal conductivity makes them suitable for heat dissipation applications.  However, challenges remain, including controlled synthesis of specific CNT types, efficient dispersion and functionalization for improved processability, and addressing potential toxicity concerns.  Ongoing research focuses on overcoming these hurdles to fully exploit the potential of CNTs across diverse fields, including composites, electronics, energy storage, and biomedical engineering.
