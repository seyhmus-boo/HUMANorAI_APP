Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, comprises two principal stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts, where chlorophyll absorbs photons, exciting electrons to a higher energy level.  This initiates an electron transport chain, generating ATP and NADPH, energy-carrying molecules.  Water is split (photolysis), releasing oxygen as a byproduct.

The light-independent reactions, occurring in the stroma, utilize ATP and NADPH to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into organic molecules, primarily glucose, via a series of enzymatic reactions.  This carbon fixation is catalyzed by the enzyme RuBisCO.

Understanding these mechanisms has yielded numerous practical applications.  Biofuel production aims to harness photosynthetic efficiency to generate renewable energy sources from plants.  Agricultural advancements leverage knowledge of photosynthesis to improve crop yields through genetic engineering and optimized growing conditions.  Furthermore, research into artificial photosynthesis seeks to develop sustainable methods for producing fuels and chemicals, mimicking natural processes to address energy demands.
