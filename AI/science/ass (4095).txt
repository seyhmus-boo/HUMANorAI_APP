Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered in 1991 by Iijima, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials exhibiting exceptional properties stemming from their unique cylindrical structure composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms.  Their exceptional mechanical strength, with tensile strengths exceeding that of steel, is a key characteristic, attributed to the strong covalent bonds within their graphitic lattice.  Furthermore, CNTs possess remarkable electrical conductivity, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behavior depending on their chirality and diameter, making them promising for applications in electronics.  Their high aspect ratio facilitates exceptionally high surface area, crucial for applications like gas storage and catalysis.

However, the practical utilization of CNTs is challenged by several factors.  Challenges include controlling their chirality and diameter during synthesis to achieve desired properties, as well as effectively dispersing them in various matrices due to their strong van der Waals interactions.  Furthermore, the potential toxicity of CNTs remains a subject of ongoing research. Despite these hurdles, the exceptional properties of CNTs continue to drive intense research and development efforts, aiming to leverage their unique attributes across diverse fields, from advanced composites to energy storage and biomedical applications.
