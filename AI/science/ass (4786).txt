Black hole formation remains a central topic in astrophysics, encompassing a rich interplay of stellar evolution, gravitational collapse, and general relativity. This presentation reviews the primary pathways leading to black hole genesis, focusing on the contrasting mechanisms of stellar-mass and supermassive black hole formation.  We will examine the end stages of massive star evolution, highlighting the crucial role of core-collapse supernovae in producing stellar-mass black holes.  The diverse observational signatures of these events, including gravitational waves and electromagnetic counterparts, will be discussed, emphasizing their importance in constraining theoretical models.  The formation of supermassive black holes, however, remains a more enigmatic process. We will explore competing scenarios, such as direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe and the growth of seed black holes through accretion and mergers.  The presentation will conclude by addressing ongoing research challenges, including the precise mass distribution of stellar-mass black holes, the origin of the first black holes, and the feedback mechanisms influencing galactic evolution driven by active galactic nuclei powered by supermassive black holes.  This work emphasizes the significant advancements and persistent mysteries within the field, highlighting the importance of multi-messenger observations for future progress.
