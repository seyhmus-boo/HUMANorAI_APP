Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysical research, arises from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  This process, initiated when stellar nuclear fusion ceases, is driven by the overwhelming inward pull of gravity overcoming the outward pressure generated by degenerate electron and neutron pressures.  For stars exceeding approximately three times the mass of our Sun, even neutron degeneracy pressure is insufficient to withstand gravitational forces.  The core subsequently collapses catastrophically, forming a singularity – a region of infinite density – at the center.  The surrounding material, unable to escape the immense gravitational field, accretes onto this singularity, creating the event horizon that defines the black hole's boundary.  While stellar-mass black holes originate from this stellar collapse, supermassive black holes, found at galactic centers, necessitate alternative formation mechanisms, possibly involving direct collapse of gas clouds or the merger of smaller black holes, which remain subjects of ongoing investigation.  The study of black hole formation is crucial for understanding galactic evolution and the dynamics of the universe at large.
