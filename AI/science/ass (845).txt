The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) drive their interdisciplinary application across materials science, electronics, and biomedical engineering.  Their unique structure, comprising seamlessly rolled-up graphene sheets, bestows exceptional mechanical strength, with tensile strength exceeding that of steel by several orders of magnitude. This high strength, coupled with remarkable flexibility and low density, makes them attractive for lightweight composite materials in aerospace and automotive industries.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit exceptional electrical conductivity, behaving as either metallic or semiconducting depending on their chirality â€“ the angle and direction of the graphene sheet roll-up. This tunable conductivity is crucial for their application in nanoelectronics, offering potential for smaller, faster, and more energy-efficient transistors and sensors.  Their high aspect ratio and large surface area also contribute to their diverse applications; in chemistry, they serve as superior catalysts and adsorbents, while in biomedicine, their biocompatibility (depending on functionalization) allows for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications. The diverse properties of CNTs therefore necessitate a collaborative, interdisciplinary approach for realizing their full potential across various fields.
