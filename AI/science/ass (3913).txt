Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, transcends traditional disciplinary boundaries. This presentation explores the multifaceted pathways leading to black hole genesis, highlighting crucial interdisciplinary connections.  We will examine the stellar-mass black hole formation mechanism through core-collapse supernovae, emphasizing the need for sophisticated hydrodynamic simulations coupled with advanced nuclear physics models to accurately predict remnant properties and gravitational wave signatures.  Further, we delve into the formation of supermassive black holes, addressing the intriguing interplay between galactic dynamics, cosmological simulations, and the still debated mechanisms of direct collapse or seed black hole growth.  The analysis will encompass the crucial role of observational astronomy, including multi-wavelength data from X-ray binaries, active galactic nuclei, and gravitational wave events, which provide crucial empirical constraints on theoretical models. This interdisciplinary approach underscores the necessity of integrating expertise from astrophysics, nuclear physics, computational science, and cosmology to fully understand these enigmatic objects and their profound influence on the evolution of the universe.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the emerging field of black hole thermodynamics and its implications for fundamental physics.
