Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, represent a class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties, sparking intense scientific interest for decades.  Their unique structure, analogous to rolled-up sheets of graphene – a single layer of graphite – bestows upon them a remarkable combination of mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics unmatched by many conventional materials.  Imagine a material stronger than steel, yet significantly lighter, possessing the electrical conductivity of copper and the thermal conductivity exceeding that of diamond. This compelling profile is precisely what CNTs offer.  This research paper delves into the multifaceted properties of CNTs, exploring their inherent strengths, weaknesses, and functionalities. We will examine their mechanical resilience, drawing parallels to the tensile strength of spider silk, while analyzing their electrical behaviour, comparing it to the variability observed in semiconductor materials.  Furthermore, we will discuss their thermal conductivity, analogous to the efficient heat dissipation observed in certain gemstones, and explore the impact of chirality and diameter on these diverse properties.  Ultimately, this investigation aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the key attributes of CNTs and their implications for diverse technological applications.
