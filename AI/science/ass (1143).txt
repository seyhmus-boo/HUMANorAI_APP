Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, have emerged as a subject of intense interdisciplinary research. Their unique nanoscale structure, characterized by seamless hexagonal lattices of sp²-hybridized carbon atoms, underpins their remarkable functionalities. This paper explores the multifaceted properties of CNTs and their implications across diverse scientific and engineering fields.  We examine the intrinsic relationship between their structural characteristics – diameter, chirality, and defect density – and their resulting macroscopic behaviour.  Furthermore, we highlight the interdisciplinary nature of CNT research, encompassing materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering.  The synthesis and functionalization of CNTs, crucial for tailoring their properties, will be discussed within the context of chemical modifications and advanced fabrication techniques.  Finally, we will explore the diverse applications of CNTs, encompassing areas such as electronics, composites, energy storage, and biomedical engineering, underscoring the synergistic contributions from various disciplines essential to realizing their full potential. This integrated approach is crucial for translating the fundamental understanding of CNT properties into impactful technological advancements.
