Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamental concepts in chemistry, dictating the properties and reactivity of substances.  The primary types of bonding, ionic, covalent, and metallic, arise from electrostatic interactions between atoms. Ionic bonds result from the electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged ions formed by electron transfer, typically between metals and non-metals. Covalent bonds involve the sharing of electron pairs between atoms, prevalent in non-metal compounds. Metallic bonding, characterized by delocalized electrons within a lattice of metal cations, accounts for the properties of metals like conductivity and malleability.

Molecular structure, encompassing geometry and shape, is determined by valence shell electron pair repulsion (VSEPR) theory and hybridisation models. These dictate bond angles and molecular polarity, influencing physical properties like boiling point and solubility. Understanding bonding and structure is crucial for predicting reactivity. For example, the tetrahedral structure of methane explains its relative inertness, while the polar nature of water facilitates its role as a solvent. Practical applications span diverse fields: designing pharmaceuticals based on specific molecular interactions (e.g., drug-receptor binding), tailoring materials with desired electrical conductivity (e.g., semiconductors), and developing catalysts with optimized active sites for specific chemical reactions.  Ultimately, a thorough comprehension of bonding and structure is essential for progress across chemical sciences and related technologies.
