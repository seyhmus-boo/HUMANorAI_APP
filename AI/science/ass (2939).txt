The exceptional properties of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are intrinsically linked to their quantum mechanical structure.  Their sp² hybridized carbon atoms form a cylindrical lattice, a rolled-up graphene sheet, resulting in unique electronic and mechanical characteristics.  The chirality, defined by the chiral vector (n,m), dictates the nanotube's electronic band structure.  Armchair (n=m) nanotubes exhibit metallic conductivity due to the linear dispersion relation near the Fermi level, a direct consequence of the symmetry of their electronic wavefunctions.  Zigzag (m=0) and chiral (n≠m, m≠0) nanotubes, however, can be either metallic or semiconducting, dependent on the (n,m) values, which determine the band gap. This arises from the quantization of electron momentum along the circumferential direction, leading to discrete energy levels and the formation of a band gap in specific configurations. The strong covalent σ-bonds provide exceptional tensile strength, while the delocalized π-electrons contribute to high thermal conductivity.  Quantum confinement effects play a significant role, particularly in smaller diameter nanotubes, leading to altered optical and electronic properties compared to bulk graphite.  Furthermore, the unique electronic structure facilitates charge carrier mobility far exceeding that of silicon, making CNTs promising candidates for next-generation electronics.
