DNA replication, the semiconservative process generating two identical DNA duplexes from a single parent molecule, remains a central focus in molecular biology.  The core mechanism, involving unwinding by helicases, primer synthesis by primases, leading and lagging strand synthesis by DNA polymerases, and ligation by ligases, is well-established. However, recent research has illuminated intricate details and expanded our understanding.  Advances in single-molecule techniques have revealed the dynamic nature of replication forks, including the pausing and stalling events influenced by chromatin structure and DNA damage.  Studies employing high-throughput sequencing have provided comprehensive maps of replication origins and timing across diverse genomes, revealing unexpected complexities in spatiotemporal regulation.  Furthermore, research into the role of accessory proteins, particularly those involved in replication restart and lesion bypass, has highlighted the robustness and adaptability of the replication machinery in the face of challenging conditions.  Finally, the discovery and characterization of novel polymerases with specialized functions, such as translesion synthesis polymerases, underscore the intricate mechanisms maintaining genome integrity during replication. These ongoing investigations are refining our understanding of this fundamental biological process and its implications for genome stability and evolution.
