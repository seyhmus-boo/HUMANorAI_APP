Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, is a process driven by the strong nuclear force and governed by quantum mechanics.  This exothermic reaction releases a significant amount of energy, primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  The process is initiated by neutron bombardment, typically of fissile isotopes such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239.  Neutron absorption leads to an unstable, excited nucleus which subsequently undergoes fission, yielding a variety of fission products with varying mass numbers and associated radioactive decay chains.  The released neutrons, in turn, can induce further fission events, potentially leading to a chain reaction if the critical mass of fissile material is exceeded.  The precise fission products obtained are statistically distributed, depending on the target nucleus and the incident neutron energy.  Control over this chain reaction is paramount in nuclear reactors, utilizing neutron moderators and absorbers to maintain a controlled energy release.  The precise mechanism of fission, encompassing nuclear deformation, fragment separation, and neutron emission, remains an active area of research, with ongoing efforts to refine theoretical models and simulations.
