Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), allotropes of carbon with exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties, have garnered significant research interest for diverse applications.  Their unique cylindrical structure, comprising spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms, imparts remarkable strength and stiffness, surpassing that of steel at a fraction of the weight.  Electrical conductivity varies significantly depending on chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior, enabling their use in advanced electronics.  High thermal conductivity facilitates efficient heat dissipation.

Recent advancements focus on controlled synthesis techniques, including chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and laser ablation, enabling precise control over CNT diameter, length, and chirality, crucial for tailoring material properties.  Furthermore, significant progress has been made in functionalization strategies, incorporating diverse chemical groups to enhance dispersibility in solvents and compatibility with other materials.  This facilitates their integration into composite materials, resulting in enhanced mechanical reinforcement, improved electrical conductivity, and enhanced thermal management in applications ranging from aerospace to biomedical engineering.  Ongoing research explores the potential of CNTs in next-generation energy storage devices, flexible electronics, and high-performance computing, emphasizing the need for scalable and cost-effective production methods for widespread technological adoption.
