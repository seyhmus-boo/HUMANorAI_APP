Good morning. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission, the process underpinning nuclear power generation and weaponry.  Imagine an atom's nucleus, specifically a heavy one like Uranium-235, as a delicately balanced stack of building blocks. These "blocks" represent neutrons and protons.  A single extra neutron, akin to a poorly placed brick, can destabilize this precarious structure.  This destabilizing neutron triggers a chain reaction.  The nucleus, unable to maintain its configuration, *fissions*, splitting into two smaller nuclei â€“ imagine our stack collapsing into two smaller, albeit less stable, piles.

This splitting releases a tremendous amount of energy, analogous to the potential energy released when a tall stack of bricks collapses.  Crucially, this fission also releases more neutrons, acting as new "bricks" that destabilize other Uranium-235 nuclei, perpetuating a cascading chain reaction, exponentially increasing energy output.  Controlling this chain reaction is the cornerstone of nuclear reactor technology.  Without control, the uncontrolled release of energy results in a nuclear explosion, akin to an uncontrolled avalanche of collapsing bricks.  Therefore, understanding the delicate balance and chain reaction within nuclear fission is paramount.
