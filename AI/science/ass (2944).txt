DNA replication, the precise duplication of the genetic material, is fundamental to life.  This presentation will provide an overview of this crucial process, tracing its historical understanding from early conceptualizations to current molecular mechanisms.  Early experiments, such as the Meselson-Stahl experiment demonstrating semi-conservative replication, provided critical insights into the nature of DNA duplication.  We will then delve into the intricate molecular machinery involved, including the roles of key enzymes like DNA polymerase, helicase, primase, and ligase.  The presentation will explore the complexities of leading and lagging strand synthesis, the challenges of replicating the ends of linear chromosomes (telomeres), and the various checkpoints ensuring replication fidelity.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly touch upon the implications of replication errors in disease development and the therapeutic potential of targeting replication processes in cancer treatment.  By integrating historical context with contemporary knowledge, this presentation aims to illuminate the elegance and significance of DNA replication in maintaining the integrity of the genome and enabling life's continuity.
