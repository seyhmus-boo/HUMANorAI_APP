Nuclear fission, the splitting of atomic nuclei, represents a pivotal discovery with profound implications for energy production and global politics. This presentation provides a concise overview of fission processes, tracing their historical trajectory from the theoretical predictions of nuclear physicists like Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, building upon the work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann, to their practical realization in the Manhattan Project. We will examine the fundamental principles governing fission, including the role of neutron bombardment, critical mass, and the release of vast quantities of energy.  Different fissionable isotopes, notably Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, and their respective fission yields will be compared.  The presentation will then briefly address the various reactor designs exploiting these processes, contrasting controlled chain reactions in nuclear power plants with the uncontrolled reactions inherent in nuclear weapons.  Finally, we will touch upon the ongoing challenges and debates surrounding nuclear fission, encompassing issues of nuclear waste management, reactor safety, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons technology. This overview aims to provide a foundational understanding of this complex and consequential scientific phenomenon.
