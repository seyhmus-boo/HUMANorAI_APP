Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, the fundamental process by which a cell duplicates its genome.  This semi-conservative process ensures genetic continuity across generations.  Initiation involves unwinding the double helix at origins of replication, creating replication forks.  DNA polymerase, the key enzyme, then adds nucleotides to the 3' end of the newly synthesized strand, guided by base-pairing rules.  Leading and lagging strands are synthesized concurrently, the latter requiring Okazaki fragments and ligase.  High fidelity is maintained through proofreading mechanisms inherent to DNA polymerase.  Errors, though rare, can lead to mutations, forming the basis of genetic diversity and evolution.  Understanding DNA replication is crucial for various applications.  PCR, a cornerstone of molecular biology, exploits this process for DNA amplification in diagnostics and forensics.  Furthermore, advancements in our understanding inform cancer research, targeting replication machinery for therapeutic intervention.  Finally,  manipulating replication mechanisms holds promise for gene editing technologies like CRISPR-Cas9.
