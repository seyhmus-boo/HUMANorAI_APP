Photosynthesis, the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy, comprises two primary stages: the light-dependent reactions and the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle).  The light-dependent reactions can be likened to a water pump powered by sunlight.  Photons of light energize chlorophyll molecules within photosystems, analogous to the sun powering the pump. This energy excites electrons, which are then passed along an electron transport chain, much like water being pumped through pipes.  This electron flow generates a proton gradient across the thylakoid membrane, creating a reservoir of potential energy, similar to water building up behind a dam.  The potential energy is then harnessed to produce ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cellular energy currency, via chemiosmosis –  the release of water from behind the dam generating energy to turn a turbine.  Simultaneously, water molecules are split (photolysis), releasing oxygen as a byproduct – the exhaust from the pump.  The light-independent reactions, or Calvin cycle, resemble a factory assembling products.  The ATP and NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) generated in the light-dependent reactions act as the factory's energy and building blocks, respectively.  Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere enters the factory, and through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, it is converted into glucose, the final product – a car assembled from its components.  This glucose represents the stored chemical energy, providing the plant with fuel for growth and metabolism.
