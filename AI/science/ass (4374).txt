The formation of black holes, regions of spacetime with gravity so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape, is a cornerstone of modern astrophysics.  Early theoretical groundwork, laid by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century, posited the existence of "dark stars" based on Newtonian physics.  However, a rigorous understanding emerged only with Einstein's general theory of relativity in the early 20th century, which predicted the existence of black holes as solutions to the field equations.  

Primarily, stellar-mass black holes form from the gravitational collapse of massive stars (â‰¥20 solar masses) at the end of their lifecycle.  Following core collapse supernovae, if the remnant exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit, further gravitational collapse ensues, preventing neutron star formation and culminating in a singularity.  Supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, pose a more complex origin problem. While accretion of surrounding matter and mergers of smaller black holes are contributing factors, their initial seed formation remains an active area of research, with theories ranging from direct collapse of primordial gas clouds to runaway stellar mergers in dense star clusters. The detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes, a key prediction of general relativity, has provided crucial observational evidence supporting these theoretical models and revolutionized our understanding of black hole formation and the dynamic universe.
