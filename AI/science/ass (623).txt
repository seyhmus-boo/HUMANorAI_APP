Nuclear fission processes represent the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei, accompanied by the release of a significant amount of energy.  Imagine a carefully balanced stack of dominoes: each domino represents a nucleon (proton or neutron) within the nucleus.  In a heavy nucleus like uranium-235, this stack is precariously balanced, representing a state of high potential energy.  Introducing a single neutron, akin to nudging a domino at the edge of the stack, initiates a chain reaction.  This neutron absorption triggers a cascade effect: the nucleus becomes unstable, fracturing into smaller nuclei (the "dominoes" falling) â€“ fragments that are more stable and possess lower potential energy.  The difference in energy between the initial state and the final state is released primarily as kinetic energy of the fission fragments and emitted neutrons.  These liberated neutrons, in turn, can initiate further fission events in neighboring nuclei, leading to a self-sustaining chain reaction, much like the cascading fall of the entire domino stack.  However, unlike a simple domino effect, the energy released in nuclear fission is many orders of magnitude greater, owing to the strong nuclear force binding nucleons together.  Control over this chain reaction is crucial for harnessing the energy safely, as uncontrolled fission leads to a rapid and catastrophic energy release, as seen in a nuclear explosion.
