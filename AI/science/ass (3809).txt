Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical structures composed of spÂ²-hybridized carbon atoms, exhibit exceptional material properties that have garnered significant scientific and technological interest.  This paper reviews the fundamental properties of CNTs, focusing on their unique mechanical, electrical, and thermal characteristics.  We examine the influence of chirality and diameter on these properties, highlighting the diverse range of behaviors observed across different CNT types.  Specifically, the exceptional tensile strength and Young's modulus of CNTs, significantly exceeding those of steel, are discussed in relation to their potential applications in high-strength composites.  Furthermore, the analysis explores the electrical properties, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behavior depending on chirality, and their implications for nanoelectronics.  The inherent high thermal conductivity of CNTs, offering potential for advanced thermal management systems, is also critically reviewed.  Finally, this paper considers the challenges and opportunities associated with the large-scale production and functionalization of CNTs for diverse applications, underscoring the ongoing research efforts towards realizing their full potential across various technological sectors.
