Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  Unlike classical mechanics which predicts stable nuclei, quantum tunnelling allows for the surmounting of the Coulomb barrier separating nucleons.  The strong nuclear force, while short-ranged, is crucial; its probabilistic nature, described by wavefunctions, governs the likelihood of a nucleus undergoing fission.  Spontaneous fission arises from the quantum mechanical fluctuations within the nucleus, resulting in a configuration exceeding the fission barrier.  Induced fission, commonly employed in nuclear reactors, exploits the absorption of a neutron, which introduces additional energy and alters the nuclear wavefunction, increasing the probability of tunnelling through the fission barrier.  The resulting fragments aren't predictably determined, reflecting the probabilistic nature of the quantum wavefunction collapse upon fission.  The energy released during fission originates from the mass defect, a consequence of the binding energy differences between the parent nucleus and its fission products,  a manifestation of Einstein's mass-energy equivalence, E=mcÂ².  Therefore, a complete understanding of nuclear fission necessitates a quantum mechanical framework, acknowledging the probabilistic and wave-like nature of both nucleons and the nuclear potential.
