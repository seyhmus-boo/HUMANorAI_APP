This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on the underlying physics and their significant practical applications. We will explore the mechanisms driving nuclear fission, specifically the role of neutron bombardment and the subsequent chain reaction, highlighting the crucial factors influencing reaction rates such as critical mass and neutron cross-sections.  Different types of fissionable isotopes, including Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239, and their respective fission yields will be discussed.  Furthermore, the presentation will delineate the various methods employed for controlling chain reactions, emphasizing the design and function of nuclear reactors.  The practical applications of nuclear fission will be examined, concentrating on its crucial role in electricity generation via nuclear power plants, a vital component of global energy production.  The presentation will also briefly address the utilization of fission in medical isotopes production for diagnostic and therapeutic applications, and its past and potential future role in propulsion systems for spacecraft. Finally, we will touch upon the challenges associated with nuclear waste management and the ongoing efforts towards safer and more sustainable nuclear technologies.
