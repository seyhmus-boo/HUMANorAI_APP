Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of massive stars.  Historically, the theoretical groundwork was laid by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the late 18th century, who conceptually described "dark stars" – objects so massive that even light could not escape their gravitational pull.  Einstein's theory of General Relativity, however, provided the rigorous framework for understanding black hole formation.

The process begins with a star many times more massive than our Sun, which eventually exhausts its nuclear fuel.  Without the outward pressure generated by nuclear fusion to counterbalance gravity, the star's core implodes catastrophically.  If the core's mass exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit (~3 solar masses), even neutron degeneracy pressure, which supports neutron stars, is insufficient to resist further collapse. This leads to the formation of a singularity, a point of infinite density, surrounded by an event horizon – the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  The collapse results in a black hole, whose properties are entirely determined by its mass, charge, and angular momentum.  Observationally, black holes are identified through their gravitational influence on surrounding matter, manifested in phenomena like accretion disks and relativistic jets.
