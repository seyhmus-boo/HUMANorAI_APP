Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, represents a pivotal process in nuclear physics and technology.  Its discovery, stemming from the work of Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and subsequently interpreted by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch, fundamentally altered scientific understanding of the atom and unleashed immense energy potential.  This process, primarily involving uranium-235 or plutonium-239 isotopes, is initiated by neutron bombardment, triggering a chain reaction where released neutrons induce further fissions.  The mass defect resulting from the fission process, as described by Einstein's mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²), accounts for the enormous energy release, primarily in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments and prompt neutrons.  Controlled fission reactions are harnessed in nuclear reactors for electricity generation, while uncontrolled reactions constitute the basis of nuclear weapons.  The inherent dangers associated with fission, including radioactive waste generation and the potential for catastrophic accidents, necessitate rigorous safety protocols and ongoing research into improved reactor designs and waste management strategies.  Furthermore, ongoing research explores advanced fuel cycles and novel reactor designs aimed at enhancing safety and efficiency.
