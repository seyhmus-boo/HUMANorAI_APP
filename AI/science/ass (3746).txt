Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy nucleus into lighter nuclei, is fundamentally a quantum mechanical process.  The stability of a nucleus is governed by the interplay of the strong nuclear force, binding nucleons together, and the Coulomb repulsion between protons.  In heavy nuclei, the Coulomb repulsion becomes increasingly dominant, overcoming the strong force's short-range nature. This leads to a potential energy landscape with multiple minima, representing various fission fragment configurations.

Quantum tunneling plays a crucial role.  The probability of a nucleus spontaneously overcoming the potential energy barrier separating the initial state from a fission configuration is determined by the tunneling probability, calculated via solutions to the time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation for the nuclear system.  This probability is highly sensitive to the nuclear shape and the height and width of the potential barrier, explaining the observed variations in fission rates across different isotopes.  Furthermore, the emission of neutrons during fission is a consequence of the excited states of the resulting fragments, which decay via neutron emission, a process also described by quantum mechanical transition probabilities.  The precise energy and angular distribution of these neutrons are governed by the quantum states involved.
