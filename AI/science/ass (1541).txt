Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon, exhibit exceptional mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties that have spurred significant interest for diverse technological applications.  Their unique structure, consisting of spÂ² hybridized carbon atoms arranged in hexagonal lattices, results in remarkably high tensile strength, exceeding that of steel by orders of magnitude.  Electrical conductivity varies dramatically depending on chirality, with some CNTs behaving as metallic conductors while others exhibit semiconducting behaviour, offering tunability for electronic device fabrication.  Furthermore, CNTs possess exceptionally high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  However, challenges remain in controlling CNT synthesis to achieve uniform chirality and length distributions, as well as in scalable and cost-effective functionalization for improved dispersion and integration into composite materials.  Ongoing research focuses on addressing these challenges to fully exploit the potential of CNTs in advanced materials for applications ranging from high-performance composites and energy storage to biomedical devices and sensors.  Further investigation into the effects of defects and functionalization on CNT properties remains crucial for realizing their full technological promise.
