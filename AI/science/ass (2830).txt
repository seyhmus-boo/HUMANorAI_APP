The study of black hole formation presents significant experimental challenges, hindering a complete understanding of this fundamental astrophysical process.  Direct observation remains elusive due to the inherent nature of black holes, which trap all forms of electromagnetic radiation.  Instead, researchers rely on indirect methods, primarily gravitational wave detection and observations of stellar remnants in binary systems.  LIGO and Virgo's detection of gravitational waves from merging black holes provides crucial data on the final stages of formation, but information regarding the earlier phases remains scarce.  Modelling the collapse of massive stars, while theoretically advanced, relies on complex numerical simulations that are sensitive to input parameters like equation of state and initial stellar rotation.  Moreover, the observational constraints on progenitor stars and their evolution are often limited, leading to uncertainties in modelling.  High-resolution imaging techniques, such as Event Horizon Telescope observations, offer unprecedented views of the black hole's immediate vicinity but cannot directly trace the formation process itself.  Ultimately, overcoming these challenges requires advancements in both observational technologies, including more sensitive gravitational wave detectors and next-generation telescopes, and theoretical modelling, incorporating more realistic physics and leveraging multi-messenger astronomy.
