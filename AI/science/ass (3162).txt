Black hole formation represents a critical endpoint in stellar evolution, dictated primarily by initial stellar mass and composition.  For stars exceeding approximately 20 solar masses, core collapse supernovae provide the dominant formation pathway.  Following the exhaustion of nuclear fuel, the core undergoes gravitational collapse, exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit and triggering runaway implosion.  The immense pressure and density at the core's center overwhelm degeneracy pressure, resulting in a singularity â€“ the hallmark of a black hole.  For less massive stars, the fate is less certain, with neutron star formation generally favoured. However, binary systems can facilitate black hole formation via accretion onto a neutron star companion, exceeding the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit and inducing collapse.  Less frequently, direct collapse scenarios in low-metallicity environments, circumventing the supernova stage, are also considered.  Further investigation into the precise mechanisms and conditions leading to black hole formation remains crucial to advancing our understanding of stellar astrophysics and the cosmological distribution of these enigmatic objects.
