Nuclear fission, the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, underpins current nuclear power generation.  The process typically involves bombarding fissile isotopes, such as Uranium-235 or Plutonium-239, with neutrons. This induces nuclear instability, leading to fission and the release of further neutrons, sustaining a chain reaction.  The energy released is primarily in the form of kinetic energy of fission fragments, subsequently converted to heat.

Recent developments focus on enhancing efficiency and safety.  Advanced reactor designs, such as Generation IV reactors, aim for improved fuel utilization through closed-cycle fuel systems and enhanced neutron economy, minimizing waste and improving proliferation resistance.  Research into Accelerator Driven Subcritical Systems (ADS) explores the use of particle accelerators to drive the fission chain reaction, offering enhanced control and potential for transmutation of nuclear waste.  Moreover, significant efforts are dedicated to developing more resilient and passively safe reactor designs, mitigating the risk of meltdowns through inherent safety features.  These advancements aim to address concerns surrounding nuclear waste management, reactor safety, and proliferation, paving the way for a more sustainable and secure future for nuclear energy.
