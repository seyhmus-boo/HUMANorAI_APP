Black hole formation represents a dramatic endpoint in stellar evolution, dictated by the interplay of gravity and pressure.  Imagine a massive star, a celestial furnace fueled by nuclear fusion, as a colossal balloon inflated by internal pressure counteracting its immense self-gravity.  When the star exhausts its nuclear fuel, this pressure dwindles, analogous to slowly deflating the balloon.  For sufficiently massive stars (generally exceeding 20 solar masses), this deflation is catastrophic.  Gravity overwhelms the diminished internal forces, causing a runaway collapse.

This collapse proceeds through several stages, initially involving the formation of a neutron star, a hyperdense remnant where electrons are forced into protons forming neutrons.  However, if the stellar core exceeds the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit—a critical mass beyond which even neutron degeneracy pressure cannot withstand gravity—the collapse continues unchecked.  This is like puncturing the balloon entirely; the stellar material implodes upon itself, forming a singularity, a point of infinite density.  The surrounding spacetime is warped so severely that it creates a black hole, a region from which not even light can escape—a cosmic drain, perpetually swallowing anything that crosses its event horizon, the point of no return.  The black hole's formation marks a transition from a luminous, energy-producing star to a dark, gravitationally dominant object, altering the galactic landscape profoundly.
