Nuclear fission, the splitting of a heavy atomic nucleus into lighter nuclei, is a process with profound implications across multiple disciplines.  Physically, the process hinges on the strong and weak nuclear forces, governed by quantum mechanics.  The immense energy released, stemming from the mass-energy equivalence (E=mcÂ²), is a central tenet of physics, with applications in engineering for power generation and weaponry.  

Chemically, the fission process produces radioactive isotopes with varying half-lives, necessitating interdisciplinary collaboration between chemists and physicists to manage nuclear waste and develop separation techniques.  Furthermore, the biological impact of radiation necessitates the involvement of biologists and medical professionals to study its effects on living organisms and develop mitigation strategies.  Finally, the socio-political ramifications, concerning energy policy, nuclear proliferation, and environmental ethics, demand input from political scientists, economists, and ethicists.  In conclusion, understanding nuclear fission requires a comprehensive, interdisciplinary approach.
