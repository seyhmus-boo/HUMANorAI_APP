Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on DNA replication, the fundamental process by which cells create an exact copy of their DNA.  This semi-conservative process, elucidated by Meselson and Stahl, involves unwinding the double helix by enzymes like helicase, exposing the nucleotide bases.  DNA polymerase III then adds complementary nucleotides to each strand, guided by base-pairing rules (A with T, G with C).  Leading and lagging strands are synthesized differently, with the latter requiring Okazaki fragments and ligase for joining.  Proofreading mechanisms minimize errors, ensuring fidelity.  

The accuracy of DNA replication is paramount for maintaining genetic integrity.  Errors, however, can lead to mutations, forming the basis of genetic variation and evolution.  Practically, understanding DNA replication is crucial in various fields.  In molecular biology, it underpins techniques like PCR, enabling DNA amplification for diagnostics and forensic science.  Furthermore, manipulating DNA replication mechanisms is explored in cancer research, targeting replication errors in tumor cells for therapeutic interventions.  Thus, a thorough understanding of this process is vital for advancements in numerous scientific disciplines.
