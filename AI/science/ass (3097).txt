Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Iijima in 1991 using transmission electron microscopy, exhibit exceptional properties stemming from their unique spÂ²-hybridized carbon structure.  These cylindrical molecules, typically categorized as single-walled nanotubes (SWCNTs) or multi-walled nanotubes (MWCNTs), possess remarkable mechanical strength, with tensile strengths exceeding that of steel, owing to the strong covalent bonds between carbon atoms.  Their electrical conductivity is highly dependent on chirality, ranging from metallic to semiconducting behaviour.  This tunability, alongside their high aspect ratio and surface area, makes them attractive for diverse applications.  Furthermore, CNTs exhibit exceptional thermal conductivity along their axial direction, exceeding that of copper.  However, challenges remain, including controlling chirality during synthesis to achieve desired electrical properties and overcoming issues related to dispersion and functionalization for effective integration into composite materials.  Ongoing research focuses on harnessing their potential in fields ranging from electronics and composites to energy storage and biomedical applications.
