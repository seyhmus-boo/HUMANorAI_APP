Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, stems from the collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  Historically, the concept emerged from John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace's 18th-century speculations on "dark stars," objects so massive that even light couldn't escape their gravitational pull.  Einstein's theory of General Relativity, however, provided the rigorous theoretical framework, demonstrating that the immense gravitational field of a collapsing star could warp spacetime into a singularity – a point of infinite density.

The process begins with a star's core exhausting its nuclear fuel.  For stars exceeding approximately three times the mass of our Sun, the inward gravitational force overwhelms the outward pressure from degenerate matter, initiating a runaway collapse.  This collapse is highly dependent on the star's initial mass and composition, influencing the formation pathway, potentially leading to a direct collapse to a black hole or an intermediate supernova phase. The collapse continues until the singularity forms, surrounded by an event horizon – the boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  The resulting black hole's mass, angular momentum, and electric charge are determined by the progenitor star's properties.  Alternative formation mechanisms, including direct collapse of massive gas clouds in the early universe, are also being actively researched.
