Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), cylindrical allotropes of carbon with exceptional structural and electronic properties, have garnered significant attention across diverse scientific disciplines since their discovery.  Their unique characteristics, stemming from their spÂ² hybridized carbon structure, present unprecedented opportunities for technological advancements.  This research paper will explore the key properties of CNTs, focusing on their mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and thermal conductivity. We will examine the influence of chirality and diameter on these properties, highlighting the variations observed between single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs).  The exceptional mechanical strength of CNTs, exceeding that of steel, makes them ideal for reinforcing composite materials, leading to applications in aerospace and automotive industries.  Furthermore, their high electrical conductivity and unique electronic band structures pave the way for advanced electronic devices, including transistors and sensors.  Their superior thermal conductivity offers potential for thermal management applications in electronics and energy storage.  This paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of these remarkable properties and discuss their implications for a range of practical applications, considering both the challenges and future prospects of CNT-based technologies.
