Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally explained by quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of atomic orbitals, governed by the Pauli Exclusion Principle and the minimization of the system's total energy.  Specifically, the overlapping of atomic orbitals leads to the formation of molecular orbitals, which are delocalized over multiple atoms.  Constructive interference of wavefunctions results in bonding molecular orbitals, lower in energy than the constituent atomic orbitals, stabilizing the molecule. Destructive interference forms antibonding orbitals, higher in energy and destabilizing.

The distribution of electrons within these molecular orbitals dictates the molecule's geometry.  Molecular geometries are predicted by minimizing electron-electron repulsion and maximizing electron-nuclear attraction, as described by Valence Bond Theory and Molecular Orbital Theory.  Hybridization of atomic orbitals, a quantum mechanical phenomenon, further explains the observed geometries and bonding characteristics of molecules, accounting for variations from simple orbital overlap models.  Ultimately, the precise structure of a molecule is a consequence of the quantized energy levels and the wave-like nature of electrons.
