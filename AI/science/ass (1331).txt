Carbon nanotubes (CNTs), discovered by Sumio Iijima in 1991, represent a remarkable class of nanomaterials with exceptional properties stemming from their unique structure: cylindrical sheets of sp²-bonded carbon atoms.  Their discovery revolutionized materials science, opening avenues for numerous applications.  A key property is their extraordinary mechanical strength; CNTs possess tensile strengths significantly exceeding that of steel, making them ideal for reinforcement in composites.  Their electrical properties are equally impressive, exhibiting either metallic or semiconducting behaviour depending on their chirality – the arrangement of carbon atoms within the nanotube lattice. This tunable conductivity makes them promising for electronics and sensing applications.

Furthermore, CNTs exhibit high thermal conductivity, facilitating efficient heat dissipation.  Their large surface area-to-volume ratio leads to significant adsorption capabilities, useful in gas storage and catalysis.  However, challenges remain.  The precise control over CNT synthesis to obtain desired chirality and purity is crucial for consistent performance.  Furthermore, the tendency for CNTs to aggregate necessitates effective dispersion techniques for practical implementation.  Despite these challenges, the exceptional combination of mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties positions CNTs as a leading material for future technological advancements.
