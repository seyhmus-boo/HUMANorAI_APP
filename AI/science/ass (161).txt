Good morning. Today's lecture concerns nuclear fission processes.  Imagine an atom's nucleus as a meticulously balanced stack of building blocks – neutrons and protons.  In certain isotopes, such as Uranium-235, this stack is inherently unstable, analogous to a precariously balanced Jenga tower.  Introducing a single neutron, our "trigger," disrupts this equilibrium.  This neutron acts like a perfectly placed Jenga block removal, causing a cascade.  The nucleus splits, or "fissions," into smaller nuclei, like our Jenga tower collapsing into smaller piles.  Crucially, this fission releases further neutrons, acting as additional triggers, causing a chain reaction – a domino effect of collapsing Jenga towers.  This chain reaction, controlled in nuclear reactors and uncontrolled in nuclear weapons, releases enormous energy.  The energy released is analogous to the potential energy stored in our meticulously constructed tower suddenly being unleashed as it falls.  This energy conversion from mass to energy, governed by Einstein's famous equation E=mc², is the fundamental principle behind the immense power of nuclear fission.
