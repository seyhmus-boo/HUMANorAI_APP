Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, arises from the gravitational collapse of extremely massive stars.  Historically, the theoretical groundwork was laid by John Michell and Pierre-Simon Laplace in the 18th century, who conceived of "dark stars" – objects so massive that even light couldn't escape their gravity.  However, a rigorous understanding emerged only with Einstein's theory of General Relativity in the early 20th century, which provided the framework for describing the extreme spacetime curvature near these objects.

The process begins when a star, at least several times the mass of our Sun, exhausts its nuclear fuel.  The outward pressure from nuclear fusion ceases, and the star's immense gravity overcomes internal resistance.  This leads to a catastrophic inward collapse, compressing matter to an unimaginable density.  If the stellar remnant's mass exceeds a critical threshold (the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit), the collapse continues unabated, forming a singularity – a point of infinite density – at the center, surrounded by an event horizon, beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  This marks the birth of a black hole, a region of spacetime with such intense gravity that it fundamentally alters the fabric of the universe.
