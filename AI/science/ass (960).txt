Black hole formation, a cornerstone of modern astrophysics, represents a captivating intersection of theoretical physics and observational astronomy.  The collapse of massive stars, predicted by Einstein's theory of General Relativity, constitutes the most widely accepted mechanism for stellar-mass black hole genesis.  This process, characterized by the inexorable gravitational implosion of a stellar remnant exceeding the Chandrasekhar limit, results in a singularity shrouded by an event horizonâ€”a boundary beyond which not even light can escape.  Beyond stellar-mass black holes, supermassive counterparts residing at galactic centers pose a significant area of ongoing research, with their formation mechanisms remaining a subject of considerable debate, encompassing scenarios ranging from the accretion of gas to the merger of smaller black holes.  Understanding black hole formation is crucial not only for advancing our comprehension of stellar evolution and galactic dynamics but also holds practical implications.  For instance, the detection of gravitational waves emanating from merging black holes, as observed by LIGO and Virgo, provides a unique probe of strong-field gravity and tests the limits of General Relativity.  Furthermore,  the study of accretion disks around black holes offers insights into the generation of powerful jets and their impact on galactic environments, potentially aiding in the understanding and prediction of active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity.
