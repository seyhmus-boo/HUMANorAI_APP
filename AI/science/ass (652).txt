Chemical bonding and molecular structure are fundamentally explained by quantum mechanics.  The formation of a chemical bond arises from the interaction of atomic orbitals, governed by the Pauli exclusion principle and the principles of minimum energy.  Specifically, the overlapping of atomic orbitals leads to the formation of molecular orbitals, which encompass the entire molecule.  Constructive interference of wave functions results in bonding molecular orbitals, lower in energy than the constituent atomic orbitals, leading to stability.  Conversely, destructive interference forms antibonding molecular orbitals, higher in energy.

The distribution of electrons within these molecular orbitals dictates the molecule's geometry.  Electron repulsion, described by Coulomb's law, influences bond angles and overall molecular shape, minimizing electron-electron interactions.  Furthermore, the hybridization of atomic orbitals, a quantum mechanical phenomenon, often explains deviations from idealized geometries predicted by simple valence bond theory. Ultimately, the molecular structure represents the lowest energy configuration of nuclei and electrons, as determined by the solution of the Schr√∂dinger equation, albeit often through approximation methods.  This understanding allows prediction of molecular properties such as reactivity and spectroscopic characteristics.
