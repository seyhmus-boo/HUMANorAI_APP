Catalysts in organic chemistry are substances that accelerate reaction rates without being consumed in the overall process.  Their function stems from the ability to lower the activation energy of a reaction by providing an alternative reaction pathway with a lower energy transition state. This is typically achieved through the formation of intermediate complexes between the catalyst and reactants, facilitating bond breaking and formation.  Catalysts can be homogeneous, dissolving in the reaction mixture, or heterogeneous, existing in a separate phase.

Homogeneous catalysts often exhibit high selectivity due to specific interactions with substrates, while heterogeneous catalysts are generally more easily separated from the product mixture.  Practical applications are vast.  Acid catalysts, such as sulfuric acid, are widely used in esterification and dehydration reactions.  Transition metal catalysts, like palladium and platinum, are crucial in cross-coupling reactions, forming carbon-carbon bonds pivotal in pharmaceutical and materials science.  Enzyme catalysis, a biological form of catalysis, underpins numerous biochemical processes and finds increasing use in green chemistry, offering high selectivity and operating under mild conditions.  The design and application of novel catalysts remain a key focus in organic chemistry, driving advancements in sustainable and efficient synthesis.
