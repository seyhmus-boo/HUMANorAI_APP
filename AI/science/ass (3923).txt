Quantum entanglement, a cornerstone of quantum mechanics, describes a phenomenon where two or more quantum systems become linked in such a way that their fates are intertwined, regardless of the spatial separation between them.  This interconnectedness transcends classical correlations, exhibiting a non-local correlation that violates Bell's inequalities.  Mathematically, entangled states are represented by superposition states that cannot be factored into individual states of the constituent systems.  For instance, a maximally entangled Bell state of two qubits, often represented as |Φ⁺⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2, illustrates this inseparability; measuring the state of one qubit instantaneously determines the state of the other, regardless of the distance separating them. This instantaneous correlation, however, does not permit faster-than-light communication, as the outcome of the measurement on each qubit remains probabilistic until measured.  The profound implications of entanglement extend to various areas of quantum information science, forming the basis for quantum computing, quantum cryptography, and quantum teleportation, showcasing the intrinsically non-classical nature of the quantum realm.  Understanding entanglement is crucial for comprehending the fundamental principles governing quantum systems and harnessing their unique capabilities.
