Black hole formation arises from the gravitational collapse of sufficiently massive stars.  When a star exhausts its nuclear fuel, the outward pressure from fusion ceases, and its own immense gravity overwhelms all opposing forces.  This leads to a catastrophic inward collapse, compressing the stellar core beyond the point of no return.  The density increases to a singularity, a point of infinite density and zero volume, surrounded by an event horizonâ€”a boundary beyond which nothing, not even light, can escape.  The mass of the progenitor star determines the black hole's mass, with more massive stars producing more massive black holes.  Stellar-mass black holes are formed through this process, while supermassive black holes, residing at galactic centers, likely form through accretion of matter and mergers of smaller black holes.

While directly observing black holes is impossible due to the event horizon, their presence is inferred through gravitational effects on nearby matter.  This observable behaviour finds practical applications in astrophysical research. Observing the orbital dynamics of stars around unseen massive objects provides evidence for black hole existence and allows mass estimations. Studying gravitational waves emitted during black hole mergers, as detected by LIGO and Virgo, offers insights into the properties of these enigmatic objects and tests Einstein's theory of general relativity. This research also contributes to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution.
