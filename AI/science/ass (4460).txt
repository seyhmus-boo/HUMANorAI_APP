This presentation provides a concise overview of nuclear fission processes, focusing on the underlying physics and their diverse practical applications.  We will begin by examining the fundamental principles governing nuclear fission, including neutron-induced fission, criticality, and the release of energy through mass defect.  The role of isotopes, particularly uranium-235 and plutonium-239, in sustaining chain reactions will be highlighted.  Different fission reactor designs, including pressurized water reactors (PWRs) and boiling water reactors (BWRs), will be briefly compared, emphasizing their respective advantages and disadvantages in terms of safety, efficiency, and waste management.

Beyond electricity generation, the presentation will explore additional applications of nuclear fission.  These include the production of medical isotopes for diagnosis and treatment, the use of fission in research reactors for materials science and neutron scattering studies, and the potential role of nuclear fission in deep space exploration through radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs).  Finally, we will briefly address the challenges associated with nuclear fission, such as nuclear waste disposal and the prevention of nuclear proliferation, acknowledging the crucial need for responsible development and implementation of this powerful technology.
