Nuclear fission is the process whereby a heavy atomic nucleus, typically uranium or plutonium, splits into two or more lighter nuclei, releasing a significant amount of energy in the process.  Imagine a carefully balanced stack of dominoes;  the heavy nucleus is akin to this precariously balanced structure, representing a state of high potential energy.  A single neutron, acting like a carefully placed nudge, initiates a chain reaction. This "nudge" triggers the collapse of the domino stack – analogous to the nucleus splitting – causing a cascade effect.  Each splitting nucleus releases further neutrons, which in turn trigger the fission of other nuclei, mimicking the toppling of multiple dominoes simultaneously. This self-sustaining chain reaction is responsible for the immense energy release characteristic of nuclear fission.  However, unlike the dominoes, which eventually run out, the fission process can be controlled through the careful regulation of neutron absorption. This control, represented by strategically placed barriers between dominoes, allows for a sustained, yet managed, energy release, enabling the harnessing of nuclear power for electricity generation.  Uncontrolled chain reactions, on the other hand, result in the rapid and uncontrolled release of energy, as seen in nuclear weapons, where the analogy breaks down due to the explosive scale.
