Black hole formation, a cornerstone of astrophysics, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding a multifaceted approach integrating diverse fields. This presentation explores the multifaceted pathways leading to black hole genesis, emphasizing the crucial interplay between astrophysics, nuclear physics, and computational science.  We will examine the stellar-mass black hole formation pathway, focusing on the role of stellar evolution and supernovae.  The intricate interplay of nuclear processes within the collapsing stellar core, dictated by equations of state and weak interaction rates, is paramount in determining the final remnant's fate.  We will then transition to supermassive black hole formation, highlighting the challenges of explaining their rapid growth observed in the early universe.  This discussion involves theoretical models encompassing direct collapse scenarios and mergers of smaller black holes, which significantly benefit from high-performance computing simulations to model the complex gravitational dynamics.  Finally, we will briefly discuss the interdisciplinary implications for gravitational wave astronomy and multi-messenger astronomy, demonstrating how observations across the electromagnetic spectrum, neutrinos, and gravitational waves are crucial for validating and refining our theoretical understanding of black hole formation across all mass scales. The integration of these disparate fields promises to unlock deeper insights into the universe's most enigmatic objects.
