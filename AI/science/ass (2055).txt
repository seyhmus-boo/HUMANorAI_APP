Black hole formation represents a pivotal process in astrophysical evolution, shaping galactic structure and driving energetic phenomena. This presentation reviews the dominant pathways leading to black hole formation, focusing on the stellar-mass and supermassive regimes.  We will examine the collapse of massive stars, highlighting the roles of stellar metallicity, rotation, and magnetic fields in determining the final fate of the progenitor.  The crucial role of pair-instability supernovae in shaping the upper mass limit for black hole formation from stellar collapse will be discussed.  For supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we will explore competing formation scenarios, including direct collapse of primordial gas clouds in high-redshift environments and the growth of stellar-mass seeds through accretion and mergers.  Recent advancements in numerical simulations, gravitational-wave astronomy, and multi-wavelength observations are providing increasingly refined constraints on these models.  We will conclude by highlighting open questions in the field, such as the precise mechanisms driving SMBH growth and the interplay between SMBH formation and galaxy evolution, emphasizing the need for further theoretical and observational investigations.
