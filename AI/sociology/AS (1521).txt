The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, defying simple causal inference. While ostensibly designed to improve societal welfare, economic policies often exhibit unintended consequences, making empirical evaluation challenging.  Experimental approaches, while promising, encounter significant hurdles.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard, are often impractical due to ethical constraints and the sheer scale of policy interventions.  Furthermore, isolating the impact of a specific policy from myriad confounding factors – demographic shifts, technological advancements, global economic fluctuations – proves incredibly difficult.  Spillover effects across geographical areas or social groups further complicate analysis, necessitating sophisticated econometric techniques that struggle with potential endogeneity biases.  Finally, the subjective nature of well-being, encompassing dimensions like happiness, health, and social cohesion, poses measurement challenges.  Quantitative proxies, while useful, may not fully capture the nuanced impacts of economic policies on individuals' lived experiences, thus limiting the conclusive power of experimental investigations.
