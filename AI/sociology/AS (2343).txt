This paper investigates the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simplistic correlation to explore nuanced causal pathways.  We posit that while economic growth is often considered a prerequisite for improved social well-being, its impact is significantly mediated by the specific policy choices implemented.  Using a comparative analysis of diverse national contexts, we demonstrate that policies emphasizing inclusive growth, equitable distribution of wealth, and robust social safety nets correlate strongly with higher levels of social well-being, as measured by indices incorporating factors such as health, education, and social inclusion.  Conversely, policies focused solely on maximizing GDP, neglecting income inequality and social protection, often yield diminished social well-being despite overall economic expansion.  Our findings highlight the critical role of targeted interventions such as progressive taxation, investments in human capital, and accessible healthcare systems in translating economic growth into tangible improvements in citizens' lives.  Practical applications include informing policy design to prioritize equitable growth strategies and evaluating the social impact of economic policies beyond purely economic metrics, ultimately enabling the creation of more just and prosperous societies.
