Class inequality, a persistent societal feature throughout history, refers to the unequal distribution of resources, power, and opportunities across different social strata.  Historical examples range from ancient slave societies to feudal systems and modern capitalism, each exhibiting unique manifestations of class stratification.  While the specific mechanisms vary, the core issue remains: the concentration of wealth and privilege in the hands of a minority disproportionately impacts the lives and prospects of the majority.

The effects of class inequality are multifaceted and far-reaching.  Economically, it restricts social mobility, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting overall economic growth.  Socially, it fosters resentment, conflict, and social unrest, potentially manifesting in higher crime rates and political instability.  Furthermore, unequal access to quality education, healthcare, and other essential services exacerbates health disparities and limits human potential across generations.  Ultimately, significant class inequality undermines social cohesion and jeopardizes the overall well-being of a society, necessitating comprehensive policy interventions to address its root causes and mitigate its detrimental consequences.
