This presentation examines the evolving role of education in shaping social norms, considering recent developments in pedagogical theory and societal shifts.  While traditionally focused on transmitting knowledge and skills, education increasingly recognizes its crucial influence on shaping attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that underpin social norms.  Recent research highlights the efficacy of  interventions integrating social and emotional learning (SEL) curricula, demonstrating a positive correlation between SEL skills and prosocial behaviors, like empathy and cooperation.  Furthermore, the rise of digital technologies has presented both challenges and opportunities.  While online platforms can amplify harmful norms, they also offer potential for targeted interventions and the dissemination of inclusive narratives, fostering positive social change.  This presentation will explore these advancements, discussing the limitations and ethical considerations of employing educational strategies to influence social norms.  Specific examples will be drawn from contemporary research on interventions targeting issues such as gender equality, environmental sustainability, and intergroup relations, illustrating how education can be effectively leveraged to promote positive societal transformation.  The presentation concludes by outlining future directions for research and policy in this critical field.
