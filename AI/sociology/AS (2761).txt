This presentation examines the pivotal role of education in shaping and transforming social norms across historical periods.  Historically, educational systems have served both to reinforce existing societal structures and to challenge them.  From the ancient Greek emphasis on civic virtue to the Victorian era's focus on moral instruction, curricula have reflected and propagated dominant social norms, impacting everything from gender roles to class hierarchies.  However, education has also been a catalyst for social change.  The rise of progressive education movements, for instance, actively challenged traditional norms by promoting critical thinking, individual expression, and social justice.  This presentation will explore this dual role, analyzing how educational practices – including curriculum content, pedagogical approaches, and institutional structures – have either conserved or altered social norms. We will consider specific case studies, ranging from the dissemination of scientific literacy challenging superstitious beliefs to the influence of compulsory schooling on gender equality.  Ultimately, we argue that education is not merely a passive reflector of society but an active agent in its ongoing construction and evolution, possessing both the potential to perpetuate inequities and the power to foster positive social transformation.
