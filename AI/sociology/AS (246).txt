This presentation examines the experimental challenges inherent in researching the impact of social media on human behavior. While correlational studies readily demonstrate associations between social media use and various outcomes (e.g., anxiety, political polarization), establishing causal relationships remains elusive.  The complex, multifaceted nature of social media platforms presents several methodological hurdles.  Firstly, the difficulty in controlling exposure and establishing baseline measures poses a significant challenge.  Individuals self-select their engagement, leading to confounding variables that obscure the impact of specific platform features or content types.  Secondly, the inherent reactivity of participants to being observed, particularly within online environments, introduces biases that can distort findings.  Thirdly, ethical considerations around data privacy and informed consent must be rigorously addressed when manipulating social media use experimentally.  This presentation will discuss these challenges, focusing on the limitations of current experimental designs (e.g., randomized controlled trials, field experiments) and exploring potential innovative approaches, including the use of  digital trace data analysis and sophisticated statistical techniques to mitigate confounding factors and strengthen causal inferences.  The goal is to highlight the ongoing need for methodological advancements to accurately assess the complex interplay between social media and human behavior.
