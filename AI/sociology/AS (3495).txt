This abstract proposes a novel framework for understanding class inequality through the lens of quantum mechanics.  We posit that societal structures, particularly those perpetuating class divisions, can be modeled as complex, many-body quantum systems.  Individual agents, represented as quasiparticles, interact via potentials reflecting social interactions, influenced by factors such as wealth distribution, access to resources, and social mobility.  These potentials, analogous to electromagnetic or strong nuclear forces, create distinct energy levels corresponding to different socioeconomic strata.  High energy levels represent privileged classes, characterized by reduced entanglement with lower-energy states representing marginalized populations. This limited entanglement restricts social mobility, analogous to a tunneling barrier between energy levels, making transitions between classes improbable.  Furthermore, the system's overall energy, representing societal wellbeing, is demonstrably lower in highly unequal states due to significant energy dissipation through friction-like processes representing social unrest and decreased productivity. We suggest that interventions aimed at increasing entanglement between classes, lowering the energy barriers between strata, and promoting energy redistribution can effectively decrease overall system energy, leading to a more equitable and stable societal state.  Further research utilizing advanced quantum simulation techniques will be crucial to quantitatively explore these relationships.
