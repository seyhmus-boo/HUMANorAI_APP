This presentation explores the multifaceted issue of class inequality and its pervasive effects on society, drawing upon insights from sociology, economics, and political science.  We will argue that class inequality, far from being a solely economic phenomenon, shapes social structures and political processes in profound ways.  Economically, unequal distribution of wealth and resources perpetuates cycles of poverty and limits social mobility, hindering economic growth and exacerbating existing disparities. Sociologically, class inequality manifests in unequal access to education, healthcare, and social networks, reinforcing social stratification and creating distinct cultural capital divides.  Furthermore, from a political science perspective, class inequality can lead to political instability, eroding democratic participation and fostering resentment, potentially fueling social unrest and polarization.  By examining the interwoven nature of these disciplines, this presentation aims to demonstrate the systemic and interconnected nature of class inequality's consequences.  We will highlight the urgent need for interdisciplinary approaches to effectively address this critical social challenge, advocating for policies that promote equitable distribution of resources, improve social mobility, and foster a more inclusive and just society.
