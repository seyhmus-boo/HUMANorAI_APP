The profound influence of education on societal structures and individual behavior has been a subject of ongoing scholarly debate.  Historically, educational systems, from ancient Athenian academies to modern-day mass schooling, have served not merely as repositories of knowledge, but as active agents in shaping social norms and values.  Early forms of education, often confined to elites, reinforced existing hierarchical structures and transmitted dominant ideologies.  However, with the rise of mass education in the 19th and 20th centuries, the potential for education to effect broader societal change became increasingly apparent.  This paper examines the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms, moving beyond a simplistic transmission model to explore its complex and often contradictory influences.  We will investigate how educational institutions, curricula, pedagogical approaches, and the social interactions within educational settings contribute to the internalization and propagation of social norms, encompassing both the reinforcement of existing norms and the fostering of social change.  Furthermore, the paper will consider the potential for education to both perpetuate inequalities and to challenge established power structures, highlighting the critical role of education in negotiating the ever-evolving landscape of social norms.
