This presentation examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change, highlighting the crucial contributions of interdisciplinary research in understanding their dynamics and impact.  While traditionally studied through sociological lenses, a comprehensive analysis necessitates integrating perspectives from political science, history, anthropology, and communication studies.  We argue that a purely sociological approach risks overlooking crucial aspects such as the influence of media framing on movement mobilization (communication studies), the interplay between state power and movement strategies (political science), the historical context shaping movement goals and tactics (history), and the diverse cultural and identity-based formations within movements themselves (anthropology).  This presentation will explore several case studies demonstrating the synergistic potential of an interdisciplinary approach.  Specifically, we will analyze how different disciplinary frameworks illuminate the internal structures, external pressures, and ultimate successes or failures of select movements.  By emphasizing the interconnectedness of these fields, we aim to foster a more nuanced and robust understanding of social movements as powerful agents of societal transformation, and to promote collaborative research that transcends disciplinary boundaries.
