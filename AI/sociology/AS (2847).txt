This presentation explores the role of education in shaping social norms through a novel lens: quantum mechanical principles.  Traditional sociological models often treat norm adoption as a deterministic process. However, we propose a quantum-like approach, highlighting the probabilistic and superpositional nature of individual beliefs and behaviors before societal influence.  Education, in this framework, acts as a "measurement" apparatus, collapsing the superposition of potential norms into a more defined state.  We argue that the curriculum, pedagogical methods, and social interactions within educational settings function as "observables," influencing the probability of adopting specific norms.  Furthermore, entanglement – the interconnectedness of individual beliefs – is crucial, suggesting that educational interventions affecting one individual can ripple through the social network, impacting collective norm adherence.  This quantum-inspired perspective offers a fresh analytical tool, moving beyond simplistic causal models to acknowledge the inherent uncertainty and interconnectedness influencing norm formation and evolution within educational contexts.  We will explore implications for designing educational interventions aimed at fostering prosocial norms and mitigating the transmission of harmful ones.
