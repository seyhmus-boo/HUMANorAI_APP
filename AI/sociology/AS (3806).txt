Social movements, characterized by collective action aimed at achieving social or political change, remain a crucial force shaping societies globally. This paper examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal transformation, analyzing both their successes and limitations within the context of recent developments.  While traditional models often focused on resource mobilization and framing processes, contemporary scholarship increasingly emphasizes the influence of digital technologies, transnational networks, and the complexities of identity politics.  The rise of online activism, exemplified by #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, has fundamentally altered the dynamics of mobilization, enabling rapid information dissemination and cross-border solidarity, yet also presenting challenges concerning authenticity, coordination, and susceptibility to counter-movements.  Furthermore, the increasing fragmentation of social movements, often reflecting intersecting and sometimes conflicting identities, necessitates a nuanced understanding of their internal dynamics and potential for coalition-building.  This research will explore these evolving trends, examining the interplay between offline and online activism, the impact of diverse identity formations, and the enduring power of social movements to challenge established norms and power structures, ultimately contributing to a deeper comprehension of their transformative potential in the 21st century.
