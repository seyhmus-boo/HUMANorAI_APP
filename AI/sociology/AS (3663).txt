This paper investigates the complex relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond simple correlations to explore causal mechanisms.  We argue that while economic growth is often cited as a prerequisite for improved social well-being, the distributional effects of policies are crucial.  Analysis of OECD data across multiple nations reveals a nuanced picture, demonstrating that policies focused solely on macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP growth, often fail to adequately address social inequalities in health, education, and poverty.  Instead, we find a stronger correlation between social well-being and policies that prioritize inclusive growth, including robust social safety nets, investments in human capital, and progressive taxation.  These findings suggest that a holistic approach, integrating social and economic objectives, is essential for effective policymaking.  Practically, our research highlights the need for policymakers to move beyond a singular focus on economic growth and incorporate broader social indicators into policy evaluation.  This includes employing multi-dimensional poverty measures and investing in data collection on social outcomes to ensure equitable distribution of economic gains, ultimately leading to more sustainable and just societies.
