Education plays a crucial role in both reflecting and shaping societal norms. Historically, formal education systems often served to reinforce existing power structures and dominant ideologies, transmitting cultural values and beliefs through curriculum and pedagogy.  For example, during periods of colonialism, education systems frequently promoted assimilation and suppressed indigenous knowledge systems.  Conversely, education can also act as a catalyst for social change.  

The transmission of knowledge within educational settings inherently involves the dissemination of social norms.  Curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and even the social interactions within educational institutions actively cultivate specific behaviours and beliefs, shaping individuals' understanding of acceptable conduct and societal expectations.  Progressive educational reforms, emphasizing critical thinking, social justice, and diverse perspectives, actively challenge established norms and promote the development of more inclusive and equitable societal standards.  Thus, education's impact on social norms is a dynamic interplay between conservation and transformation, constantly shaped by prevailing social, political, and economic contexts.
