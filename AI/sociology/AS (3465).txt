This presentation examines the pervasive and multifaceted nature of class inequality and its detrimental effects on societal well-being.  We argue that class disparities, rooted in unequal access to resources and opportunities, extend far beyond economic stratification, impacting health, education, political participation, and social cohesion.  Drawing upon sociological and economic literature, we analyze the mechanisms through which class inequality perpetuates itself across generations, reinforcing existing power structures and limiting social mobility.  Specifically, we explore the impact of unequal access to quality healthcare, leading to significant health disparities, and the detrimental effects of underfunded education systems on intergenerational social mobility. Furthermore, the presentation considers the political consequences of class inequality, highlighting its contribution to political polarization and decreased civic engagement.  Finally, we discuss potential policy interventions aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of class inequality, emphasizing the need for comprehensive strategies targeting both its structural causes and its individual manifestations.  The presentation concludes by advocating for a multi-pronged approach encompassing progressive taxation, increased investment in public services, and targeted support for vulnerable populations.
