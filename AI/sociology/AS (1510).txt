This paper investigates the complex and multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  While economic growth is often touted as a primary indicator of societal progress, its impact on social well-being is neither uniform nor guaranteed.  This research critically examines the mediating factors that influence the translation of economic policies into tangible improvements in citizens' lives.  We explore a range of policy instruments, including fiscal policies (taxation and expenditure), monetary policies (interest rates and inflation control), and social welfare policies (healthcare, education, and social safety nets), and analyze their respective contributions – or detrimental effects – to various dimensions of social well-being, encompassing health, education, income inequality, and social cohesion.  Through a comparative analysis of different national contexts and utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies, we aim to identify effective policy combinations that foster inclusive and sustainable social well-being. The study challenges the simplistic assumption of a direct correlation between economic growth and social progress, highlighting the crucial role of policy design and implementation in achieving equitable outcomes.
