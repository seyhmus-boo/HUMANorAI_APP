This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, drawing upon interdisciplinary insights from anthropology, sociology, and economics. While globalization fosters interconnectedness and cultural exchange, its effects on local traditions and practices are complex and often contested.  We examine the tension between homogenization, leading to the spread of global cultural products and values, and hybridization, resulting in the creative fusion of global and local elements.  Anthropological studies of cultural appropriation and adaptation will be contrasted with sociological analyses of identity formation in a globalized world.  Furthermore, we will analyze the economic dimensions, considering the influence of global markets on local production, consumption patterns, and the commodification of cultural heritage.  The presentation argues that a nuanced understanding necessitates moving beyond simplistic narratives of either cultural dominance or harmonious coexistence.  By integrating perspectives from diverse disciplines, we aim to illuminate the dynamic interplay between global forces and local resilience, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization for the preservation and transformation of cultural diversity.  The conclusion will propose avenues for fostering more equitable and sustainable intercultural relations in a globally interconnected world.
