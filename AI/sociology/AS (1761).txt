This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, advocating for an interdisciplinary approach to understanding its complexities.  We argue that a singular disciplinary lens is insufficient to capture the nuances of this dynamic interaction.  Drawing on sociological theories of assimilation and multiculturalism, alongside insights from psychology (intergroup relations, prejudice reduction), economics (labor market integration, inequality), and political science (representation, policy effectiveness), we analyze the impact of cultural diversity on social cohesion.  Specifically, we examine how differing levels of cultural homogeneity/heterogeneity correlate with social capital, civic engagement, and perceived social trust.  The presentation will highlight existing research showcasing both the challenges and opportunities presented by diverse societies, focusing on successful integration strategies employed globally.  Furthermore, we will discuss the limitations of current methodologies and propose avenues for future interdisciplinary research, emphasizing the need for collaborative efforts to foster inclusive and equitable societies that effectively harness the potential of cultural diversity.  The ultimate aim is to contribute to evidence-based policy recommendations that promote successful social integration in increasingly diverse communities.
