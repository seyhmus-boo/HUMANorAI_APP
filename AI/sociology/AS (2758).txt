Social media's pervasive influence on human behavior is a subject of growing scholarly interest. This paper theorizes that its impact stems from a complex interplay of psychological and sociological mechanisms.  The affordances of social media – constant connectivity, curated self-presentation, and exposure to vast social networks –  significantly alter social comparison processes, potentially leading to heightened self-esteem concerns, social anxiety, and depression.  Furthermore, the algorithmic curation of content contributes to filter bubbles and echo chambers, reinforcing existing beliefs and limiting exposure to diverse perspectives, which can hinder critical thinking and foster polarization.  The addictive nature of many platforms, driven by reward mechanisms and fear of missing out (FOMO), disrupts attention spans and impacts real-world interactions.  Conversely, social media can facilitate social support, community building, and the mobilization of social movements, demonstrating both its potential for harm and its capacity for positive social change.  Future research should explore the nuanced and context-dependent nature of these impacts, considering factors like age, personality, and platform usage patterns.
