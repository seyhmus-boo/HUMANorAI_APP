Education's influence on social norms is profound, acting not as a simple transmitter of information, but as a powerful sculptor of societal values.  This presentation argues that education operates akin to a gardener cultivating a societal garden.  The "seeds" of norms are pre-existing cultural values and beliefs, but the educational system acts as the soil, providing the environment for their germination and growth.  Curriculum design, teaching methodologies, and the social interactions within educational settings function as the tools of cultivation.  A nurturing environment, rich in critical thinking and empathy (fertile soil), allows for the flourishing of positive norms, such as cooperation and tolerance (healthy plants). Conversely, an environment lacking in these elements (barren soil) may lead to the proliferation of negative norms, such as prejudice and violence (weeds).

Furthermore, the presentation draws an analogy between education and a blacksmith shaping metal.  Raw societal attitudes, analogous to rough iron, are shaped and molded through educational processes.   The "hammer blows" are the lessons, discussions, and experiences encountered within educational institutions.   Through careful and deliberate forging, education can refine societal attitudes, fostering acceptance and understanding, or, through neglect or flawed methodology, may inadvertently reinforce harmful societal structures.  Ultimately, this presentation will explore how a nuanced understanding of education's role as both cultivator and blacksmith is crucial for cultivating a just and equitable society.
