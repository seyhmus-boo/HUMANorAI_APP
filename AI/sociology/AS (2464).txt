This presentation examines the experimental challenges inherent in researching the impact of urbanization on community life.  While the detrimental effects of urban sprawl on social cohesion are frequently posited, empirically testing these claims presents significant methodological hurdles.  We explore these difficulties through the lens of three key challenges: (1) defining and measuring "community" itself within diverse and dynamic urban contexts, acknowledging the limitations of traditional survey methods and the need for more nuanced qualitative approaches; (2) isolating the effects of urbanization from other concurrent socioeconomic factors, such as income inequality and demographic shifts, requiring sophisticated statistical modelling and potentially longitudinal study designs; and (3) establishing causality, moving beyond correlations to demonstrate that specific urban planning decisions or processes directly impact community engagement and social capital.  We argue that addressing these experimental challenges requires interdisciplinary collaborations, innovative data collection techniques (e.g., agent-based modelling, participatory action research), and a careful consideration of ethical implications when studying vulnerable urban populations.  Ultimately, overcoming these methodological obstacles is crucial for developing evidence-based urban policies that foster resilient and vibrant communities.
