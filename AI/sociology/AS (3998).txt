Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, eliciting both homogenization and hybridization. This review examines existing literature exploring this dynamic interplay.  Studies consistently demonstrate the erosion of certain cultural practices and traditions due to the dominance of globalized media, consumerism, and economic forces.  This homogenizing effect is particularly evident in the standardization of languages, food, and fashion.  However, the narrative is not solely one of loss.  Research also highlights the adaptive capacity of local cultures, showcasing instances of cultural hybridization and the emergence of glocalized practicesâ€”the fusion of global and local elements.  This process often results in the reinterpretation and recontextualization of global trends within specific cultural frameworks. While globalization undeniably poses challenges to cultural diversity, the extent of its impact varies significantly across different contexts and communities.  Future research should focus on nuanced analyses that account for the agency of local actors in shaping the interaction between global forces and local cultural identities, moving beyond simplistic narratives of either cultural dominance or resilience.
