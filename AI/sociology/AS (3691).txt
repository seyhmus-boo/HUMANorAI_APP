Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, exerts profound and multifaceted effects on social structures and individual well-being.  While the existence of inequality is widely acknowledged, empirically establishing its precise causal impact remains a significant challenge. This paper explores the methodological hurdles inherent in investigating the societal consequences of class stratification, focusing on the limitations of experimental designs.  Traditional experimental approaches, while offering strong internal validity, often struggle to capture the complex and long-term dynamics of class-based disparities.  Issues of ethical concerns surrounding manipulation of socioeconomic status, the difficulty in achieving random assignment across significant socioeconomic strata, and the inherent complexities of measuring multifaceted outcomes (e.g., social mobility, health, and political engagement) significantly impede the design of robust experiments.  This paper argues that while randomized controlled trials may offer valuable insights into specific mechanisms of inequality's impact, a multi-method approach, incorporating observational studies, longitudinal data analysis, and qualitative methodologies, is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of this pervasive social phenomenon.  We will examine specific examples of experimental attempts to isolate causal effects, highlighting their limitations and proposing avenues for future research employing more nuanced and integrated methodologies.
