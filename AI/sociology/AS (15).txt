This paper investigates the multifaceted role of education in shaping and perpetuating social norms. While the transmission of cultural values has long been recognized as a key function of educational systems, the precise mechanisms through which education influences norm adoption and internalization remain under-explored.  We argue that education acts not only as a direct transmitter of explicit norms through curriculum and pedagogy but also as an indirect shaper of implicit norms through socialization processes within the educational environment.  This study explores this dual role, examining how formal instruction, peer interactions, and the broader school culture contribute to the formation of individual beliefs and behaviors that ultimately reinforce or challenge existing social norms.  Drawing on a theoretical framework that integrates social learning theory, socialization theory, and critical pedagogy, we analyze the interplay between educational structures, institutional practices, and individual agency in norm construction and change.  Our findings suggest a complex relationship, highlighting the potential of education to both reproduce existing inequalities and foster progressive social change, thereby underscoring the crucial need for critically examining educational practices in relation to their societal impact.
