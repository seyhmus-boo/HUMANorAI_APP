Social movements, defined as collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have long been recognized as potent agents of societal change.  However, recent developments necessitate a reassessment of established theoretical frameworks and methodologies for understanding their impact.  This paper examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal transformation, focusing on the evolving relationship between online activism and offline mobilization.  While traditional scholarship emphasized large-scale, geographically concentrated movements, contemporary movements increasingly leverage digital platforms for organization, recruitment, and dissemination of information, blurring the lines between physical and virtual spaces.  This digital turn has presented both opportunities and challenges, influencing the scale, speed, and nature of mobilization, as well as the capacity for state repression and counter-movements.  Furthermore, the rise of transnational networks and the intersectional nature of contemporary social justice movements demand a nuanced understanding of their complex dynamics and varying levels of success in achieving desired societal changes.  This research investigates these recent developments, exploring the implications for established theories of collective action and proposing a framework for analyzing the evolving impact of social movements in the 21st century.
