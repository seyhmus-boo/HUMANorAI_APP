This review examines the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures. While globalization fosters interconnectedness and cultural exchange, its effects on local traditions are complex and often contested.  Studies consistently reveal a significant erosion of unique cultural practices, languages, and artistic expressions as global homogenization pressures increase.  This homogenization is driven by the dominance of global media, consumerism, and transnational corporations, leading to the adoption of Westernized norms and the marginalization of indigenous knowledge systems. However,  a counter-narrative highlights the adaptive capacity of local cultures.  Globalization also facilitates cultural hybridity, resulting in the emergence of new, syncretic cultural forms that blend global and local elements.  Furthermore, globalization can empower local communities through increased access to information and resources, enabling them to revitalize and protect their cultural heritage.  The overall impact, therefore, is not uniform; it varies significantly based on specific cultural contexts, the nature of globalization's influence, and the agency of local communities in resisting or adapting to change.  Future research should focus on nuanced analyses of these dynamic interactions to better understand the enduring legacy of globalization on cultural diversity.
