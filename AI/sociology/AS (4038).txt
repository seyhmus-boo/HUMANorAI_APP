This presentation examines the persistent and evolving nature of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on contemporary society.  Recent developments, including the exacerbated impact of automation and globalization on labor markets, have intensified pre-existing disparities, creating a widening gap between the wealthiest and the most vulnerable. We will analyze how these shifts are manifested in key social indicators, such as health outcomes, educational attainment, and political participation.  The erosion of social mobility, a critical consequence of entrenched inequality, will be discussed in the context of inherited wealth and the increasing concentration of capital.

Furthermore, the presentation will explore the burgeoning literature on the psychological and sociological impacts of inequality, highlighting the links between socioeconomic status and mental health, social trust, and even crime rates.  Recent research on the intergenerational transmission of inequality and its effect on future societal stability will also be addressed. Finally, we will briefly examine emerging policy debates focusing on wealth taxation, universal basic income, and other strategies designed to mitigate the damaging effects of class inequality and foster a more equitable society. The presentation aims to offer a nuanced understanding of this complex issue, emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive and innovative policy solutions.
