Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies throughout history, remains a critical concern demanding rigorous scholarly investigation.  From ancient agrarian civilizations stratified by land ownership to the industrial eraâ€™s stark divisions between capitalists and laborers, disparities in wealth, power, and social status have shaped societal structures and fostered profound consequences.  Historical analyses, ranging from Marx's critique of capitalist exploitation to Weber's multidimensional approach to stratification, have highlighted the persistent and evolving nature of class divisions, emphasizing their entanglement with other axes of inequality such as race and gender.  This paper examines the multifaceted dimensions of class inequality and its pervasive effects on contemporary society.  We will explore the mechanisms through which class inequality perpetuates itself, focusing on its impact on key societal outcomes, including education, healthcare, political participation, and social mobility.  Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex interplay between class stratification and its far-reaching consequences for social cohesion, economic development, and individual well-being.
