The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and historically contingent.  Classical liberal economic thought, dominant from the 18th century, prioritized individual liberty and laissez-faire policies, with social well-being largely considered a byproduct of economic growth.  However, the Industrial Revolution exposed the stark inequalities and social costs of unchecked capitalism, leading to the rise of social democratic thought in the late 19th and 20th centuries.  This ideology advocated for government intervention to mitigate market failures and ensure a more equitable distribution of wealth, fostering social programs like unemployment insurance and universal healthcare.

The Keynesian revolution further emphasized the role of government in managing aggregate demand to achieve full employment and economic stability, implicitly recognizing the impact on social well-being.  However, the stagflation of the 1970s challenged the Keynesian consensus, paving the way for neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and privatization.  While neoliberalism spurred economic growth in some contexts, it also generated increased income inequality and social stratification in many others, prompting renewed debate about the optimal balance between market efficiency and social equity.  Contemporary discussions increasingly focus on measuring well-being beyond GDP, incorporating factors like health, education, and environmental sustainability to understand the multifaceted outcomes of economic policy choices.
