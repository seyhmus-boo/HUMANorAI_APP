Social movements, collective actions aimed at societal transformation, are complex phenomena demanding interdisciplinary analysis.  Their study transcends the boundaries of sociology, drawing significantly from political science, understanding power dynamics and institutional responses; history, examining long-term trajectories of change and contestation; and anthropology, illuminating cultural meanings and the construction of collective identity.  Psychology contributes by exploring the motivations and behaviours of individual activists, while economics sheds light on the resource mobilization strategies employed by these movements.

Effective social movements leverage framing processes, shaping public narratives to garner support.  The interplay between mobilization, framing, and institutional response determines the success or failure of a movement's aims.  Analyzing these interactions requires integrating insights from various disciplines, revealing a nuanced picture of social change.  Thus, interdisciplinarity is not merely desirable but essential for a comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted nature of social movements and their profound impact on shaping societies.
