This presentation examines the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted societal effects, drawing upon insights from sociology, economics, and political science.  We argue that a purely economic lens insufficiently captures the complex interplay of factors driving and perpetuating class disparities.  Focusing on the interdisciplinary connections, we explore how sociological analyses of social mobility, cultural capital, and social stratification intersect with economic indicators like income inequality and wealth distribution.  Furthermore, we investigate the political dimensions of class inequality, examining its influence on policy-making, representation, and the legitimacy of democratic institutions.  By analyzing the cumulative impact of these factors, we demonstrate how class inequality not only exacerbates economic disparities but also contributes to significant social problems, including poor health outcomes, reduced educational attainment, increased crime rates, and diminished social cohesion.  This interdisciplinary approach highlights the urgency of addressing class inequality through comprehensive and multifaceted strategies that transcend traditional disciplinary boundaries. The presentation concludes by suggesting potential avenues for future research and policy interventions informed by this integrated perspective.
