The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has been a central theme in political and economic discourse for centuries.  Historically, laissez-faire capitalism, dominant from the 18th century onwards, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention, often resulting in significant social inequalities and periods of instability.  The devastating consequences of the Great Depression exposed the inherent fragility of this approach, leading to the rise of Keynesian economics and the expansion of the welfare state in the mid-20th century. This shift emphasized government regulation, social safety nets, and active fiscal policy aimed at promoting full employment and reducing income disparities, significantly impacting social well-being metrics like poverty rates and life expectancy.  However, the latter part of the 20th century saw a resurgence of neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation, privatization, and austerity measures, sparking renewed debate about the optimal balance between economic growth and social equity. This research paper examines the multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being, analyzing the impact of different policy approaches across various historical contexts and considering diverse indicators of social well-being beyond purely economic measures.  We aim to contribute to a nuanced understanding of this complex interplay, identifying potential trade-offs and synergies between economic objectives and societal outcomes.
