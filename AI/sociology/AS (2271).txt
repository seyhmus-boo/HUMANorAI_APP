This presentation examines the evolving role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on recent developments in mobilization strategies and their impact. While traditional models emphasized large-scale, centralized movements, contemporary activism displays a marked shift towards decentralized, networked structures facilitated by digital technologies.  We will analyze how these digital platforms, while offering unprecedented reach and mobilization capacity, also present challenges regarding authenticity, coordination, and the potential for fragmentation.  The presentation will explore case studies illustrating both the successes and limitations of this networked activism, contrasting them with more traditional organizational approaches.  Furthermore, we will consider the interplay between online and offline mobilization, examining how digital spaces complement, and sometimes contradict, physical forms of protest and engagement. Finally, the presentation will address the increasing relevance of intersectionality within contemporary social movements, highlighting how the convergence of various social justice issues shapes both their agendas and their effectiveness in achieving systemic change.  The discussion will conclude by considering the future trajectory of social movements in an increasingly interconnected yet polarized world.
