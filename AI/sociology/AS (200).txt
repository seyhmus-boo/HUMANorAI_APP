Social media's pervasive influence on human behavior has become a significant area of research. This review synthesizes existing literature exploring this complex relationship, highlighting both positive and negative impacts.  Studies consistently demonstrate a correlation between social media use and altered self-esteem, body image perception, and mental well-being, particularly among adolescents.  Increased exposure to curated online personas contributes to social comparison and feelings of inadequacy, potentially fostering anxiety and depression. Conversely, social media facilitates social connection, community building, and access to information, potentially fostering social support networks and civic engagement.  However, the spread of misinformation and echo chambers raises concerns about polarization and the erosion of trust in established institutions.  Further research is needed to fully understand the mediating factors influencing these diverse effects, including individual personality traits, usage patterns, and the specific platforms utilized.  Ultimately, a nuanced approach is crucial, acknowledging the dual nature of social media's impact on human behavior and the need for responsible platform design and media literacy initiatives.
