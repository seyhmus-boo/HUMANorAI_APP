Class inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across societal strata, profoundly impacts social cohesion and stability.  Imagine a societal cake: in a society with significant inequality, a small elite consumes the majority of the cake, leaving meager crumbs for the vast population.  This imbalance doesn't simply reflect differing levels of individual effort; rather, it manifests as systemic disadvantages, akin to a rigged race where some runners start far ahead and possess superior equipment. This creates a fertile ground for social unrest, analogous to a pressure cooker where accumulating grievances eventually erupt in protest or violence.  Furthermore, inequality hinders social mobility, resembling a stratified system of rigid social ladders where upward movement is restricted for those born into lower classes.  The resultant concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few can lead to policy decisions that disproportionately benefit the elite, further exacerbating the disparity and creating a self-perpetuating cycle.  Consequently, heightened inequality correlates with decreased public health outcomes, reduced social trust, and diminished overall societal well-being, a scenario akin to a diseased organism where the compromised parts inhibit the overall health of the whole.
