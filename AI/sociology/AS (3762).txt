The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and historically contingent.  Early economic thought, exemplified by laissez-faire capitalism, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention, often neglecting social consequences like widespread poverty and inequality.  This approach, dominant through much of the 19th century, yielded significant wealth creation but at the cost of considerable social stratification and instability, prompting later corrective measures.

The 20th century witnessed a shift towards Keynesian economics, emphasizing government intervention to manage aggregate demand and mitigate economic downturns.  This approach, while contributing to periods of greater social security and reduced inequality in many nations, faced criticisms regarding its potential for inflation and unsustainable debt levels.  Subsequently, neoliberal policies focused on deregulation and privatization, aiming to boost efficiency and competitiveness.  However, this often resulted in increased income inequality and reduced social safety nets, highlighting the ongoing tension between economic efficiency and social equity.  Contemporary discourse increasingly emphasizes the need for policies that balance economic growth with social justice, incorporating measures like progressive taxation, robust social welfare programs, and sustainable environmental practices to foster inclusive and resilient societies.
