This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a simplistic causal link is insufficient to capture their complex interplay.  We propose an ecological analogy:  economic policies are akin to the soil's composition, influencing but not solely determining the health of the ecosystem (social well-being).  Fertile soil (sound economic policies like equitable taxation and robust social safety nets) fosters a thriving ecosystem characterized by reduced inequality, improved health outcomes, and enhanced social cohesion.  Conversely, impoverished soil (neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and austerity) can lead to a degraded ecosystem, manifested in increased poverty, health disparities, and social unrest.  However, the ecosystem's resilience also depends on other factors, such as the climate (existing social structures and cultural norms) and the presence of invasive species (external shocks like pandemics).  Thus, while effective economic policies are essential for social well-being, they operate within a broader context, requiring a nuanced understanding of their interactions with various social, environmental, and political factors. We will illustrate this using examples from different national contexts, highlighting the need for integrated policy approaches that consider the interconnectedness of economic and social spheres.  Ultimately, we advocate for moving beyond simplistic narratives and embracing a more holistic and systems-thinking approach to policymaking.
