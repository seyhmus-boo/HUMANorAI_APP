Class inequality, the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities across societal strata, presents significant challenges to experimental investigation.  While observational studies readily document disparities in health, education, and social mobility correlated with class, establishing causal links proves difficult.  Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard of causal inference, are ethically problematic and practically infeasible when attempting to manipulate class assignment.  Furthermore, the complex interplay of factors contributing to class inequality – encompassing genetics, upbringing, systemic bias, and individual agency – defies simple experimental manipulation.  Endogeneity, where class membership is itself determined by unobserved factors influencing outcomes, presents a major confound.  Even quasi-experimental approaches, like regression discontinuity designs, struggle with the inherent non-randomness of class formation.  Consequently, researchers often rely on instrumental variables or sophisticated statistical modelling to mitigate these challenges, yet the inherent limitations remain a significant obstacle in definitively establishing the causal effects of class inequality on societal well-being.
