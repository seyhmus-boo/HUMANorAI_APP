This presentation explores the multifaceted role of education in shaping and transforming social norms, drawing upon interdisciplinary perspectives from sociology, psychology, and anthropology.  We argue that education acts as a powerful socializing agent, transmitting not only knowledge and skills, but also values, beliefs, and behavioral patterns that underpin societal norms.  The curriculum, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment all contribute to this process, implicitly and explicitly reinforcing existing norms or challenging them through critical pedagogy and inclusive practices.

The presentation will analyze how formal education systems – from primary schooling to higher education – influence the internalization of social norms related to gender, ethnicity, and class.  We will examine the impact of hidden curriculum and informal learning processes within educational settings, alongside the role of extra-curricular activities and peer interactions in shaping social behavior.  Furthermore, we will explore the potential of education to foster positive social change by promoting critical thinking, empathy, and intercultural understanding, thereby challenging discriminatory norms and facilitating the creation of more equitable and inclusive societies.  Finally, we will discuss methodological approaches for researching the complex relationship between education and norm formation.
