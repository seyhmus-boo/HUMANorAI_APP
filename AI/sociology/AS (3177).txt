This paper examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth is insufficient to ensure societal flourishing.  While robust economic performance demonstrably contributes to improved living standards, measured by metrics like GDP per capita and poverty reduction, the distributional effects of economic policies significantly impact social well-being.  Policies promoting equitable income distribution, access to quality healthcare and education, and robust social safety nets are crucial for mitigating inequality and fostering social cohesion. Conversely, policies prioritizing deregulation or austerity measures, while potentially stimulating short-term economic growth, may exacerbate social inequalities and negatively affect mental and physical health outcomes.  Therefore, a holistic approach is advocated, where economic policy is designed not merely to maximize aggregate growth, but to optimize social well-being by considering its impact across diverse segments of the population and addressing social determinants of health and happiness.  Further research is needed to refine empirical models that accurately capture this complex interplay and inform the development of truly socially responsible economic strategies.
