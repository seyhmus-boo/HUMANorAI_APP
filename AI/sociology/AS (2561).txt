Social media's pervasive influence on contemporary society necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its impact on human behavior. This research paper explores the multifaceted consequences of social media engagement, transcending disciplinary boundaries to synthesize insights from sociology, psychology, communication studies, and computer science.  While previous research has often focused on isolated aspects, such as addiction or online harassment, this study adopts an interdisciplinary approach to examine a broader spectrum of behavioral modifications.  We analyze how social media platforms structure social interactions, shaping patterns of communication, information consumption, and identity formation.  Furthermore, we investigate the psychological mechanisms underlying social media usage, including the impact on self-esteem, mental health, and the formation of social comparison biases.  By integrating perspectives from network analysis (computer science), social cognition (psychology), and media effects theory (communication studies), we aim to provide a more nuanced and holistic understanding of the complex relationship between social media and human behavior, highlighting both positive and negative ramifications and offering avenues for future research.
