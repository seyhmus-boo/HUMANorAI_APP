Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, play a crucial role in effecting societal change.  Historically understood through resource mobilization and political process models, contemporary scholarship increasingly emphasizes the significance of framing, identity, and emotional mobilization.  Recent developments highlight the fluidity and interconnectedness of movements, facilitated by digital technologies.  Social media platforms have become pivotal in organizing, disseminating information, and building solidarity, exemplified by the Arab Spring and Black Lives Matter movements.  However, this digital engagement also presents challenges, including the spread of misinformation and the vulnerability to state surveillance and manipulation.  Furthermore, the rise of transnational activism demonstrates the interconnectedness of global issues and the capacity of movements to transcend national boundaries.  Nevertheless, success remains contingent on factors such as internal cohesion, strategic framing, and the ability to navigate complex power dynamics, often leading to varied outcomes, from incremental policy shifts to profound regime change.  Ongoing research emphasizes the importance of intersectionality, acknowledging the overlapping and sometimes conflicting identities and interests within movements, and highlighting the need for inclusive strategies for lasting societal transformation.
