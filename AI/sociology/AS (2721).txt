Class inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across social strata, presents significant societal challenges, particularly in terms of empirical investigation.  While observational studies readily identify correlations between class and outcomes like health, education, and incarceration, establishing causality remains problematic.  The inherent complexity of class, encompassing economic capital, social capital, and cultural capital, makes isolating its independent effects difficult.  Experimental designs, ideally randomized controlled trials, are hampered by ethical and logistical constraints.  Randomly assigning individuals to different class strata is ethically untenable.  Quasi-experimental methods, like regression discontinuity designs, offer partial solutions, but suffer from potential biases stemming from selection mechanisms and unobservable confounders.  Furthermore, the long-term and multigenerational effects of class inequality necessitate longitudinal studies, incurring considerable cost and complicating data collection across cohorts and changing societal contexts.  Consequently, definitively establishing the precise causal mechanisms through which class inequality impacts various societal outcomes remains a significant challenge for social science research.
