This presentation examines the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted societal ramifications, drawing upon insights from sociology, economics, and political science.  We argue that a truly comprehensive understanding necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, moving beyond single-discipline analyses to capture the complex interplay of factors contributing to and resulting from class stratification.  Economically, we will explore the impact of income disparity on social mobility, economic growth, and resource allocation, demonstrating the self-perpetuating nature of inequality.  Sociologically, we will analyze the effects on social cohesion, health outcomes, and educational attainment, highlighting the creation of distinct social spheres with unequal access to opportunities and resources.  From a political science perspective, we will examine the influence of class inequality on political participation, policy-making, and the legitimacy of democratic institutions.  By integrating these perspectives, we aim to showcase how class inequality not only exacerbates existing societal divides but also actively shapes the social, economic, and political landscapes, ultimately hindering progress towards a more equitable and just society.  The presentation will conclude by considering potential policy interventions informed by this interdisciplinary framework.
