This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, moving beyond simple observations to analyze its profound influence on cognitive processes, emotional regulation, and social interactions.  We examine the established link between social media usage and changes in self-esteem, body image, and mental wellbeing, focusing particularly on the role of algorithmic curation and persuasive design in shaping user experience.  The presentation will delve into the burgeoning research on the psychological effects of online comparison, cyberbullying, and the addictive properties of social media platforms.  Furthermore, it will address the implications of social media's influence on political polarization and the spread of misinformation.  Beyond the identification of negative impacts, practical applications of this research will be highlighted, including the development of  evidence-based interventions for mitigating the detrimental effects of social media use.  This includes strategies for promoting digital literacy, developing more ethical algorithm design, and fostering media-critical thinking skills among users. The ultimate aim is to equip individuals and institutions with the knowledge and tools to navigate the complex landscape of social media responsibly and mitigate its potentially harmful consequences.
