While seemingly disparate, quantum mechanics offers a metaphorical framework for understanding the pervasive effects of class inequality within society.  Consider societal stratification as a complex, multi-particle system.  Individuals, analogous to quantum particles, occupy distinct "energy levels" corresponding to their socioeconomic positions.  The inherent probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics mirrors the unpredictable trajectories of individuals within this system; upward mobility, akin to a quantum jump to a higher energy level, remains a probabilistic event, heavily influenced by the overall societal "potential energy landscape" shaped by systemic inequalities.  A high degree of class inequality corresponds to a system with widely separated energy levels, creating a large energy gap that inhibits transitions between classes.  This "energy gap" manifests as limited social mobility, perpetuating cycles of poverty and disadvantage and fostering social instability, mirroring the instability of a system far from equilibrium.  Furthermore, the entanglement of individual fates within this societal system suggests that the actions and circumstances of one "particle" (individual) can profoundly impact the quantum state of others, highlighting the interconnectedness of social problems stemming from class disparities.  Therefore, addressing class inequality requires not only targeting individual outcomes but also reshaping the fundamental "potential energy landscape" of the societal system to allow for greater probability of upward mobility and a more equitable distribution of societal resources, resulting in a more stable and harmonious "quantum state."
