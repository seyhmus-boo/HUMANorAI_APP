Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, continues to exert profound and multifaceted impacts on social structures and individual well-being.  This research paper examines the pervasive influence of class inequality on society, drawing upon an interdisciplinary framework encompassing sociology, economics, political science, and psychology.  While economic disparities represent a primary dimension, this study transcends a purely economic lens to explore the intricate interplay between material inequalities and their broader social consequences. We analyze how class stratification shapes access to resources such as education, healthcare, and justice, ultimately impacting social mobility, political participation, and psychological well-being.  The sociological perspective informs our understanding of the reproduction of inequality through social institutions, while economic analyses illuminate the mechanisms driving wealth accumulation and distribution.  Political science contributes to our understanding of the role of policy and power dynamics in perpetuating or mitigating inequality, and psychological insights reveal the impacts of socioeconomic status on individual health, cognitive development, and social behavior.  By integrating these diverse perspectives, this research aims to provide a nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the multifaceted effects of class inequality on society and to identify potential avenues for promoting greater social equity.
