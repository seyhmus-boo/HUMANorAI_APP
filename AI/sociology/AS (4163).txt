This presentation explores the pivotal role education plays in shaping and reshaping social norms, examining its historical impact and contemporary relevance.  Historically, education systems have often served to reinforce existing power structures and societal norms, transmitting dominant ideologies through curricula and pedagogical approaches.  From the classical Greek emphasis on civic virtue to the Victorian focus on moral character, education has consistently aimed – albeit with varying degrees of success – to instill specific values and behaviors deemed desirable by the ruling class or dominant culture.

However, education has also acted as a catalyst for social change.  Progressive educational movements, advocating for critical thinking and social justice, have challenged traditional norms and empowered marginalized groups.  This presentation will analyze how different educational philosophies and practices – including curriculum content, teaching methodologies, and institutional structures – have either perpetuated or challenged prevailing social norms.  Specific examples will draw upon historical case studies and contemporary research on topics such as gender equality, racial justice, and environmental awareness, highlighting education’s capacity to both reinforce and transform societal expectations and behaviors.  Finally, the presentation will consider the implications for educational policy and practice in fostering inclusive and equitable societies.
