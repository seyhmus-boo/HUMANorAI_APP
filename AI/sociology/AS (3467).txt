Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, transcends disciplinary boundaries, impacting various aspects of human life.  Sociologists analyze its structural roots, revealing how unequal distribution of resources – wealth, power, and prestige – perpetuates a hierarchical social order. This stratification, as economists demonstrate, correlates with disparities in health outcomes, educational attainment, and economic opportunity.  The psychological effects, explored by social psychologists, include increased stress, diminished well-being, and limited social mobility for lower classes.  Furthermore, political scientists highlight the influence of class inequality on political participation and policy-making, where the interests of dominant classes often outweigh those of marginalized groups.  Critically, historical analysis demonstrates the enduring nature of these inequalities, highlighting the cyclical relationship between economic structures and social unrest. Addressing class inequality thus requires an interdisciplinary approach, acknowledging the interwoven social, economic, political, and psychological dimensions of this pervasive issue.
