This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, highlighting crucial interdisciplinary links between psychology, sociology, communication studies, and computer science.  We examine how social media platforms, designed to foster connection, paradoxically influence a range of behaviors, from amplified echo chambers and polarization (political science) to altered self-perception and mental health (psychology).  The presentation will analyze the role of algorithmic curation in shaping information consumption and impacting cognitive biases, drawing on insights from computer science and information studies.  Furthermore, it will investigate the sociological implications of social media's influence on social capital, community formation, and the spread of misinformation, focusing on how online interactions shape offline behavior and relationships. By integrating perspectives from these diverse fields, we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of social media's pervasive and complex effects on individual and collective human behavior, ultimately advocating for a more interdisciplinary approach to both researching and mitigating its potential harms.  This necessitates collaborative efforts across disciplines to address the ethical and societal challenges posed by the increasingly prominent role of social media in contemporary life.
