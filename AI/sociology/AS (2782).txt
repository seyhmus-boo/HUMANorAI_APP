This paper explores the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, emphasizing the crucial need for interdisciplinary perspectives.  While traditional economics focuses on aggregate measures like GDP, a comprehensive understanding necessitates integrating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science.  We examine how specific economic policies – such as taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulations – differentially impact various social groups, considering factors like income inequality, health outcomes, and social cohesion.  Employing a mixed-methods approach, incorporating quantitative analyses of macroeconomic data alongside qualitative studies of lived experiences, we investigate the mediating roles of factors such as access to quality education, healthcare, and social support networks.  Our findings highlight a nuanced relationship, revealing that purely growth-oriented policies can exacerbate social disparities, while targeted interventions focusing on equitable resource distribution and social inclusion are crucial for enhancing overall well-being.  Further interdisciplinary research is needed to refine policy design and evaluation, incorporating longitudinal studies and nuanced perspectives on the complex, dynamic links between economic systems and societal flourishing.
