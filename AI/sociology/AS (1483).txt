Education plays a multifaceted role in shaping and perpetuating social norms.  This paper argues that formal education acts as both a vehicle for transmitting existing norms and a potential catalyst for social change. Through curricula, pedagogical approaches, and the hidden curriculum—the informal learning environment within educational institutions—prevailing societal values and expectations are implicitly and explicitly conveyed to students.  This process contributes to the reproduction of existing social structures and power dynamics.  However, education can also challenge and transform norms. Critical pedagogy, for instance, encourages questioning established power structures and promotes the development of critical consciousness.  Furthermore, exposure to diverse perspectives within educational settings can foster tolerance and challenge ingrained biases.  The effectiveness of education in shaping social norms depends on factors such as the alignment of educational goals with societal aspirations, the agency afforded to students, and the broader socio-political context.  Ultimately, understanding the interplay between education and social norms is crucial for fostering inclusive and equitable societies.
