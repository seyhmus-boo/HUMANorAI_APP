Social media's pervasive influence on human behavior has become a subject of intense scrutiny in recent years, prompting a surge in research across diverse disciplines.  This paper examines the multifaceted impact of social media platforms on individual and collective human behavior, focusing on key developments in the field. While early research primarily concentrated on the effects of social comparison and online self-presentation, recent investigations have shifted towards more nuanced analyses.  This includes exploring the role of algorithmic curation in shaping information consumption and political polarization, the impact of online echo chambers on belief formation, and the burgeoning field of research into social media's effects on mental health and well-being, particularly among adolescents.  Furthermore, advancements in data analytics and computational social science have facilitated more sophisticated methodologies, enabling researchers to investigate complex relationships between social media use, network structure, and behavioral outcomes with greater precision. This paper will review existing literature, highlighting both established findings and emerging trends in this rapidly evolving landscape, ultimately aiming to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of social media's pervasive and often contradictory influence on human behavior.
