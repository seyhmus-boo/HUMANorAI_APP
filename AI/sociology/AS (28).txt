This presentation examines the evolving landscape of gender roles in modern societies, focusing on the methodological challenges inherent in experimentally investigating this complex phenomenon.  While societal shifts towards gender equality are widely observed, quantifying their impact and disentangling the influence of various factors remains a significant hurdle.  Traditional experimental designs, often reliant on controlled environments and simplistic manipulations, struggle to capture the nuanced interplay of individual agency, cultural norms, and structural inequalities that shape gender roles.  We critically analyze existing experimental approaches, highlighting limitations such as artificiality of settings, difficulties in manipulating deeply ingrained beliefs, and ethical considerations surrounding the experimental manipulation of gender identity or expression.  This presentation explores alternative methodologies, including longitudinal studies, field experiments, and the integration of qualitative data, to offer a more robust and nuanced understanding of gender role evolution.  We argue that addressing these methodological challenges is crucial for developing effective interventions aimed at promoting gender equality and achieving a more equitable society.  Finally, we will propose a framework for future research that incorporates interdisciplinary perspectives and addresses ethical considerations throughout the research process.
