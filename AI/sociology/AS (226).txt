This paper investigates the complex relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simplistic correlation to explore nuanced causal pathways.  We argue that the impact of economic policies on social well-being is mediated by several factors, including income inequality, access to healthcare and education, and environmental sustainability.  Analysis of longitudinal data across diverse national contexts reveals that while economic growth, as measured by GDP per capita, is positively correlated with certain aspects of well-being (e.g., life expectancy), this relationship is not consistently linear and often depends heavily on the distributional effects of growth.  Policies prioritizing inclusive growth, such as progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and investment in human capital, demonstrate stronger links to improved social outcomes, including reduced poverty rates, improved health indicators, and increased social cohesion, compared to policies solely focused on maximizing aggregate economic output.  These findings have significant practical applications for policymakers, highlighting the need to shift from a narrow focus on GDP growth towards a more holistic approach that integrates economic and social objectives.  Further research should explore the optimal balance between economic efficiency and social equity to achieve sustainable improvements in social well-being.
