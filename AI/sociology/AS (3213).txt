This presentation explores the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms across historical periods.  Historically, education systems have served as powerful agents of socialization, transmitting dominant cultural values and beliefs across generations.  From ancient Greece's emphasis on civic virtue to the mass education movements of the 19th and 20th centuries, curricula and pedagogical approaches have consistently reflected and reinforced prevailing societal norms, be they religious, political, or economic.  However, this relationship is not unidirectional.  Critical analyses reveal how education can also challenge established norms, fostering social change through the promotion of critical thinking, diverse perspectives, and inclusive pedagogies.  This presentation examines case studies illustrating both the conservative and transformative potential of education.  We will analyze the impact of specific educational policies and practices on the evolution of norms related to gender equality, racial justice, and environmental responsibility.  Finally, we discuss the ongoing challenges and opportunities for education to actively contribute to the development of more equitable and sustainable social norms in the 21st century, considering the influence of globalization and technological advancements.
