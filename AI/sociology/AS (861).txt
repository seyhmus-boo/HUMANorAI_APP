The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has been a central theme in political and economic discourse for centuries.  Historically, laissez-faire economics, dominant from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, prioritized economic growth with minimal government intervention, often resulting in stark inequalities and social unrest.  The Great Depression exposed the inherent fragility of this approach, prompting a shift towards Keynesian economics, which advocated for government intervention to manage aggregate demand and mitigate economic downturns.  This paradigm shift emphasized the social safety net, incorporating policies such as unemployment insurance and social security to improve overall well-being.

However, the latter half of the 20th century saw a resurgence of neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation, privatization, and free markets. While proponents argued these policies stimulated economic growth, critics highlighted increased income inequality and social fragmentation as unintended consequences. This ongoing debate highlights the complex interplay between economic growth, equitable distribution of wealth, and the multifaceted dimensions of social well-being, encompassing health, education, and social inclusion.  This paper will explore this complex relationship, examining the impact of various economic policy approaches on different aspects of social well-being, considering both empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks.
