Education plays a pivotal role in both reflecting and shaping societal norms.  Historically, educational institutions served as agents of socialization, transmitting dominant cultural values and beliefs through curricula and pedagogical practices.  However, recent developments challenge this traditional view.  The rise of critical pedagogy, for instance, actively critiques existing power structures and encourages students to challenge ingrained social norms related to gender, race, and class.  Furthermore, increased access to diverse perspectives through digital technologies and globally connected classrooms exposes students to a wider range of social norms and values, fostering greater understanding and potentially challenging ethnocentric biases.  Simultaneously, the focus on social-emotional learning (SEL) in modern curricula recognizes the importance of cultivating empathy, collaboration, and critical thinking, skills crucial for navigating complex social landscapes and potentially modifying existing norms.  Nevertheless, the influence of education is not monolithic;  socioeconomic disparities often lead to unequal access to quality education and diverse learning environments, perpetuating existing social inequalities and limiting the transformative potential of educational reform.  Therefore, understanding education's complex and multifaceted role requires examining not only its explicit curriculum but also its implicit biases and the broader socio-political context within which it operates.
