This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of contemporary urbanization on community life, focusing on recent developments and shifting trends. While urbanization has historically been associated with economic growth and opportunity, its effects on social cohesion and community wellbeing are complex and often contested.  Recent research highlights a growing disparity between the experience of urban communities based on factors like socioeconomic status and access to resources.  We will explore the implications of intensified residential density on social interaction, examining the role of technology in both facilitating and hindering community building in dense urban environments.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the emergence of new forms of community organization and engagement, particularly those driven by online platforms and digitally-mediated interactions.  Finally, we will analyze the challenges facing urban planners and policymakers in fostering strong, inclusive communities amidst rapid urbanization, focusing on strategies for promoting social equity and enhancing quality of life in urban spaces.  The presentation will conclude by outlining key areas for future research and policy interventions aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization and maximizing its potential for building vibrant and sustainable communities.
