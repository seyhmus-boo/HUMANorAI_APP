This presentation explores the impact of globalization on local cultures through a novel quantum mechanical analogy.  Globalization, we argue, can be conceptualized as a superposition of cultural states, where local traditions exist in a probabilistic blend with globalized influences.  This contrasts with classical, deterministic models which often portray globalization as a simple displacement of local by global.  We posit that the "measurement" – the actual experience and expression of culture – collapses this superposition, leading to a range of outcomes.

The strength of globalization's influence acts as a perturbation, affecting the wave function of cultural identity.  Stronger globalization leads to a more pronounced collapse towards a globalized state, potentially leading to cultural homogenization. However, even under strong perturbation, elements of the initial local state may persist, exhibiting entanglement with globalized elements in a complex, hybridized form.  We examine this entanglement through the lens of quantum decoherence, suggesting that factors like social resilience and cultural preservation efforts affect the rate of decoherence, influencing the longevity of local cultural aspects. This quantum mechanical perspective allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complex and dynamic interplay between globalization and local cultural identities beyond simplistic narratives of either dominance or complete erasure.  The presentation will conclude by discussing avenues for further research using this framework.
