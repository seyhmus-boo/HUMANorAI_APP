This presentation explores the complex and often under-researched relationship between education and the shaping of social norms, focusing on the inherent methodological challenges of experimental design in this area.  While intuitively, education is posited to foster positive social change by disseminating information and promoting critical thinking, empirically establishing a causal link is fraught with difficulties.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard of causal inference, face significant limitations in this context.  Issues include the difficulty in isolating the effect of education from other confounding factors influencing social norms (e.g., peer influence, media exposure, socioeconomic status), the long latency periods before observable shifts in behavior might occur, and the ethical considerations involved in manipulating educational interventions, particularly those concerning sensitive social issues. We will discuss examples of existing experimental studies, highlighting both their successes and limitations. We will argue that a more nuanced approach, incorporating qualitative methods alongside quantitative ones, leveraging naturally occurring variations in educational access, and adopting longitudinal designs, is necessary to accurately assess education's role in shaping social norms and to inform effective interventions.  Finally, we will propose promising avenues for future experimental research that address these methodological challenges.
