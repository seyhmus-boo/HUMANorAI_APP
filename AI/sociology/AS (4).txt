The study of social movements, traditionally rooted in sociological and political science frameworks, has largely neglected the inherently probabilistic and emergent nature of collective action. This paper proposes a novel approach, drawing parallels between the quantum mechanical description of physical systems and the dynamics of social movements.  We posit that the seemingly unpredictable trajectories of social movements, characterized by periods of quiescence punctuated by sudden bursts of activity, mirror the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena. Just as a quantum particle's state is indeterminate until measured, the collective action of a social movement might be considered a superposition of potential outcomes, only collapsing into a definitive state through specific interactions and external stimuli.

This research utilizes concepts from quantum field theory, particularly the notion of emergent properties arising from interactions within a complex system, to model the formation and evolution of social movements. We explore the concept of "social entanglement," arguing that individual actors are not isolated entities but are interconnected through shared beliefs, values, and networks, influencing each other's actions in a manner analogous to entangled quantum particles.  This framework allows for a richer understanding of the unpredictable nature of social change, highlighting the role of critical thresholds, spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the influence of seemingly minor events in triggering large-scale shifts in social dynamics.  The implications of this novel theoretical lens for understanding and predicting societal change will be explored.
