The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is multifaceted and demands an interdisciplinary approach.  While traditionally viewed through an economics lens, focusing solely on GDP growth overlooks crucial social dimensions.  Effective policy requires integrating insights from sociology, which examines inequality's impact on social cohesion and health outcomes, and psychology, which explores the relationship between economic insecurity and mental health.  Furthermore, political science contributes by analyzing the political feasibility and distributional effects of different policies.

For instance, austerity measures, often championed for fiscal responsibility, can negatively impact social well-being by increasing poverty and reducing access to healthcare and education, as demonstrated by sociological studies on the social costs of recession. Conversely, policies prioritizing social safety nets and inclusive growth, informed by psychological understanding of human needs and sociological perspectives on social capital, can foster greater well-being even with modest economic growth.  Ultimately, a holistic understanding, incorporating these diverse perspectives, is crucial for developing policies that promote both economic prosperity and genuine social well-being.
