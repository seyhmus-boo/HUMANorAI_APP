Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies since the Neolithic Revolution, refers to the unequal distribution of resources, power, and opportunities based on social class. Historically, feudal systems rigidly stratified society, with land ownership defining class and perpetuating vast disparities.  The Industrial Revolution, while generating wealth, exacerbated inequality through the emergence of a capitalist class and a large, often exploited, working class.  

Contemporary class inequality manifests in disparities in income, wealth, healthcare access, education, and political influence.  Its effects are far-reaching. High levels of inequality correlate with decreased social mobility, hindering individual potential and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  Furthermore, it undermines social cohesion, fostering resentment, distrust, and potentially social unrest.  Reduced social capital and increased crime rates are often observed in societies with stark class divisions.  Ultimately, persistent class inequality hinders a society's ability to achieve its full economic and social potential, impacting overall well-being and hindering sustainable development.
