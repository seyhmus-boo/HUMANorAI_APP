This paper examines the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, drawing on insights from economics, sociology, and political science.  While traditional economic models often prioritize GDP growth as a proxy for well-being, a multidisciplinary perspective reveals a more nuanced relationship.  We argue that focusing solely on macroeconomic indicators overlooks crucial social determinants of well-being, such as health, education, and social cohesion.  Using a mixed-methods approach, incorporating quantitative analysis of economic data alongside qualitative insights from sociological studies, we explore how specific policies – including taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulations – impact various dimensions of social well-being.  Our findings suggest that policies promoting equitable distribution of wealth and resources, alongside investments in social infrastructure, are strongly correlated with improved population health, reduced inequality, and enhanced social capital.  Further research should explore the causal mechanisms linking specific policy instruments to their social impacts, acknowledging the mediating role of institutional factors and cultural contexts.  Ultimately,  a truly holistic understanding of well-being demands an interdisciplinary approach that integrates economic efficiency with social justice considerations.
