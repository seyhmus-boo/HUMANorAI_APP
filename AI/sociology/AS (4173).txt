Education's influence on society is often compared to a sculptor shaping clay:  the raw material of individual beliefs and behaviours is molded through pedagogical processes to produce a specific societal form.  This paper investigates the crucial role education plays in this sculpting process, specifically its impact on the formation and transformation of social norms.  Just as a blacksmith forges metal into tools with specific functions, education, through curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the subtle influence of the educational environment, shapes individuals' understanding and internalization of societal expectations.  We posit that education acts not only as a passive transmitter of pre-existing norms but also as an active agent in their creation and modification.  This active role can be understood analogously to the gardener who cultivates a specific type of flower â€“ selecting seeds, providing nourishment, and weeding out undesirable elements to foster the growth of desired societal blooms.  Through a critical analysis of existing literature, we explore how various educational approaches influence the adoption and reinforcement of both positive and negative social norms, paying particular attention to the interplay between formal education, informal learning environments, and the broader societal context.
