Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have consistently played a pivotal role in shaping societal landscapes.  This paper examines the multifaceted relationship between social movements and societal change, focusing on recent developments that challenge traditional understandings of mobilization and impact.  While classic theories emphasized resource mobilization and framing processes, contemporary scholarship increasingly acknowledges the influence of digital technologies, transnational networks, and the fragmented nature of contemporary activism.  The rise of online activism, facilitated by social media platforms, has demonstrably altered the dynamics of mobilization, expanding reach and facilitating rapid information dissemination, yet also raising questions about the sustainability and inclusivity of digitally-mediated movements.  Furthermore, the increasing interconnectedness of global social movements through transnational networks presents both opportunities for collaborative action and challenges related to coordinating diverse agendas and overcoming geographical barriers.  This research explores these contemporary nuances, analyzing how digital tools and global networks are reshaping the strategies, impacts, and overall efficacy of social movements in achieving societal transformation.  Ultimately, the paper argues for a nuanced understanding of the evolving relationship between social movements and societal change, accounting for both the successes and limitations of these collective endeavors in the 21st century.
