This presentation examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change.  Moving beyond simplistic notions of success or failure, we analyze the diverse mechanisms through which movements impact societies, considering both intended and unintended consequences.  We argue that the influence of social movements extends beyond achieving specific policy reforms, encompassing broader shifts in public consciousness, discourse framing, and the mobilization of collective action.  The presentation will explore theoretical frameworks, including resource mobilization theory and framing theory, to illuminate the factors contributing to movement efficacy and longevity.  Case studies will be drawn from diverse historical and contemporary movements, highlighting the strategic choices made by activists and the interplay between movement tactics and the broader political context.  Furthermore, we will address the limitations and challenges faced by social movements, such as internal divisions, state repression, and co-optation.  Finally, the presentation will discuss the enduring legacy of social movements, even in instances where their immediate goals remain unrealized, emphasizing their crucial role in shaping long-term societal transformations.
