The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and historically contingent.  Historically, laissez-faire capitalism, dominant from the 18th century onwards, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention. This era witnessed significant wealth creation but also stark inequalities, evidenced by widespread poverty and social unrest, revealing a disconnection between economic expansion and societal welfare.

The 20th century saw a shift towards Keynesian economics, advocating government intervention to manage aggregate demand and mitigate economic downturns. This approach, while achieving periods of prosperity and reduced unemployment, also faced criticisms regarding inflation and inefficient resource allocation.  The subsequent rise of neoliberal policies in the late 20th century emphasized deregulation and privatization, aiming to stimulate growth through market efficiency.  However, this period also saw increased income inequality and a weakening of social safety nets in many countries.

Currently, there's a renewed focus on inclusive growth, recognizing that economic policies must consider their distributive effects.  Social well-being, encompassing factors like health, education, and environmental sustainability, is increasingly acknowledged as a crucial element of successful economic development.  Effective policies thus require a holistic approach, balancing economic efficiency with equitable outcomes and addressing social determinants of well-being.
