This presentation explores the complex and multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being, emphasizing the crucial need for interdisciplinary collaboration in its analysis.  While traditional economics often focuses on aggregate measures like GDP, a holistic understanding necessitates integrating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science.  We argue that purely economically-driven policies, neglecting social factors such as inequality, access to healthcare and education, and community cohesion, can lead to suboptimal social outcomes despite apparent economic growth.  The presentation will examine specific examples, illustrating how policies intended to boost economic efficiency can inadvertently exacerbate social inequalities, impacting mental health, social mobility, and civic engagement.  Conversely, we will showcase cases where socially-oriented policies, though potentially entailing short-term economic trade-offs, have fostered long-term societal benefits.  By drawing upon diverse theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence, we aim to highlight the limitations of purely economic analyses and advocate for a more integrated, interdisciplinary approach to policy formulation that prioritizes both economic prosperity and genuine social well-being.  This integrated approach is crucial for developing sustainable and equitable societal outcomes.
