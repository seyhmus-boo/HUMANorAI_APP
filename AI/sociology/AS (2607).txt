This review examines the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted consequences on societal well-being.  Existing literature consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between socioeconomic disparities and a range of negative social outcomes.  Increased inequality is linked to diminished social mobility, hindering individual advancement and perpetuating intergenerational poverty.  Furthermore, heightened class divisions contribute to increased crime rates, poorer health indicators across multiple dimensions (physical, mental, and reproductive), and reduced social cohesion, manifested in heightened political polarization and social unrest.  Studies exploring the mechanisms underlying these effects highlight the role of unequal access to resources such as quality education, healthcare, and safe housing.  While some research suggests a potential link between moderate inequality and economic growth, the overwhelming consensus points towards a detrimental impact of high levels of inequality on overall societal prosperity and stability.  Further research is needed to fully explore the complex interplay between different forms of inequality and their specific impacts across diverse cultural and historical contexts, particularly focusing on effective policy interventions aimed at reducing class disparities and promoting a more equitable society.
