Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex and multifaceted issue with a long history.  While early forms of cultural exchange existed through trade and migration, the accelerated pace of globalization from the late 20th century onwards has significantly intensified these interactions. This presentation examines the multifaceted effects of this intensified globalization on local cultures, exploring both homogenizing and heterogenizing trends.  Historically, colonialism imposed dominant cultures, creating a legacy of cultural imperialism that continues to shape contemporary power dynamics.  However, globalization also facilitates the spread of local cultures through media, migration, and tourism, leading to hybridity and cultural adaptation.  We will analyze case studies illustrating both the erosion of traditional practices and beliefs – encompassing aspects like language loss and the commodification of cultural heritage – and the emergence of novel cultural forms resulting from intercultural exchange and resistance.  The presentation concludes by considering the implications of these dynamics for cultural preservation, identity formation, and the future of cultural diversity in an increasingly interconnected world.  We argue that a nuanced understanding of both the challenges and opportunities presented by globalization is crucial for fostering sustainable and equitable cultural development.
