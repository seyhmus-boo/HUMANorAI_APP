This presentation explores the complex and often under-researched role of education in shaping social norms, focusing on the inherent experimental challenges in disentangling its influence.  While intuitively, education fosters pro-social behaviors and challenges harmful norms, demonstrating causal links empirically is fraught with difficulties.  This is due to the inherent endogeneity of education â€“ individuals self-select into educational pathways based on pre-existing attitudes and values, confounding the relationship between education and subsequent norm adherence.

Furthermore, the diverse methodologies employed (e.g., observational studies, randomized controlled trials) each present limitations.  Observational studies struggle with omitted variable bias, while randomized controlled trials (RCTs) often face practical constraints like ethical concerns regarding manipulation of educational experiences and difficulties in achieving sufficient power to detect nuanced shifts in social norms.  We discuss these challenges using illustrative examples from research on topics such as gender equality, environmental sustainability, and intergroup relations.  We argue for a more nuanced approach that integrates diverse methodologies and acknowledges the heterogeneity of educational impacts across different contexts and populations, emphasizing the need for longitudinal designs and innovative research strategies to robustly assess the true causal impact of education on social norm formation and change.
