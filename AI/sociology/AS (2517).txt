Social movements, defined as collective actions pursuing shared goals outside established institutional channels, play a crucial role in driving societal change. This paper examines the multifaceted impact of social movements, analyzing their efficacy in achieving policy reforms and shifting dominant societal norms.  While success is contingent upon factors such as resource mobilization, framing strategies, and the political opportunity structure,  movements demonstrably influence public discourse and challenge existing power structures.  Successful movements leverage framing processes to resonate with broader societal values, effectively mobilizing resources and garnering public support.  However, the impact of movements extends beyond immediate policy outcomes. They foster social learning, cultivate collective identity, and contribute to long-term shifts in cultural understandings, even in the absence of immediate legislative success.  Ultimately, understanding the dynamic interplay between movement strategies, political context, and societal responses is critical to assessing their overall contribution to societal transformation. This paper highlights the need for further research exploring the long-term consequences of movement activism and the nuances of their impact across diverse socio-political contexts.
