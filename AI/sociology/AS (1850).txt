This presentation explores the intricate and often contested relationship between economic policies and social well-being, examining its historical evolution and contemporary challenges.  Historically, laissez-faire economics, dominant from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, prioritized economic growth with limited social safety nets, often resulting in significant inequalities and social unrest.  The Great Depression served as a pivotal moment, prompting a shift towards Keynesian interventionism, emphasizing government regulation and social welfare programs to mitigate economic instability and promote full employment.  However, the latter half of the 20th century witnessed the rise of neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation, privatization, and austerity measures, leading to debates about their impact on income inequality, healthcare access, and social mobility.

This presentation will analyze these contrasting approaches, considering their respective successes and failures in fostering social well-being.  It will investigate the multifaceted indicators of social well-being, including health outcomes, education levels, and crime rates, and assess how different economic policy frameworks have influenced these indicators.  Finally, it will discuss contemporary challenges, such as climate change and technological disruption, demanding innovative policy responses that prioritize both economic growth and equitable social outcomes.  The presentation concludes by arguing for a nuanced approach that acknowledges the complex interplay between economic efficiency and social justice in achieving sustainable and inclusive societal progress.
