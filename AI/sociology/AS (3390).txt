While seemingly disparate, quantum mechanics offers a suggestive framework for understanding education's role in shaping social norms.  Social norms, analogous to quantum states, exist as a superposition of potential behaviors until observation (interaction) collapses the wave function.  Education acts as a complex, iterative measurement apparatus.  Formal instruction, mirroring a strong measurement, reinforces specific norms by privileging certain behavioral eigenstates â€“ promoting conformity and reducing uncertainty.  Informal learning, analogous to weak measurements, allows for a gentler perturbation of the wave function, fostering a gradual shift in socially accepted behavior.  The curriculum itself determines the basis states, influencing which norms become readily observable and accessible.  Furthermore, the social environment of the educational setting, including peer interactions, can induce entanglement between individual behavioral states, reinforcing group norms.  Thus, education doesn't simply transmit information; it actively constructs and manipulates the quantum probabilistic landscape of societal behavior, shaping the likelihood of different social norms manifesting in the population.  The effectiveness of this shaping is determined by the strength and nature of the educational 'measurements' employed.
