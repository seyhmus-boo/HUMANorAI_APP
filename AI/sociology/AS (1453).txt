Education plays a crucial role in shaping and reinforcing social norms, acting as both a transmitter of existing values and a catalyst for societal change. Recent research highlights the multifaceted nature of this influence, moving beyond simple transmission models.  Studies employing longitudinal designs demonstrate the enduring impact of educational interventions on attitudes and behaviours related to gender equality, intergroup relations, and environmental sustainability.  Furthermore, the curriculum's content, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school climate significantly impact normative development.  Exposure to diverse perspectives within educational settings fosters cognitive flexibility and reduces prejudice, while participatory learning methodologies empower students to challenge existing norms and actively construct new ones.  However, the effectiveness of education in norm change is contingent upon contextual factors, including socio-economic inequalities and prevailing societal power structures.  Emerging research emphasizes the need for intersectional approaches, acknowledging the interplay of various social identities in shaping educational experiences and their subsequent influence on norm internalization and behavioural outcomes.  Further investigation is warranted to explore the optimal strategies for leveraging education's transformative potential in fostering positive social change.
