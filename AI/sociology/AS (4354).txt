This presentation examines the ongoing evolution of gender roles within contemporary societies, moving beyond simplistic binary models.  We analyze the complex interplay of socio-economic factors, technological advancements, and shifting cultural norms that are reshaping traditional gendered expectations.  The discussion will explore the persistent presence of gender inequalities despite significant progress in areas such as legal rights and educational attainment.  Specifically, we will investigate the impact of globalization and neoliberal policies on the feminization of certain professions and the continued gender pay gap.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the evolving understandings of masculinity and femininity, considering the rise of diverse gender identities and expressions. Using a comparative lens across various national contexts, we will highlight the nuanced ways in which gender roles are negotiated and contested within families, workplaces, and public spheres.  Finally, we will discuss the implications of these shifts for social justice initiatives and future directions in gender research, emphasizing the need for intersectional analyses that account for the complexities of gender in relation to race, class, and sexuality.
