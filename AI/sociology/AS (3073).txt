Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, exerts profound and multifaceted effects across various domains, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding.  This abstract highlights the interconnectedness of economic, social, and health outcomes shaped by class stratification.  Economic inequality, measured through metrics such as the Gini coefficient and wealth distribution, directly correlates with reduced social mobility, limiting opportunities for upward advancement and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  Sociologically, inequality fosters social fragmentation, impacting trust, civic engagement, and collective action.  Criminological studies reveal a strong association between socioeconomic disadvantage and crime rates, both as perpetrators and victims.  Furthermore, epidemiological evidence demonstrates a robust link between class inequality and adverse health outcomes, encompassing increased morbidity, mortality, and reduced life expectancy, partly mediated through stress and access to healthcare.  Interdisciplinary research integrating economic modelling, sociological surveys, and epidemiological analyses is crucial for developing effective policies that address the root causes of inequality and mitigate its far-reaching consequences. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies examining the dynamic interplay between different dimensions of inequality and their impact across the life course.
