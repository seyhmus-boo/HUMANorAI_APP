Good morning. Today's lecture examines social movements through a, perhaps unconventional, quantum mechanical lens.  While seemingly disparate, the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement offer intriguing parallels.  Consider a social movement's inception:  initially, its potential for impact exists in a superposition of states – success and failure are both possibilities, existing simultaneously until measured by societal response.  The initial momentum, much like a particle's wave function, is probabilistic and diffuse.

As the movement gains traction, entanglement comes into play.  Individual actors become interconnected, their actions influencing and reinforcing one another in a non-local manner. This correlated behaviour, reminiscent of entangled particles, amplifies the movement's overall effect, exceeding the sum of individual contributions. The ‘measurement’ – societal response – collapses the wave function, solidifying the movement's outcome.  Whether it collapses into a state of significant societal change or dissipates depends on the interplay of numerous factors, reflecting the inherent uncertainties in quantum systems. Studying these dynamics necessitates a multi-faceted approach, recognizing the inherently probabilistic and entangled nature of collective action in driving social transformation.
