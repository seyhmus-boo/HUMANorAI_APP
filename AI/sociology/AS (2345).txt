Class inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across societal strata, exerts profound and multifaceted effects on social cohesion and well-being.  This lecture examines the pervasive nature of class disparities, highlighting their manifestation in disparities in health outcomes, educational attainment, and political representation.  Empirical evidence consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between lower socioeconomic status and increased vulnerability to chronic illnesses, reduced life expectancy, and limited access to quality healthcare.  Furthermore, class inequality significantly impacts educational achievement, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage through unequal access to resources and opportunities.  This translates to a skewed distribution of power and influence within the political landscape, further entrenching existing inequalities.  The resulting social stratification undermines social capital, fosters resentment and social unrest, and ultimately impedes overall societal progress.  Addressing class inequality requires comprehensive policy interventions targeting education, healthcare, and economic opportunity, aiming to promote social mobility and a more equitable distribution of resources.
