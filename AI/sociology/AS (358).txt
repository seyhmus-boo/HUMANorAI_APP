Class inequality, a persistent societal ill, manifests as a skewed distribution of resources and opportunities across social strata. This disparity exerts profound and multifaceted effects on society, impacting individual well-being and collective progress.  Studies consistently demonstrate a correlation between socioeconomic status and health outcomes, with lower-class individuals experiencing higher rates of morbidity and mortality.  Educational attainment is similarly affected, limiting access to higher education and perpetuating intergenerational inequality.  Furthermore, economic disparities fuel social unrest and political instability, manifesting as increased crime rates and diminished social cohesion.  The concentration of wealth at the top exacerbates these issues, hindering economic mobility and fostering resentment.  Addressing class inequality requires multifaceted interventions targeting education, healthcare, and economic policies aimed at wealth redistribution and the creation of a more equitable society.  Failing to do so risks long-term societal instability and diminished overall well-being.
