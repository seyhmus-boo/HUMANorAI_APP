Education's role in shaping social norms is a complex and historically significant phenomenon.  Historically, formal education systems, often intertwined with religious or state ideologies, actively propagated specific societal values and beliefs.  From ancient Greece's emphasis on civic virtue to the Victorian era's focus on moral instruction, curricula reflected and reinforced prevailing norms.  This process, however, wasn't solely top-down; educational institutions also responded to societal shifts, reflecting changing norms in their pedagogical approaches and subject matter.  

The 20th century saw the rise of critical pedagogy, challenging the passive transmission of norms and advocating for critical engagement with societal structures.  Contemporary scholarship highlights education's capacity both to reproduce existing inequalities and to foster social change.  While the hidden curriculum – the implicit values and behaviors taught indirectly – often reinforces existing power dynamics, deliberate curriculum design can actively promote social justice, tolerance, and inclusive norms.  However, the effectiveness of education in altering deeply entrenched norms remains a subject of ongoing debate, requiring consideration of factors like socioeconomic disparities and cultural contexts.  Ultimately, the relationship between education and social norms is dynamic, multifaceted, and merits continued critical analysis.
