This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, drawing upon insights from anthropology, sociology, and economics.  While globalization fosters interconnectedness and cultural exchange, its effects on local traditions and identities are complex and often contested.  We analyze the tension between homogenization, characterized by the spread of global brands and consumerism, and hybridization, where local cultures adapt and integrate global elements, creating unique syncretic forms.  The economic implications, particularly concerning tourism and international trade, are explored, focusing on both the potential for economic growth and the risks of cultural commodification and exploitation.  Furthermore, we investigate the role of social media and digital technologies in shaping cultural preservation and transmission, examining how these tools can both facilitate the maintenance of local practices and contribute to their erosion.  The presentation will conclude by considering strategies for fostering cultural sustainability in an increasingly globalized world, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration to navigate these intricate dynamics and develop effective preservation policies.
