Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, transcends disciplinary boundaries, impacting various aspects of human life. This presentation explores the multifaceted nature of class inequality and its pervasive effects, drawing on insights from sociology, economics, political science, and psychology.  We will examine how socioeconomic disparities manifest in unequal access to resources, such as education, healthcare, and housing, thereby perpetuating cycles of disadvantage.  The economic consequences, including diminished social mobility and increased wealth concentration, will be analyzed, alongside their political implications, such as reduced political participation and influence for marginalized groups.  Furthermore, the psychological impact of class inequality, including stress, anxiety, and diminished well-being, will be discussed, highlighting the interplay between social structures and individual experiences.  By integrating perspectives from diverse disciplines, this presentation aims to illuminate the complex web of factors contributing to class inequality and its far-reaching societal consequences, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address this critical issue and promote a more equitable society.  Specific examples from contemporary research will be used to illustrate these interconnected dynamics.
