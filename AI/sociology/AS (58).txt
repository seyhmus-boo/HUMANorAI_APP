Urbanization, a defining characteristic of the 21st century, profoundly impacts community life, yielding both positive and negative consequences. This review examines existing literature exploring this complex relationship.  While urbanization offers access to improved infrastructure, employment opportunities, and diverse social networks, it often undermines traditional community structures and social cohesion. Increased population density and anonymity contribute to social isolation and a decline in civic engagement, as evidenced by decreased participation in local initiatives and a weakening of neighborhood ties.  Furthermore, the spatial segregation inherent in many urban landscapes exacerbates existing social inequalities, creating pockets of concentrated disadvantage and limiting opportunities for social interaction across socio-economic strata.  Conversely, urban environments can foster vibrant cultural scenes and diverse perspectives, enriching community life through shared experiences and artistic expression.  Future research should focus on developing strategies to mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization while harnessing its potential to create inclusive and resilient communities, emphasizing the need for participatory urban planning that prioritizes social equity and fosters strong community bonds.
