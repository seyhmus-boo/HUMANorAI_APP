Social movements, collective actions aimed at challenging or maintaining societal power structures, have profoundly shaped historical trajectories.  From abolitionist movements dismantling slavery to the suffrage movement securing women's voting rights, their impact on societal change is undeniable.  Theoretically, these movements operate through various mechanisms, including framing processes which construct shared understandings of grievances and proposed solutions.  Resource mobilization theory highlights the crucial role of access to resources – financial, human, and organizational – in a movement's success.  Political opportunity structures, encompassing the receptiveness of the political system to change, also significantly influence movement outcomes.  Moreover, the interaction between these factors shapes the movement's strategies, from disruptive protests to more institutionalized lobbying.  Ultimately, social movements serve as agents of social change by challenging existing norms, altering public opinion, and pressuring established authorities, ultimately contributing to shifts in policy, law, and social norms, albeit often facing significant opposition and repression.
