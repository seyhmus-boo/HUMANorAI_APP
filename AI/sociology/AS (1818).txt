This presentation examines the complex interplay between cultural diversity and social integration, focusing on recent theoretical and empirical developments.  While increased cultural diversity is often posited as beneficial for innovation and economic growth, its impact on social cohesion remains a subject of ongoing debate.  Recent research highlights the nuanced nature of this relationship, moving beyond simplistic assimilationist models.  We explore the crucial role of inclusive policies and institutional frameworks in fostering successful integration.  Specifically, we analyze recent studies examining the effectiveness of  multiculturalism policies versus integration policies, focusing on their impact on intergroup relations and social trust.  Furthermore, we address the influence of digital technologies and social media on shaping intercultural communication and potential barriers to integration.  Emerging research on the impact of micro-aggressions and subtle forms of discrimination on the lived experiences of minority groups will also be discussed.  Finally, we conclude by highlighting promising avenues for future research, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies that account for the dynamic nature of cultural interaction and the long-term consequences of integration policies.
