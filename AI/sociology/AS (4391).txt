Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, play a crucial role in instigating and shaping societal change.  This paper theorizes their efficacy through a lens integrating resource mobilization and framing perspectives.  Resource mobilization highlights the importance of access to resources – financial, organizational, and human – in determining a movement's success in achieving its objectives.  Framing, conversely, emphasizes the construction of shared meanings and narratives that resonate with potential participants and wider society, thereby influencing public opinion and policy agendas.  The interplay between these elements determines the movement's ability to challenge existing power structures and effect transformative change.  Successful movements demonstrate strategic resource deployment aligned with compelling narratives that frame issues in ways that resonate broadly, thus mobilizing support and exerting pressure on institutions to enact reforms or engender shifts in societal norms and values.  Conversely, failures often stem from resource limitations or ineffective framing that fails to garner widespread support.  Further research should explore the nuanced interactions between these factors in diverse social movement contexts.
