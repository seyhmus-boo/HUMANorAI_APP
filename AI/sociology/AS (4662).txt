This presentation examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a purely growth-focused approach is insufficient for achieving holistic societal progress.  We posit that a robust framework necessitates considering the distributive effects of economic policies alongside aggregate economic indicators.  The analysis will explore the impact of various policy instruments, including taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulations, on key social well-being dimensions such as health, education, and inequality.  Drawing upon empirical evidence from diverse national contexts, we will demonstrate how different policy mixes correlate with variations in social outcomes.  Specifically, we will investigate the efficacy of policies designed to address income inequality, such as progressive taxation and targeted social assistance, in improving overall societal well-being.  Furthermore, the presentation will highlight practical applications, including policy recommendations for achieving a more equitable distribution of resources and promoting inclusive growth.  We conclude by advocating for a more integrated policy approach that explicitly prioritizes social well-being alongside economic growth, ultimately aiming to create a more just and prosperous society.
