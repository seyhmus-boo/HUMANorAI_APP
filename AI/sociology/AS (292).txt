Education has historically played a pivotal role in shaping and reinforcing societal norms, acting as both a transmitter of existing cultural values and a catalyst for social change.  From ancient Greek philosophical schools instilling civic virtue to the medieval church's emphasis on religious dogma, educational institutions have consistently served as agents of socialization, imparting specific beliefs, behaviors, and attitudes considered desirable within a given society.  This transmission often occurs implicitly through the curriculum's framing of historical narratives, the perpetuation of specific literary canons, and the reinforcement of hierarchical structures within the educational system itself.  However, education's influence is not solely conservative.  Progressive educational movements throughout history, from the Enlightenment's emphasis on reason and individual liberty to the 20th-century struggles for civil rights and gender equality, demonstrate education's capacity to challenge established norms.  By promoting critical thinking, fostering empathy, and providing exposure to diverse perspectives, education can empower individuals to question and ultimately reshape societal expectations, leading to positive social transformations.  Thus, the relationship between education and social norms is dynamic and complex, oscillating between the preservation of established order and the promotion of societal evolution.
