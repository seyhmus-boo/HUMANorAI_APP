Education plays a crucial role in both reflecting and shaping societal norms. Historically, educational systems have served to reinforce existing power structures and dominant ideologies.  From the classical Greek emphasis on civic virtue to the Victorian era's focus on moral instruction, curricula have consistently transmitted prevailing social values, implicitly legitimizing them.  This transmission occurs through the explicit teaching of moral codes, legal frameworks, and historical narratives, but also through implicit processes such as the structuring of classrooms and the selection of pedagogical materials.

However, education also acts as a catalyst for social change.  Progressive educational reforms, throughout history, have challenged established norms.  The rise of compulsory education broadened access, potentially challenging existing inequalities.  The inclusion of diverse perspectives in curricula can expose students to alternative viewpoints, fostering critical thinking and potentially leading to the questioning and modification of dominant norms.  Consequently, education operates as a dynamic interplay between the conservation of existing social orders and the generation of transformative social forces, its impact contingent upon the socio-political context in which it functions.
