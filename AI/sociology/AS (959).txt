Class inequality, a persistent societal feature, significantly impacts various dimensions of social life, generating substantial negative externalities.  This paper examines the multifaceted consequences of class stratification, focusing on its effects on health outcomes, educational attainment, and political participation.  Analysis of existing literature reveals a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and health disparities, with lower-class individuals experiencing higher rates of morbidity and mortality due to factors such as limited access to healthcare and increased exposure to environmental hazards.  Educational attainment is demonstrably influenced by class background, with unequal access to quality education perpetuating intergenerational inequalities. Furthermore, class inequality undermines political equality, limiting the political voice and influence of marginalized groups and leading to policies that disproportionately benefit the affluent.  This paper argues that addressing class inequality necessitates comprehensive policy interventions targeting equitable access to resources, including healthcare, education, and fair wages, alongside structural reforms promoting social mobility and inclusive political representation.  Future research should focus on exploring the complex interplay between these factors and developing effective strategies for mitigating the pervasive and damaging effects of class inequality.
