Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, exerts profound and multifaceted effects across various domains, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to its comprehensive understanding.  This abstract highlights the interconnectedness of economic disparities with social, psychological, and health outcomes.  Economic inequality, measured through metrics like the Gini coefficient and wealth distribution, demonstrably correlates with reduced social mobility, limiting opportunities for upward advancement and perpetuating cycles of disadvantage.  Sociological studies reveal its influence on social cohesion, fostering polarization and distrust, while psychological research underscores its contribution to increased stress, anxiety, and mental health disparities across socioeconomic strata.  Furthermore, epidemiological evidence establishes a strong link between class inequality and poorer physical health outcomes, including higher rates of chronic disease and reduced life expectancy.  An interdisciplinary framework, integrating economic modeling, sociological analysis, psychological assessments, and epidemiological data, is crucial for developing effective policy interventions.  Future research should focus on nuanced investigations of mediating factors and the development of targeted strategies to address this complex and pervasive issue, promoting a more equitable and healthier society.
