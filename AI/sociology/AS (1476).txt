This research paper examines the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms, drawing upon insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and educational studies.  While the transmission of knowledge is a primary function of education, its influence extends far beyond the acquisition of facts and skills.  Education acts as a powerful socializing agent, contributing significantly to the internalization and perpetuation – or, conversely, the challenge and transformation – of prevailing societal norms.  This paper investigates how educational institutions, curricula, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school culture collectively impact the development of individual beliefs and behaviours, ultimately influencing the collective norms of a society.  We will explore the mechanisms through which education reinforces existing norms, such as through socialization processes and the implicit curriculum, as well as how it can foster norm change through critical pedagogy, awareness campaigns, and exposure to diverse perspectives. By integrating theoretical frameworks from these disparate disciplines, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of education’s complex and often contradictory impact on the dynamic landscape of social norms.  This interdisciplinary approach is crucial for effectively addressing the societal challenges arising from both the reinforcement and the reformation of social norms within educational contexts.
