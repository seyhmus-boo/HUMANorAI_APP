Cultural diversity, a defining characteristic of increasingly globalized societies, has a complex and multifaceted relationship with social integration.  Historically, periods of significant migration and intercultural contact, such as the post-colonial era and contemporary globalization, have witnessed both heightened social cohesion and increased social fragmentation.  Early assimilationist models, prioritizing the adoption of a dominant culture, have been largely superseded by more nuanced approaches recognizing the value of multiculturalism and intercultural dialogue. This shift reflects a growing understanding that successful social integration is not solely dependent on cultural homogeneity, but rather on the development of inclusive social structures and policies that facilitate intercultural understanding and mutual respect.  However, research indicates that the impact of cultural diversity on social integration varies considerably depending on factors such as the nature of migration flows, pre-existing societal inequalities, and the implementation of effective integration policies.  This abstract underscores the need for further research to identify the optimal conditions for fostering positive intercultural relations and achieving successful social integration within diverse societies, emphasizing the critical role of policy interventions promoting equity and inclusivity.
