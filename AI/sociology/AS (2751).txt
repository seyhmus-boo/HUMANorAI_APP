Class inequality, the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities across social strata, profoundly impacts societal well-being.  This disparity, often stemming from factors like inherited wealth, access to education, and occupational segregation, generates a stratified social structure with significant consequences.  

High levels of inequality correlate with reduced social mobility, limiting individuals' potential based on their birth circumstances. This fosters resentment and social unrest, manifested in higher crime rates and political instability.  Furthermore, inequality negatively impacts public health, with lower-class individuals experiencing higher rates of morbidity and mortality due to limited access to healthcare and healthier lifestyles.  Economically, inequality can stifle aggregate demand, as a large portion of the population lacks sufficient disposable income, hindering overall economic growth.

Practical applications of understanding these effects include designing progressive taxation systems to redistribute wealth, investing in equitable education to improve social mobility, and implementing policies promoting fair employment practices to reduce occupational segregation.  Addressing class inequality requires a multi-faceted approach targeting the root causes and their multifaceted societal repercussions.
