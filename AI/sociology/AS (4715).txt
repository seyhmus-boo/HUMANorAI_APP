This paper investigates the complex and multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  While economic growth is often considered a primary objective of policy, its impact on societal well-being is neither direct nor uniformly positive. This research examines the mediating role of various factors, including income inequality, access to healthcare and education, environmental sustainability, and social safety nets, in determining the overall effect of different economic policy approaches on the well-being of populations.  We analyze the effectiveness of various policy instruments, such as fiscal policies, monetary policies, and regulatory frameworks, across diverse socioeconomic contexts.  The study employs a comparative analysis of selected developed and developing nations, utilizing a mixed-methods approach incorporating quantitative econometric modelling and qualitative case studies to assess the nuances of policy impact.  Our findings contribute to the ongoing debate on the optimal balance between economic growth and social justice, offering insights into the design and implementation of economic policies that effectively promote both economic prosperity and improved social well-being. The implications for policymakers focused on sustainable development and inclusive growth are discussed.
