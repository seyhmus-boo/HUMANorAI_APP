This presentation explores the pivotal role of education in shaping and reshaping societal norms.  While often viewed as a conduit for knowledge transfer, education possesses a more profound influence: it acts as a powerful agent of socialization, impacting individual beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that collectively constitute social norms.  We argue that the curriculum, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment all contribute to this process.  Explicit instruction on topics such as gender equality, environmental sustainability, or civic responsibility can directly challenge existing norms and promote more inclusive and equitable ones.  Conversely, implicit biases embedded within educational materials or practices can inadvertently reinforce harmful stereotypes and existing inequalities.

Practical applications of this understanding are multifaceted.  Curriculum design should prioritize critical thinking skills and incorporate diverse perspectives to challenge dominant narratives.  Teacher training programs must equip educators with the tools to address bias in their teaching and foster inclusive classroom environments.  Moreover, educational interventions targeting specific social issues, such as reducing bullying or promoting healthy relationships, can effectively alter behaviours and shape new social norms.  By acknowledging and actively utilizing its social influence, the education system can play a vital role in fostering positive social change and building a more just and equitable society.
