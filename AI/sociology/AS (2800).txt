This presentation explores the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change.  We will examine how collective action, mobilized around shared grievances and aspirations, challenges existing power structures and initiates transformative processes.  The analysis will draw upon a range of theoretical frameworks, including resource mobilization theory, framing theory, and political process theory, to understand the conditions under which movements emerge, gain momentum, and achieve their objectives.  We will consider both successful and unsuccessful movements, highlighting the crucial interplay between internal movement dynamics, external political context, and the strategic deployment of various tactics.  The practical applications of this research extend to several areas, including the development of effective strategies for social change advocacy, conflict resolution techniques informed by movement dynamics, and the design of policies that foster inclusive and participatory governance.  Specifically, we will illustrate how an understanding of movement mobilization can enhance the efficacy of non-profit organizations, empower marginalized communities, and inform the design of public policy aimed at addressing societal inequalities.  The presentation will conclude by outlining future research directions focused on the evolving role of social movements in the digital age.
