This presentation explores the crucial intersection of sociology and mental health, examining how social structures and processes shape mental well-being and its consequences.  We argue that understanding mental health cannot be solely confined to a biomedical framework; a sociological perspective is essential for comprehending the complex interplay between social inequalities and mental illness prevalence. The presentation will analyze how factors such as socioeconomic status, social support networks, discrimination (e.g., stigma surrounding mental illness), and exposure to adverse social events contribute to mental health disparities across different populations.  We will review existing sociological research demonstrating the correlation between social determinants and conditions like depression, anxiety, and psychosis, highlighting the social construction of mental illness and its implications for diagnosis, treatment, and social policy.  Furthermore, we will discuss the social consequences of mental illness, encompassing issues such as social exclusion, unemployment, and incarceration.  Finally, the presentation will advocate for a more socially just approach to mental health care, emphasizing the importance of addressing social inequalities to promote mental well-being and reduce the burden of mental illness on individuals and society.
