This presentation examines the ongoing evolution of gender roles in modern societies, employing biological and technological analogies to illuminate the complex interplay of biological predispositions and societal constructs.  We can initially conceptualize traditional gender roles as a rigid, pre-programmed operating system, akin to early computer software –  efficient in its simplicity but severely limited in its adaptability.  Biological factors, such as hormonal influences on behavior, can be viewed as the "hardware" underpinning this system, influencing certain tendencies. However, societal shifts, comparable to software updates, are progressively rewriting this "code."  Globalization, technological advancements, and increased access to education act as powerful "drivers," leading to the development of a more flexible, user-friendly "operating system" with diverse configurations.  This, however, isn't a linear progression; rather, it resembles the complex evolution of biological organisms, involving adaptation, mutation, and natural selection.  Resistance to these changes can be likened to "system errors" – entrenched beliefs and practices that slow down the process of societal evolution. The presentation will explore the complexities of this ongoing process, highlighting the interplay between inherent predispositions and dynamic societal influences, and examining the varying trajectories observed across different cultures and contexts.
