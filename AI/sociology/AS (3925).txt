This presentation explores the evolving sociology of mental health, highlighting its historical context and contemporary social implications.  Historically, understandings of mental illness have been profoundly shaped by societal norms, medical advancements, and power dynamics. From early asylums reflecting societal exclusion to the rise of biological psychiatry, the narrative of mental illness has shifted, yet social stigma persists.  We examine how societal factors, such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination, significantly contribute to the prevalence and experience of mental health challenges.  The presentation will analyze the impact of social networks, cultural beliefs, and institutional structures on access to care, treatment efficacy, and overall well-being.  Furthermore, we will discuss the implications of societal attitudes on individualsâ€™ self-perception, help-seeking behaviour, and recovery journeys.  Finally, we will consider contemporary sociological perspectives on mental health, focusing on the growing emphasis on social determinants and the promotion of mental health equity. By understanding the complex interplay between individual experiences and societal forces, we can develop more effective and socially just approaches to mental health care and policy.
