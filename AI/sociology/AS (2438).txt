This paper examines the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simplistic correlation to explore nuanced causal relationships.  We argue that while economic growth is often posited as a prerequisite for enhanced social well-being, the type and distribution of growth are crucial mediating factors.  The analysis utilizes a multi-faceted approach, incorporating quantitative data on various social indicators (e.g., health, education, inequality) alongside qualitative insights derived from case studies of diverse national contexts.  We specifically investigate the impact of fiscal policies (taxation, social spending), monetary policies (interest rates, inflation), and regulatory frameworks (labor market regulations, environmental protection) on key dimensions of social well-being.  Our findings suggest that while certain economic policies, such as progressive taxation and robust social safety nets, demonstrably contribute to improved social well-being, others, like austerity measures, can have detrimental effects, particularly on vulnerable populations.  The paper concludes by emphasizing the need for policy coherence, advocating for a shift towards a more holistic approach that prioritizes equitable growth and the sustainable development of human capabilities as fundamental objectives of economic policy.  This necessitates integrating social impact assessments into policy design and implementation for achieving genuine progress in social well-being.
