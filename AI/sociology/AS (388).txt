Education's role in shaping social norms is akin to a sculptor meticulously chiseling away at a block of marble – the raw material being societal values and pre-existing beliefs.  The curriculum acts as the sculptor's tools, selectively highlighting certain facets of societal expectations while subtly eroding others.  Like a gardener cultivating a specific type of flower, educators nurture desired behaviors through consistent reinforcement, promoting acceptance of specific norms via classroom interaction and extracurricular activities.

However, this process is not without its limitations.  A poorly designed curriculum, analogous to a blunt or flawed tool, may inadvertently perpetuate undesirable norms or fail to address existing inequalities.  Furthermore, the "marble" itself possesses inherent resistance; deeply entrenched cultural beliefs can be remarkably resilient to educational intervention.  Just as a stubborn piece of marble might resist the sculptor's efforts, resistant societal norms can persist despite sustained educational efforts.  Finally, the finished product is not solely determined by the sculptor's skill, but also influenced by external forces –  societal pressures and individual experiences outside the educational setting – acting as environmental factors that might affect the final "shape" of societal norms.  Thus, while education plays a crucial, arguably pivotal role, its impact on shaping social norms is complex and multifaceted.
