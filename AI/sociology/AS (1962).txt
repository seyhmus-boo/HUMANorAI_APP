Social movements, collective actions aimed at challenging or maintaining power structures, are pivotal agents of societal change.  This abstract explores the interdisciplinary nature of understanding their impact, drawing on insights from sociology, political science, history, and psychology.  Sociological perspectives highlight the role of collective identity formation, resource mobilization, and framing processes in movement emergence and success.  Political science contributes by analyzing the strategic interactions between movements and state actors, examining the influence of institutional constraints and opportunities.  Historical analyses provide crucial context, revealing long-term patterns of mobilization and the contingent factors shaping movement outcomes.  Psychological research illuminates the cognitive and emotional processes driving individual participation, emphasizing the influence of social identity, perceived efficacy, and moral outrage.  Integrating these perspectives offers a richer understanding of the complex interplay between movement dynamics, social structures, and broader societal transformations.  Future research should focus on refining multi-method approaches to analyze the long-term consequences of social movements, encompassing both intended and unintended outcomes, and acknowledging the uneven distribution of their effects across different social groups.
