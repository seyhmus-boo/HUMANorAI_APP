This presentation explores the impact of urbanization on community life through a novel lens: the principles of quantum mechanics. While seemingly disparate, the concepts of entanglement and superposition offer intriguing analogies for understanding the complex dynamics of urban communities.  Rapid urbanization leads to a "collapse" of traditional, localized social structures, mirroring the wave function collapse in quantum measurement.  Individual identities, once relatively distinct (separate wave functions), become entangled within the densely populated urban environment, fostering both synergistic interactions and competitive tensions.  This entanglement manifests in the emergence of new collective behaviors –  a superposition of diverse social norms and interactions.  We argue that the superposition principle, representing the co-existence of multiple social realities within the urban fabric, necessitates a nuanced approach to urban planning.  Ignoring the quantum-like complexities of urban social systems leads to inefficient resource allocation and exacerbates social inequalities.  By applying principles of quantum information theory, we propose a framework for analysing the interconnectedness of urban communities and designing interventions that enhance social cohesion and mitigate the negative consequences of rapid urbanization, effectively “measuring” urban systems to promote desired outcomes.  This interdisciplinary approach suggests a fresh perspective for urban studies.
