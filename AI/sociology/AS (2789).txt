This paper explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth alone is insufficient for achieving holistic societal progress.  We posit that effective economic policies must be designed with explicit consideration for their social impact, encompassing dimensions such as health, education, and social equity.  While policies aimed at stimulating economic growth, such as tax cuts or deregulation, can indirectly enhance well-being through increased employment and income, their distributional effects critically shape their overall social impact.  Conversely, policies prioritizing social welfare, like universal basic income or robust social safety nets, can indirectly boost economic productivity by improving human capital and reducing inequality-driven social instability.  The paper proposes a framework for evaluating economic policies through a multi-dimensional lens, incorporating both quantitative economic indicators and qualitative measures of social well-being. This integrated approach necessitates a shift from narrowly defined economic targets towards a more holistic understanding of societal progress, acknowledging the interdependent nature of economic and social factors.
