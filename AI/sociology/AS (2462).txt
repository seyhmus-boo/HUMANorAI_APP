The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has long been a subject of intense debate and research.  This paper explores this complex interplay, moving beyond a purely economic lens to incorporate interdisciplinary perspectives from sociology, political science, and psychology.  While traditional economic models often focus on aggregate indicators like GDP growth, a more holistic understanding necessitates examining the distributional effects of policies and their impact on various dimensions of social well-being, including health, education, and social cohesion.  We argue that neglecting these interdisciplinary links leads to incomplete and potentially misleading analyses of policy effectiveness.  This research investigates how specific economic policies – such as taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulations – differentially affect various societal groups, considering factors such as income inequality, access to resources, and social capital. By drawing upon diverse theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence, we aim to illuminate the mechanisms through which economic choices shape social outcomes, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the policy-well-being nexus and informing the development of more socially equitable and effective economic strategies.
