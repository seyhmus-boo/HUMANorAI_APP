This paper explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth alone is insufficient for achieving holistic societal progress.  We posit that effective economic policies must explicitly consider their distributional impacts and incorporate social indicators beyond GDP per capita.  Specifically, policies aimed at fostering inclusive growth, such as targeted social safety nets, investments in human capital (education and healthcare), and promotion of fair labor practices, are crucial for enhancing social well-being. Conversely, policies prioritizing austerity or unregulated market liberalization, while potentially boosting aggregate economic indicators, may exacerbate inequality and negatively impact the well-being of vulnerable populations. The paper utilizes a theoretical framework combining neo-classical economics with capabilities approaches to analyze this complex interplay. Empirical evidence supporting the proposed model is briefly reviewed, highlighting the need for integrated policy design that prioritizes both economic efficiency and equitable distribution of resources to maximize social well-being.  Future research should focus on developing more robust econometric models that accurately capture the multifaceted nature of this relationship.
