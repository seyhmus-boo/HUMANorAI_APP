This presentation examines the crucial role of social movements in driving societal change, while highlighting inherent methodological challenges in their experimental study.  Traditional social science methodologies often struggle to capture the complex, dynamic, and emergent nature of movement mobilization and impact.  Randomized controlled trials, while providing strong causal inference in other contexts, are frequently impractical or ethically problematic when applied to social movements due to the inherent unpredictability of mobilization and the difficulty of assigning individuals to treatment and control groups in meaningful ways.  This presentation will explore alternative methodological approaches, including comparative case studies, process tracing, and qualitative methods, discussing their strengths and limitations in assessing movement efficacy. We will further examine the challenges of defining and measuring "societal change" itself, arguing that a nuanced understanding requires moving beyond simple outcome measures to encompass shifts in norms, beliefs, and institutional structures.  Finally, the presentation will propose a mixed-methods approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative data to provide a more comprehensive understanding of social movements' contribution to societal transformation, acknowledging the inherent limitations of any single methodology.
