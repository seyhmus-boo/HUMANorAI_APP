Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies throughout history, continues to exert a profound influence on social structures and outcomes.  From ancient agrarian civilizations marked by stark disparities between landowners and laborers, to the feudal systems of medieval Europe with their rigid hierarchical structures, economic stratification has consistently shaped social relations and power dynamics.  The Industrial Revolution, while fostering unprecedented economic growth, simultaneously exacerbated existing inequalities, creating a burgeoning capitalist class alongside a vast, impoverished working class.  This period witnessed the rise of sociological inquiry into class, with thinkers like Marx and Weber offering competing yet influential frameworks for understanding its genesis and impact.

Despite significant shifts in economic organization and welfare provision throughout the 20th century, class inequality remains a pervasive global challenge.  This paper examines the multifaceted effects of class inequality on contemporary societies, exploring its influence on areas such as health outcomes, educational attainment, political participation, and social mobility.  By drawing upon existing sociological and economic literature, we will analyze the mechanisms through which class disparities perpetuate themselves and contribute to broader societal instability and injustice.  The paper will ultimately argue that addressing class inequality requires a multifaceted approach encompassing both structural reforms and policy interventions targeting the root causes of this enduring social problem.
