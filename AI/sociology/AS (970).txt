Education's role in shaping social norms is a multifaceted process with deep historical roots.  Historically, formal education systems, often intertwined with religious or political agendas, actively propagated specific norms and values.  From the ancient Greek emphasis on civic virtue to the Victorian era's focus on moral instruction, schools served as crucial agents of socialization, transmitting dominant ideologies and reinforcing societal hierarchies.  This process was often implicit, woven into the curriculum and pedagogical practices, rather than explicitly stated.

However, the 20th and 21st centuries have witnessed a shift towards a more critical understanding of education's influence.  The rise of critical pedagogy and social constructivist theory highlighted the inherent power dynamics within educational settings and the potential for education to both perpetuate and challenge existing social norms.  Contemporary research explores how curriculum design, teacher-student interactions, and peer dynamics shape students' beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors, impacting norms around gender, race, class, and sexuality.  While education can reinforce existing inequalities, it also possesses the capacity to promote social justice and challenge discriminatory norms through inclusive curricula and critical pedagogical approaches.  Therefore, understanding education's role necessitates analyzing its complex interplay with power, culture, and social change.
