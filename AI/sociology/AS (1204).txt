The evolution of gender roles in modern societies is a complex process, far from a linear progression.  Initially, rigid, biologically-determined roles, akin to the fixed functions of cogs in a clockwork mechanism, dominated social structures.  Men were primarily associated with public life and physical labor, analogous to the engine powering the clock, while women's roles were confined to the domestic sphere, resembling the delicate internal mechanisms regulating its timing.  However, societal shifts, particularly post-industrialization and increased access to education, have begun to dismantle this rigid structure.  The industrial revolution, comparable to a technological upgrade in the clock's design, necessitated a shift in labor demands, gradually blurring the lines between traditionally masculine and feminine occupations.  The feminist movement, acting as a significant recalibration of the clock's gears, further challenged the existing power dynamics, advocating for equitable access to education, employment, and political participation.  Though progress has been considerable, gender roles remain a fluid and contested landscape.  The current state can be likened to a clock undergoing extensive repair; some parts are fully modernized, while others retain vestiges of the old mechanism, leading to ongoing negotiations and renegotiations of gender expectations.
