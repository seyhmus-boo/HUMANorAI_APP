Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, exerts profound and multifaceted effects across various domains, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding. This abstract explores the interconnectedness of economic disparities with social, psychological, and political outcomes.  Economically disadvantaged groups experience compromised health outcomes, including higher rates of chronic disease and lower life expectancy, reflecting the interplay of socioeconomic status and access to healthcare (epidemiology, public health).  Educational attainment is strongly correlated with social class, perpetuating inequality across generations (sociology, education).  Moreover, political disenfranchisement and reduced civic engagement are observed among lower socioeconomic strata, influencing policy outcomes and reinforcing existing inequalities (political science, sociology). Psychological research demonstrates the impact of socioeconomic disadvantage on mental health, stress levels, and cognitive function, further exacerbating existing societal challenges (psychology).  An integrated framework incorporating insights from these diverse disciplines is essential for developing effective interventions to mitigate the detrimental consequences of class inequality and promote a more equitable society.  Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies investigating the complex interplay of these factors and the development of nuanced, context-specific solutions.
