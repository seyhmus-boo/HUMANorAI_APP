The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and historically contingent.  Early laissez-faire capitalism, while fostering economic growth in certain sectors, frequently neglected social welfare, resulting in widespread poverty and inequality, as exemplified by the Industrial Revolution's stark social disparities.  The subsequent rise of social democracy in the 20th century saw a shift towards interventionist policies, with governments actively managing economies to achieve greater social equity through welfare programs, progressive taxation, and labor protections.  The Keynesian revolution significantly influenced this approach, advocating for government spending to mitigate economic downturns and stabilize employment, thereby indirectly bolstering social well-being.

However, the latter half of the 20th century witnessed a resurgence of neoliberal economic policies emphasizing deregulation, privatization, and free market principles. While proponents argued these policies stimulated economic growth, critics contend they exacerbated inequality and undermined social safety nets.  The ongoing debate centers on the optimal balance between economic efficiency and social justice.  Empirical evidence suggests a positive correlation between certain economic indicators (e.g., GDP per capita) and measures of well-being, but this relationship is not linear and varies across contexts, highlighting the importance of considering factors such as income distribution and access to essential services in assessing the true impact of economic policies on social well-being.
