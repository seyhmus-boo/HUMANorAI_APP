Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to fully understand its multifaceted effects. This abstract highlights the interconnectedness of economic, sociological, and psychological factors shaping and being shaped by class disparities.  Economically, unequal distribution of wealth and resources exacerbates income gaps, limiting social mobility and perpetuating cycles of poverty. Sociologically, class distinctions manifest in disparate access to education, healthcare, and political influence, leading to stratified social networks and power imbalances.  This inequality is further compounded by psychological impacts, including stress, anxiety, and reduced life expectancy associated with lower socioeconomic status, impacting both individual well-being and societal productivity.  Interdisciplinary research leveraging economic modeling, sociological surveys, and psychological assessments is crucial to unravel the complex interplay between these factors.  A holistic understanding requires analyzing the impact of class inequality not just on individual outcomes but also on broader societal phenomena such as crime rates, public health, and political stability. Ultimately, addressing class inequality demands integrated policy interventions targeting economic redistribution, social equity, and improved mental health resources.
