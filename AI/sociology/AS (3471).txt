This presentation explores the evolving sociological understanding of mental health and its profound social implications.  Historically, societal attitudes towards mental illness have oscillated between demonization and medicalization, shaping treatment approaches and the lived experiences of individuals.  From early asylums reflecting societal anxieties about deviance, to the rise of the biomedical model in the 20th century, societal structures have profoundly influenced the diagnosis, treatment, and social integration of those with mental health conditions.

This presentation will examine key sociological perspectives, including labeling theory, which highlights the role of social interaction in shaping the construction of mental illness, and the social determinants of health framework, which emphasizes the influence of socioeconomic factors, social inequality, and discrimination on mental health outcomes.  Further, we will discuss the social implications of stigma, highlighting its impact on access to care, employment, and social relationships.  Finally,  the presentation will touch upon emerging research exploring the role of social support networks, community-based interventions, and social justice initiatives in promoting mental well-being and reducing health disparities. By critically examining the interplay between societal structures and individual experiences, this presentation aims to stimulate discussion on effective strategies for fostering mental health equity and social inclusion.
