This presentation explores the complex and often under-researched relationship between education and the shaping of social norms, highlighting significant experimental challenges. While intuitively, education is expected to promote prosocial behaviours and challenge harmful norms, empirical evidence reveals a nuanced reality.  We discuss the difficulties in isolating the effect of education from other confounding factors, such as socioeconomic status and pre-existing beliefs, which often correlate strongly with educational attainment.  Furthermore, the diverse nature of educational settings and curricula complicates establishing causal links between specific educational interventions and shifts in social norms.  We critically examine existing experimental designs, including randomized controlled trials and quasi-experimental studies,  analyzing their strengths and limitations in addressing these challenges.  Finally, we propose methodological advancements, such as the use of natural experiments and advanced statistical techniques to mitigate confounding factors and improve the precision of causal inferences. The goal is to foster a more rigorous understanding of education's role in norm transformation, leading to more effective educational strategies for positive social change.
