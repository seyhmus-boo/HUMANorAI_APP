Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, significantly impacts various aspects of social well-being and collective outcomes. This abstract examines the multifaceted consequences of class stratification, drawing upon existing sociological and economic literature.  We argue that unequal distribution of resources, including wealth, income, and access to quality education and healthcare, perpetuates a cycle of disadvantage across generations.  This inequality manifests in disparities in health outcomes, life expectancy, and educational attainment, contributing to social instability and reduced overall societal productivity.  Furthermore, high levels of class inequality are correlated with increased crime rates, political polarization, and reduced social mobility.  Existing research highlights the detrimental effects on social cohesion, manifested in increased social stratification, reduced trust, and heightened levels of intergroup conflict.  Addressing class inequality necessitates multi-faceted interventions targeting wealth redistribution, improved access to education and healthcare, and policies promoting social mobility.  Future research should focus on the specific mechanisms through which class inequality impacts social outcomes and the effectiveness of various policy interventions designed to mitigate its negative consequences.
