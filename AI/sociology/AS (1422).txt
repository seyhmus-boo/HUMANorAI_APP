This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being, highlighting the critical need for interdisciplinary approaches to fully understand and address its complexities. While traditional economics often prioritizes GDP growth, a more holistic perspective necessitates incorporating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science.  We argue that narrowly focused economic policies, such as austerity measures or unfettered deregulation, can negatively impact social well-being, manifesting in increased inequality, social unrest, and diminished mental health outcomes.  Conversely, policies prioritizing social inclusion, equitable resource distribution, and robust social safety nets, though potentially impacting short-term economic indicators, can foster long-term social stability and improved overall well-being. This presentation utilizes a mixed-methods approach, drawing upon quantitative data on economic indicators and qualitative analysis of societal impacts to illustrate the intricate interplay between economic choices and social consequences.  We will examine case studies demonstrating the successes and failures of different policy approaches, emphasizing the crucial role of interdisciplinary collaboration in crafting effective and ethically sound economic policies that genuinely promote social well-being. Finally, we will discuss potential avenues for future research and policy recommendations to strengthen the link between economic growth and societal flourishing.
