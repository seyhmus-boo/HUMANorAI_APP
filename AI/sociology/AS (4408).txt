This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, moving beyond simplistic narratives of homogenization or resistance.  We argue that globalization fosters a complex interplay between cultural diffusion, adaptation, and hybridization.  Drawing upon case studies from diverse geographical contexts, we analyze the mechanisms through which global flows of information, goods, and people influence local traditions, practices, and identities.  The analysis considers both the potential erosion of unique cultural elements through processes like cultural appropriation and the emergence of novel hybrid forms synthesizing global and local influences.  

Our framework identifies key factors mediating the impact of globalization, such as the pre-existing strength of local cultural institutions, levels of economic integration, and the agency of local communities in shaping global influences.  Practical applications of this research include informing culturally sensitive development strategies, promoting responsible tourism initiatives, and developing effective intercultural communication frameworks. By understanding the nuanced dynamics between globalization and local culture, we can better support sustainable development that respects and strengthens cultural diversity while harnessing the opportunities presented by global interconnectedness.  The presentation concludes by outlining avenues for future research exploring the long-term consequences of these complex intercultural interactions.
