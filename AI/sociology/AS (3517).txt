The literature extensively documents class inequality and its deleterious societal effects, yet experimental investigation of its mechanisms remains challenging.  Studies attempting to isolate the impact of class on specific outcomes often grapple with confounding variables, particularly pre-existing individual differences in ability, motivation, and social capital.  Randomized controlled trials, while offering the strongest causal inference, are hampered by ethical and practical limitations in manipulating class status directly.  Observational studies, though more feasible, are susceptible to selection bias and endogeneity issues, making it difficult to disentangle the independent effects of class from other correlated factors.

Further complicating matters is the multidimensional nature of class, encompassing economic resources, social status, and cultural capital.  Measuring these dimensions comprehensively and operationalizing them in experimental designs presents significant methodological hurdles.  Furthermore, the long-term consequences of class inequality are often difficult to capture within the timeframe of most experimental studies.  Overcoming these limitations requires innovative research designs, such as integrating longitudinal data, employing sophisticated statistical techniques to control for confounding factors, and developing more nuanced measures of class and its various facets.  Ultimately, advancing our understanding of class inequality necessitates a multi-method approach combining experimental designs with rigorous observational studies.
