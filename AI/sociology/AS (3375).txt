This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary perspectives needed for a comprehensive understanding.  While increasing cultural diversity offers enriching opportunities for innovation and societal growth, its impact on social cohesion remains a complex and contested issue.  We argue that a solely sociological lens is insufficient to fully grasp this dynamic.  Therefore, this presentation integrates insights from psychology (examining intergroup relations and prejudice reduction), economics (analyzing the impact of diversity on economic outcomes and inequality), and political science (investigating the role of policy in fostering inclusive citizenship).  By drawing upon these disciplines, we analyze how factors such as communication styles, socioeconomic disparities, and political representation shape the integration process.  We will further discuss the challenges posed by cultural misunderstandings, discrimination, and the potential for social fragmentation, offering evidence-based recommendations for fostering inclusive societies that celebrate diversity while simultaneously promoting social harmony and equity. The presentation concludes by advocating for a more holistic, interdisciplinary approach to research and policy-making in this critical area.
