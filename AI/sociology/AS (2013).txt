Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and perpetuating, or challenging and transforming, social norms.  Its influence transcends the purely cognitive, extending into the affective and behavioral domains.  Sociological perspectives highlight how educational institutions, through curricula, pedagogy, and hidden curricula, socialize individuals into existing power structures and norms.  This process, analyzed through functionalist and conflict theories, reveals how education can both reinforce societal inequalities and provide avenues for social mobility, contingent on the dominant ideologies embedded within the system.

Anthropological studies further illuminate this complex interplay, emphasizing the role of education in transmitting cultural values and beliefs across generations.  However, the transmission is not passive; critical pedagogy, drawing on philosophies of education and psychology, underscores the agency of learners in negotiating and potentially resisting dominant norms.  Furthermore, psychological research on social cognition and conformity demonstrates how educational environments can cultivate both conformity and critical thinking, impacting individuals' ability to challenge or accept prevailing social expectations.  Interdisciplinary investigation into the interplay of these fields is crucial for understanding the nuanced relationship between education and the dynamic evolution of social norms.
