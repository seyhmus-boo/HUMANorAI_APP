Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, play a significant role in driving societal change.  This paper examines the mechanisms through which movements effect transformative change, analyzing their influence on policy, norms, and collective identity.  We posit that movement success hinges on several interconnected factors, including resource mobilization, framing strategies, and the strategic adoption of contentious tactics.  Analysis of historical and contemporary case studies reveals a complex interplay between movement agency and structural opportunities. While successful movements often leverage existing fault lines in power structures and societal norms, their impact is not solely determined by pre-existing conditions;  innovative framing and strategic mobilization can significantly shape the trajectory of societal change.  Further, we explore the concept of "spillover effects," where movement-induced changes in one domain ripple outwards to impact other social spheres.  Our findings emphasize the crucial role of social movements as agents of both incremental and transformative societal shifts, underscoring the need for interdisciplinary research to fully understand their complex dynamics and long-term consequences.
