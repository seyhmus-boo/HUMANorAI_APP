This paper examines the multifaceted role of education in shaping and perpetuating social norms.  While often viewed as a neutral conveyor of knowledge, education systems actively participate in the socialization process, transmitting cultural values, beliefs, and behavioral expectations through both formal curricula and informal interactions. We argue that education's influence extends beyond the explicit transmission of information, impacting the development of individual identities, social attitudes, and ultimately, the reproduction or challenge of prevailing social norms. This research explores this complex interplay through a critical analysis of existing literature, focusing on three key aspects: the curriculum's explicit and implicit messaging regarding societal expectations; the influence of pedagogical approaches and school culture on the internalization of norms; and the role of education in fostering critical thinking and potentially challenging dominant social paradigms.  We propose a framework for understanding how different educational structures and approaches differentially contribute to the reinforcement or transformation of social norms, offering implications for educational policy and practice aimed at promoting social equity and positive societal change.  The study contributes to ongoing discussions concerning the social function of education and its potential to address societal inequalities through norm transformation.
