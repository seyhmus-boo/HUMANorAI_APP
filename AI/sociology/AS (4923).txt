Education plays a crucial role in shaping social norms, acting as a powerful agent of socialization and influencing individual attitudes and behaviors.  Recent research highlights the nuanced and multifaceted nature of this influence, moving beyond simple transmission models.  Studies employing longitudinal designs and utilizing diverse methodologies, including experimental interventions and network analysis, demonstrate education's impact extends beyond the acquisition of knowledge to the internalization of values and beliefs.  For instance, higher levels of education are consistently associated with increased support for gender equality and environmental protection, reflecting the adoption of progressive social norms.  However, the effectiveness of education in shaping norms depends on curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the broader socio-cultural context.  Emerging research emphasizes the importance of critical thinking skills and participatory learning in fostering internalized norm change, rather than mere compliance.  Furthermore, investigations into the role of educational institutions in perpetuating existing inequalities highlight the need for inclusive curricula that actively challenge discriminatory norms.  Future research should focus on understanding the interplay between educational interventions, individual agency, and broader societal changes to optimize education's role in promoting positive social norms and reducing societal inequalities.
