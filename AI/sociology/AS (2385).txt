Social movements, defined as collective actions aimed at challenging existing power structures and promoting societal change, play a crucial role in reshaping norms, values, and institutions.  Their efficacy stems from the mobilization of resources – both material (funding, infrastructure) and symbolic (narratives, identity formation) – to influence public opinion and pressure decision-makers. Recent developments highlight a shift towards decentralized, networked mobilization facilitated by digital technologies.  Social media platforms empower rapid information dissemination, circumventing traditional gatekeepers and fostering cross-border solidarity, as evidenced by the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements.

However, digitalization also presents challenges.  Online echo chambers can reinforce existing biases, hindering productive dialogue and potentially leading to polarization.  Furthermore, the ephemerality of online activism requires sustained engagement to translate virtual mobilization into tangible policy change.  Contemporary research emphasizes the hybrid nature of modern movements, combining online and offline strategies to maximize impact. Analyzing the interplay between digital technologies and traditional organizational structures is crucial to understanding the evolving dynamics of social movements and their continued potential for driving societal transformation.
