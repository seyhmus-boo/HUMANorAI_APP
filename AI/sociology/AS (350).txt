Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, exerts profound and multifaceted effects across various social domains.  This presentation examines the experimental difficulties inherent in studying its impact.  While observational studies offer valuable insights, establishing causal links between class inequality and outcomes like health, education, and social mobility remains fraught with methodological hurdles.  We will explore the challenges posed by the inherent complexity of class, encompassing economic, social, and cultural dimensions, and the difficulty in isolating its specific effects from confounding variables such as individual agency and geographic location.  Furthermore, ethical considerations surrounding experimental manipulation of class-related variables, such as income or access to resources, present significant constraints.  The presentation will discuss the potential of novel experimental designs, including natural experiments and quasi-experimental approaches, alongside the limitations of these methods.  Finally, we will argue for a multi-method approach, combining experimental findings with qualitative and quantitative data, to provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of class inequality's impact on societal well-being.
