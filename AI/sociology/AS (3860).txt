Social norms, the unwritten rules governing behavior within a society, are crucial determinants of individual actions and societal outcomes.  While numerous factors influence their formation and evolution, the role of education remains under-explored, particularly regarding its nuanced impact beyond the mere transmission of knowledge. This paper investigates the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms, moving beyond a simplistic transmission model to explore its influence on critical thinking, values development, and social interaction.  We posit that education acts not only as a conveyor of existing norms but also as a crucial platform for their negotiation, contestation, and potential transformation.  Our analysis draws upon a theoretical framework that integrates sociological perspectives on socialization with cognitive developmental theories of learning and moral reasoning. We examine empirical evidence from diverse educational settings and across various social contexts to analyze the impact of different educational approaches – formal and informal, curriculum content, and pedagogical methods – on the internalization and modification of social norms.  The paper concludes by discussing the implications of our findings for educational policy and practice aimed at fostering socially responsible and ethically informed citizenry.
