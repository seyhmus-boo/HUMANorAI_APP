Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, manifests as disparities in wealth, power, and social status, profoundly impacting societal structures and individual life chances.  Historically, feudal systems exemplified stark class divisions, with rigid hierarchies determining access to resources and opportunities.  The Industrial Revolution exacerbated inequality, creating a burgeoning capitalist class alongside a vast, exploited proletariat.  While the 20th century saw the rise of welfare states aimed at mitigating inequality through social programs and progressive taxation, significant disparities remain.

Contemporary class inequality is fuelled by factors like globalization, technological advancements, and regressive tax policies.  Its effects are multifaceted.  Economically, it hinders social mobility, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting overall economic growth.  Socially, it contributes to increased crime rates, poor health outcomes, and diminished social cohesion, fostering resentment and political instability.  Politically, concentrated wealth can translate into disproportionate influence, undermining democratic processes and furthering the interests of dominant classes.  Addressing class inequality requires multi-pronged strategies, including progressive taxation, investment in education and healthcare, and policies promoting fair labor practices, ultimately aiming for a more equitable and just society.
