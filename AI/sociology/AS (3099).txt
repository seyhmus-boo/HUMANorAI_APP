Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, continues to exert profound and multifaceted effects on social structures and individual well-being.  This research paper explores the pervasive influence of class inequality, moving beyond a purely economic lens to examine its ramifications across diverse disciplines.  We argue that a truly comprehensive understanding requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating insights from sociology, economics, political science, and psychology to unravel the complex web of causal relationships.  Economic disparities, typically measured through income and wealth distribution, are examined not merely as a source of material hardship, but as a generator of social stratification impacting access to education, healthcare, and political participation (Sociology). This unequal distribution of resources shapes political power dynamics, influencing policy decisions and reinforcing existing inequalities (Political Science). Furthermore, the psychological impact of class disparities, including stress, anxiety, and diminished life opportunities, cannot be ignored (Psychology).  By synthesizing these perspectives, this paper aims to offer a more nuanced understanding of the mechanisms through which class inequality perpetuates itself and its devastating consequences for societal cohesion and progress.  Ultimately, we seek to illuminate the urgent need for multi-pronged policy interventions that address this fundamental societal challenge.
