Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, exerts profound and multifaceted effects across numerous societal domains. This review synthesizes existing literature highlighting the detrimental consequences of stratified class structures.  Empirical evidence consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between socioeconomic disparities and reduced health outcomes, encompassing increased morbidity, mortality rates, and decreased life expectancy amongst lower socioeconomic groups.  Educational attainment is significantly impacted, with unequal access to quality education perpetuating intergenerational poverty and limiting social mobility.  Furthermore, class inequality fosters political instability, evidenced by decreased civic engagement amongst marginalized communities and the erosion of democratic processes.  Economic instability, characterized by widening wealth gaps and increased economic insecurity for lower classes, is another significant consequence.  Critically, these effects are interconnected, creating a cyclical pattern that reinforces existing inequalities. While various policy interventions aimed at mitigating class inequality exist, their effectiveness varies significantly depending on context and implementation.  Further research should focus on evaluating the long-term impact of such interventions and exploring innovative approaches to address the complex web of factors contributing to this pervasive social issue.
