This presentation explores the multifaceted dimensions of class inequality and its pervasive effects on society, drawing upon insights from sociology, economics, and political science.  We argue that a solely economic framing of class inequality is insufficient to capture its complex and interwoven consequences.  By integrating perspectives from these disciplines, we demonstrate how socioeconomic disparities manifest not only in disparities of income and wealth, but also in unequal access to education, healthcare, and political representation.  We will examine the sociological mechanisms through which class inequality reproduces itself across generations, including the role of cultural capital and social networks.  Economically, we will analyze how unequal distribution of resources constrains economic growth and exacerbates societal instability.  Finally, the political science lens will highlight how class inequality shapes political participation, influencing policy outcomes and reinforcing existing power structures. This interdisciplinary approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the systemic nature of class inequality and its far-reaching impact on social cohesion, health outcomes, and democratic processes, ultimately highlighting the urgent need for comprehensive and multi-faceted policy interventions.
