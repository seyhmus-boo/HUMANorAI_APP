This presentation explores the role of education in shaping social norms through a novel lens: quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate, the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement offer valuable insights into the complex, probabilistic nature of societal values and individual belief formation.  We propose that education acts as a "measurement" apparatus, collapsing the superposition of potential social norms into a more defined state within an individual.  The curriculum, pedagogical methods, and social interactions within educational settings function as "observers," influencing the probability of specific norms becoming entrenched.  Furthermore, the interconnectedness of individuals within an educational community mirrors quantum entanglement, suggesting that the belief systems of students are not isolated but rather entangled, impacting the collective social norm landscape.  This entangled state, however, is not fixed; ongoing educational engagement continuously influences the probabilities associated with specific norms. By considering education through this quantum framework, we can better understand how seemingly minor interventions can produce significant shifts in collective societal beliefs and behaviors, paving the way for more effective strategies in promoting positive social change.  This presentation will detail this framework and discuss its implications for educational policy and practice.
