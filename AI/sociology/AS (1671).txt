This presentation examines the pivotal role of education in shaping and transforming societal norms.  While often viewed as a vehicle for individual advancement, education acts as a powerful social institution, impacting collective beliefs and behaviours.  We argue that education's influence extends beyond the transmission of knowledge, encompassing the socialization of individuals into specific cultural values and expectations.  Through curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment, educational systems implicitly and explicitly promote certain norms, while potentially challenging others.  This presentation will analyze the mechanisms through which education fosters norm conformity and change, exploring examples such as the promotion of gender equality, the cultivation of civic responsibility, and the dissemination of health-related knowledge.  We will further investigate the interplay between formal and informal educational settings, considering the influence of peer groups and extracurricular activities.  Ultimately, we aim to highlight the significant, yet often under-examined, influence of education in shaping the social fabric and driving societal evolution, underscoring the ethical responsibilities inherent in educational design and implementation.
