This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, tracing its evolution from early online forums to the ubiquitous platforms of today.  While early online communities offered nascent forms of social interaction, the proliferation of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram has dramatically altered the landscape of human connection and self-representation.  We will explore the documented effects of social media on psychological well-being, focusing on issues such as body image distortion, social comparison, and the potential for increased anxiety and depression.  Furthermore, we will analyze the influence of social media algorithms on information consumption and the spread of misinformation, examining their role in shaping political opinions and societal attitudes.  The presentation will critically assess the impact on interpersonal relationships, considering both the benefits of enhanced connectivity and the drawbacks of superficial interactions and a decline in face-to-face communication.  Finally, we will briefly discuss future research directions needed to fully understand the long-term consequences of this pervasive technological influence on human behavior and societal structures.
