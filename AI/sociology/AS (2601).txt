This study investigates the complex relationship between cultural diversity and social integration within multi-ethnic communities.  Drawing upon a mixed-methods approach incorporating quantitative survey data (N=500) and qualitative interviews (n=30) from a diverse urban setting, we examine the mediating roles of intergroup contact, prejudice reduction, and institutional support on the integration process.  Our findings reveal a nuanced picture, indicating that while high levels of cultural diversity are not inherently detrimental to social integration, the quality of intergroup interactions significantly impacts the outcome.  Positive intergroup contact, characterized by frequent and meaningful interactions across cultural lines, was strongly associated with higher levels of social integration, as measured by perceived belonging and social cohesion.  Conversely, prevalent prejudice and inadequate institutional support for cultural diversity were identified as significant barriers to integration.  Furthermore, qualitative data highlighted the importance of shared social spaces and inclusive institutional policies in fostering positive intergroup relations.  These findings suggest that policies aimed at promoting positive intergroup contact, reducing prejudice, and providing robust institutional support are crucial for fostering successful social integration in culturally diverse communities.
