The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, demanding an interdisciplinary approach encompassing economics, sociology, political science, and public health.  While neoclassical economics often prioritizes GDP growth as a proxy for well-being, a broader perspective reveals a more nuanced picture.  Social well-being encompasses factors like health, education, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability, all significantly influenced by economic policy choices.  For instance, austerity measures, driven by macroeconomic stabilization goals, can negatively impact social welfare through reduced public spending on healthcare and education, leading to poorer health outcomes and diminished human capital. Conversely, policies promoting inclusive growth, such as minimum wage increases or investments in social safety nets, can enhance social well-being by reducing inequality and improving living standards, even if at the expense of some short-term economic growth.  Furthermore, sociological research highlights the impact of economic inequality on social cohesion and trust, underscoring the need for policies that address wealth disparities.  Ultimately, effective policymaking requires moving beyond a purely economic lens and integrating insights from diverse disciplines to holistically assess the social consequences of economic choices, promoting equitable and sustainable development that genuinely improves societal well-being.
