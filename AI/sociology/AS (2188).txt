This abstract proposes a novel framework for understanding social movements and their role in societal change, drawing parallels with quantum mechanical principles.  Traditional sociological models often treat social change as a deterministic process.  However, we argue that the inherent unpredictability and emergent properties of collective action align with quantum phenomena.  Specifically, the superposition principle can be applied to individual actors simultaneously holding multiple, potentially conflicting, beliefs and intentions before committing to collective action.  The act of participation collapses this superposition, analogous to wave function collapse, resulting in a measurable shift in the social systemâ€™s state.  Furthermore, entanglement can explain the interconnectedness of individual actions within a movement, where seemingly independent decisions become correlated, leading to amplified collective effects, despite the lack of central coordination.  Measurement problems, inherent in both quantum mechanics and social observation, highlight the difficulties in predicting the trajectory and ultimate success of a movement.  This framework suggests that exploring the entropic effects of dissent and the role of "observers" (e.g., media, government) in shaping the trajectory of collective action may yield valuable insights into the dynamics of social transformation, moving beyond purely deterministic sociological paradigms.  Future research will focus on developing quantitative models based on this framework to test these hypotheses.
