Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, profoundly impacts various aspects of human life, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding.  This abstract highlights the multifaceted consequences of class stratification, drawing upon sociology, economics, psychology, and political science. Sociologically, inequality fuels social unrest and limits social mobility, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage across generations.  Economically, it distorts resource allocation, hindering efficient market mechanisms and fostering economic instability.  Psychological research demonstrates the detrimental effects of socioeconomic disparities on mental health, cognitive development, and well-being, particularly among marginalized groups.  Furthermore, political science reveals how unequal power dynamics, rooted in class divisions, influence policy outcomes, often favoring the interests of dominant classes and exacerbating existing inequalities.  Interdisciplinary research is crucial for developing effective policy interventions.  Future work should focus on integrating these perspectives to design comprehensive strategies that address the root causes of class inequality and promote a more equitable and just society, encompassing targeted social programs, progressive taxation, and equitable access to education and healthcare.  This necessitates moving beyond single-discipline frameworks to achieve truly impactful societal change.
