Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the significant challenge of empirically demonstrating the societal effects of class inequality.  While the existence of class stratification is readily observable, establishing causal links between inequality and its consequences presents considerable methodological hurdles.

Firstly, isolating the independent variable – class inequality – is difficult.  Inequality is intertwined with numerous other societal factors, such as racial disparities, geographic location, and access to resources, creating confounding variables that obfuscate causal relationships.  Experimental designs, the gold standard for causal inference, are inherently limited in their ability to manipulate class inequality ethically and realistically on a large scale.  Natural experiments, such as comparing regions with differing levels of inequality, offer a potential alternative, but suffer from inherent limitations in control and generalisability.

Secondly, measuring the dependent variables – the societal effects – also presents challenges.  Outcomes such as social cohesion, health disparities, and political polarization are complex and multi-faceted, requiring robust and nuanced measurement instruments capable of capturing the subtle effects of inequality.  Consequently, robust evidence linking specific levels of inequality to precise societal outcomes remains elusive, underscoring the need for innovative research methodologies that grapple with these complex, interconnected factors.
