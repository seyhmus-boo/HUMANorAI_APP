This review examines the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms.  Education, encompassing formal schooling and informal learning, acts as a powerful agent of socialization, transmitting societal values, beliefs, and behavioral expectations across generations.  Curricula, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment significantly influence the internalization of norms, promoting conformity or challenging existing structures.  Research highlights the efficacy of education in fostering prosocial behaviors, reducing prejudice, and advancing gender equality, while acknowledging limitations such as the potential for reproducing existing inequalities through biased curricula or unequal access to quality education.  Further, the review considers the impact of social interaction within educational settings, illustrating how peer influence and teacher-student relationships contribute to norm internalization and the development of social capital.  Finally, the complex interplay between education, societal structures, and individual agency in shaping and challenging social norms is emphasized, highlighting the need for future research exploring dynamic interactions and the potential of education to facilitate positive social change.
