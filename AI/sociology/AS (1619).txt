Social movements, collective actions aimed at challenging existing power structures and promoting societal transformation, remain a crucial driver of change.  Recent scholarship emphasizes the increasingly networked and transnational nature of these movements, facilitated by digital technologies.  While traditional theories focused on resource mobilization and framing, contemporary research highlights the significance of emotional contagion, affective polarization, and the role of social media in amplifying mobilization efforts and shaping public narratives.  However, digital platforms also present challenges, including the potential for surveillance, manipulation, and the formation of echo chambers that hinder constructive dialogue and compromise movement efficacy.  Furthermore, the impact of movements varies significantly, influenced by factors such as state repression, counter-movements, and the pre-existing political context.  Emerging research explores the long-term consequences of successful and unsuccessful movements,  highlighting the complexities of institutionalization, the persistence of grievances, and the cyclical nature of social change.  Understanding the interplay between online and offline mobilization, the influence of emotions, and the broader political landscape is crucial for analyzing the evolving role of social movements in shaping contemporary societies.
