Class inequality, a persistent societal ill, transcends disciplinary boundaries, impacting various aspects of human life.  Sociologists illuminate its generation and perpetuation through mechanisms like inherited wealth, unequal access to education and healthcare, and discriminatory labor practices.  Economists demonstrate its correlation with diminished economic growth, hampered innovation, and increased social instability stemming from uneven distribution of resources.  Furthermore, political scientists observe its influence on political participation and representation, often leading to marginalized groups having limited voice in policy decisions.  Psychologists, meanwhile, explore the detrimental effects on individual well-being, highlighting increased stress, anxiety, and reduced life expectancy associated with lower socioeconomic status.  Understanding class inequality, therefore, requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating sociological, economic, political, and psychological perspectives to fully grasp its multifaceted nature and profound societal consequences.  Only through such a holistic lens can we effectively address this complex challenge.
