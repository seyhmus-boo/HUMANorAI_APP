This presentation explores the societal impacts of class inequality through the lens of quantum mechanics, arguing that its effects are not simply additive but exhibit emergent, entangled properties analogous to quantum systems.  We posit that societal structures, analogous to quantum states, are profoundly shaped by the distribution of resources and opportunities, representing a complex superposition of individual and collective experiences.  Class inequality, then, acts as a perturbation, disrupting the equilibrium and leading to measurable societal consequences.

We will draw parallels between the wave-particle duality and the dual nature of individual agency within a constrained social structure. The inherent uncertainty principle suggests limitations in predicting individual trajectories given the pervasive influence of systemic inequalities. Furthermore, the concept of entanglement will be used to illustrate the interconnectedness of seemingly disparate social phenomena resulting from class divisions, such as disparities in health, education, and crime rates.  The presentation will investigate how these entangled effects produce emergent properties, such as social unrest or political polarization, that are not simply predictable from the sum of individual experiences.  Finally, we will discuss potential avenues for intervention, focusing on the possibility of manipulating "social potentials" to mitigate the disruptive effects of class inequality and foster a more equitable and stable societal "ground state."
