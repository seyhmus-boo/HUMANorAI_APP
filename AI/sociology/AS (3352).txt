The evolution of gender roles in modern societies is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding.  Traditional sociological perspectives, focusing on societal structures and power dynamics, offer valuable insights into the historical construction and perpetuation of gender inequality.  However, a complete analysis necessitates incorporating perspectives from other disciplines.  This research paper explores the shifting landscape of gender roles through an integrated lens, drawing upon insights from psychology, which examines individual attitudes and behaviours relating to gender identity and expression; economics, which analyzes the impact of gender on labor markets and wealth distribution; and anthropology, which provides cross-cultural comparisons illuminating the variability and malleability of gender norms.  By integrating these perspectives, we aim to move beyond simplistic narratives of progress or regress, acknowledging the diverse and often contradictory processes shaping gender roles in contemporary contexts.  This study will analyze the influence of globalization, technological advancements, and social movements on the ongoing negotiation and renegotiation of gender expectations, ultimately contributing to a nuanced understanding of this pervasive societal dynamic.
