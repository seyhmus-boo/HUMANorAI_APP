This presentation examines the persistent and evolving impact of class inequality on societal structures and well-being.  Recent scholarship highlights a renewed focus on the multifaceted nature of inequality, moving beyond simple income disparities to encompass wealth concentration, access to quality education and healthcare, and social mobility limitations.  We will explore how these interwoven factors contribute to a widening gap between the affluent and disadvantaged, fueling social unrest and hindering overall societal progress.

Recent developments, such as the exacerbating effects of automation and globalization on employment patterns and wage stagnation for low- and middle-income earners, will be critically analyzed.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the increasingly evident intergenerational transmission of inequality, showcasing how inherited disadvantages significantly constrain opportunities and perpetuate cycles of poverty. Finally, we will briefly examine emerging policy responses aimed at mitigating these effects, such as progressive taxation, wealth redistribution initiatives, and investments in human capital.  The presentation concludes by suggesting avenues for further research, focusing on the need for interdisciplinary approaches to understand and address the complex and multifaceted challenge of class inequality.
