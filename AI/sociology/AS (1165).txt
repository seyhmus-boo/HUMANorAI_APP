Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and transmitting social norms, acting as both a reflector and a shaper of societal values.  Historically, educational institutions have reinforced existing norms through curricula and pedagogy, often implicitly perpetuating inequalities and biases.  However, recent developments highlight a shift towards a more critical and proactive role.  The increasing emphasis on social-emotional learning (SEL) programs, for instance, aims to cultivate empathy, critical thinking, and responsible citizenship, thereby fostering a more inclusive and equitable societal understanding of norms.  Furthermore, the integration of diversity and inclusion initiatives within curricula is challenging established norms by promoting awareness of different perspectives and experiences.  This broadened approach includes the incorporation of diverse voices and narratives, countering dominant narratives and encouraging the critical examination of power dynamics embedded within social norms.  The rise of online education, while presenting challenges regarding equitable access, also offers opportunities to reach wider audiences with diverse perspectives and promote globally aware understandings of social norms, fostering a more interconnected and potentially more tolerant global citizenry. However, the effectiveness of these initiatives remains contingent upon systemic changes that address issues of inequitable access and resource allocation within the education system itself.
