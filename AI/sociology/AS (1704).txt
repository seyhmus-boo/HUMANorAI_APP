Good morning, class. Today's lecture focuses on the profound impact of social media on human behaviour.  We can conceptualize social media's influence as a powerful, yet often invisible, gravitational force.  Just as celestial bodies are drawn towards each other, individuals are drawn into the digital orbit of likes, comments, and shares.  This creates a feedback loop, akin to a Pavlovian response, where the dopamine rush associated with positive engagement reinforces continued platform usage, even at the cost of real-world interactions.

Furthermore, the curated nature of online personas resembles a distorted funhouse mirror.  Users present idealized versions of themselves, leading to social comparison and potentially triggering feelings of inadequacy.  This "keeping up with the Joneses" phenomenon, amplified by the constant stream of visually stunning content, can contribute to anxiety and depression.  The echo chamber effect, where users are primarily exposed to information confirming pre-existing beliefs, further exacerbates societal polarization, much like a river carving a deeper channel in the same path over time.  Therefore, understanding social media's gravitational pull and its distorting lens is crucial to mitigating its potentially detrimental effects on our behaviour.
