This presentation examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, tracing its evolution through historical contexts.  Historically, laissez-faire economics prioritized economic growth, often neglecting social consequences, leading to periods of stark inequality and social unrest, as exemplified by the Gilded Age and the early Industrial Revolution.  Conversely, the post-World War II era witnessed the rise of the welfare state, with governments actively intervening to mitigate inequality and enhance social safety nets, resulting in improved health and education outcomes across many developed nations.  However, the limitations of expansive welfare systems, including budgetary constraints and potential disincentives to work, have prompted renewed interest in market-based approaches.

This presentation argues that an optimal balance must be struck.  We will analyze various policy tools, including progressive taxation, social safety nets, and investment in human capital, assessing their effectiveness in promoting social well-being while considering economic sustainability.  Furthermore, we will explore the challenges of measuring social well-being accurately, highlighting the limitations of GDP as a sole indicator and the increasing importance of multi-dimensional indices.  Finally, the presentation concludes by discussing the need for evidence-based policymaking that considers both economic efficiency and social justice to foster sustainable and equitable societal outcomes.
