This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, drawing upon insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and political science.  We argue that while cultural diversity can enrich societal life, its impact on social integration is complex and contingent upon various factors.  Sociological perspectives will be utilized to examine the role of social structures, institutions, and policies in either facilitating or hindering integration processes within diverse populations. Anthropological lenses will illuminate the diverse ways in which individuals negotiate their cultural identities within a pluralistic context.  Psychological research on intergroup relations and prejudice will be considered to understand the cognitive and emotional processes that underpin both inclusion and exclusion. Finally, we will analyze the political dimensions of integration, including policy frameworks aimed at promoting cohesion and addressing potential conflicts arising from cultural differences.  The presentation will conclude by highlighting the need for interdisciplinary collaboration in developing effective strategies to foster inclusive societies that celebrate diversity while simultaneously ensuring social cohesion and equity.  Empirical examples from various national contexts will be used to illustrate the key arguments.
