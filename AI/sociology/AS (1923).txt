Urbanization, a defining characteristic of the 21st century, profoundly reshapes community life, presenting both challenges and opportunities. This presentation examines recent developments in the interplay between urbanization and community dynamics, focusing on three key areas. Firstly, we analyze the impact of densification and mixed-use developments on social cohesion, exploring whether increased population density necessarily translates to diminished community engagement or fosters novel forms of social interaction.  Secondly, the presentation will discuss the role of technology in mediating community life within urban contexts.  We examine the emergence of online platforms and digital tools that facilitate community building, alongside concerns regarding digital divides and the potential for increased social isolation. Finally, we consider the influence of urban planning policies on community resilience and well-being.  Recent studies reveal the effectiveness of initiatives promoting green spaces, accessible public transport, and community-led development in fostering stronger, more resilient urban communities.  By examining these trends, this presentation aims to offer insights into the evolving landscape of urban community life and propose strategies for promoting positive community outcomes in the face of rapid urbanization.
