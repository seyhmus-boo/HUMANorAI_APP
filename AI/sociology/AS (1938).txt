This review examines the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, synthesizing existing scholarship to assess both homogenizing and heterogenizing effects. While globalization fosters cultural exchange and diffusion, leading to the adoption of global trends in consumption and communication, its influence on local traditions is complex and often contested.  Studies reveal a tendency towards cultural homogenization, with the dominance of global media and multinational corporations potentially leading to the erosion of unique cultural practices and linguistic diversity. However, globalization also facilitates the revitalization of local cultures through increased awareness and the development of hybrid cultural forms.  Glocalization, the adaptation of global trends to local contexts, demonstrates the agency of local communities in shaping the reception and integration of global influences.  Further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of globalization on cultural resilience and the equitable distribution of benefits and costs across diverse cultural landscapes.  The ongoing tension between global integration and local distinctiveness remains a key area of inquiry in understanding the evolving dynamics of culture in an increasingly interconnected world.
