Social movements, characterized by collective action outside established institutional channels, play a crucial role in driving societal change. This lecture examines the mechanisms through which these movements effect transformative shifts in social norms, policies, and power structures.  Resource mobilization theory highlights the importance of organizational capacity and access to resources in a movement's success, while framing theory emphasizes the construction of narratives that resonate with public sentiment.  Furthermore, political opportunity structures, encompassing the existing political climate and the receptiveness of elites to demands, significantly influence the effectiveness of mobilization efforts.  Successful movements effectively leverage these factors, strategically framing grievances, mobilizing resources, and exploiting opportune political climates to challenge dominant ideologies and achieve their objectives. This process often involves a complex interplay of contentious politics, negotiation, and compromise, ultimately resulting in incremental or transformative societal changes. The long-term impact of a social movement depends on its ability to achieve institutionalization of its goals and to maintain sustained momentum.
