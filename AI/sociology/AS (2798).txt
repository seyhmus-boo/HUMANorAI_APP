The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, posing significant challenges for empirical investigation. While macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth offer a broad measure of economic performance, their correlation with social well-being, encompassing factors such as health, education, and social cohesion, is often weak and indirect.  Establishing causality is particularly difficult, hindered by the inherent complexities of disentangling policy effects from other confounding variables, including pre-existing societal conditions and external shocks.

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), often lauded for their internal validity, face limitations in this context.  The scale and long-term nature of many policy interventions make large-scale RCTs prohibitively expensive and logistically challenging.  Furthermore, ethical concerns arise when randomly assigning individuals or communities to different policy regimes, particularly when significant welfare implications are involved.  Natural experiments offer an alternative, leveraging exogenous shocks or policy discontinuities as quasi-random assignments.  However, these designs often suffer from limitations in external validity and the potential for selection bias, compromising the generalizability of findings.  Consequently, researchers increasingly rely on econometric techniques, such as instrumental variables and difference-in-differences, to address endogeneity and establish credible causal links.  Despite these methodological advances, accurately measuring and interpreting the complex interplay between economic policies and multifaceted dimensions of social well-being remains a considerable methodological challenge.
