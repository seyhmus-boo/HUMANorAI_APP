Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, generating both homogenization and hybridization. This presentation examines the nuanced effects of globalization on cultural preservation and transformation, focusing on the interplay between global flows of information, capital, and people, and the resilience of local traditions.  We analyze the contradictory processes of cultural diffusion and appropriation, exploring how global trends can lead to the erosion of unique cultural practices while simultaneously fostering new hybrid forms of cultural expression.  Case studies will illustrate the diverse experiences of communities across different geographical locations and socio-economic contexts, highlighting the uneven distribution of globalization's impacts.  The presentation argues that while globalization presents challenges to cultural diversity, local cultures demonstrate remarkable adaptive capacity, often integrating global elements into existing frameworks.  Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for cultural preservation policies and initiatives, emphasizing the importance of supporting locally-driven strategies that promote both cultural sustainability and intercultural dialogue.
