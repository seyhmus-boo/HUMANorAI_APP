This presentation explores the ongoing evolution of gender roles in modern societies, highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary perspectives necessary for a comprehensive understanding.  While traditional gender binaries are increasingly challenged, their persistence demonstrates the complex interplay of social, economic, and biological factors.  We will examine sociological analyses of changing family structures, workplace dynamics, and political representation, demonstrating shifts in power relations and expectations.  Furthermore, psychological insights into gender identity formation and expression, including the influence of socialization and media representations, will be integrated.  Economic analyses will explore the gender pay gap and its intersection with educational attainment and occupational segregation.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon biological perspectives, acknowledging the influence of hormonal and neurological factors while emphasizing the limitations of biological determinism in explaining societal gender roles.  By weaving together these interdisciplinary threads, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the complexities inherent in the ongoing transformation of gender roles and the significant implications for social justice and equity.
