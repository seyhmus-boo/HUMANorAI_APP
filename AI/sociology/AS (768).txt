Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and reinforcing social norms, functioning as both a transmitter and a potential transformer of societal values.  Formal curricula explicitly convey norms through the teaching of history, civics, and social studies, imparting societal expectations regarding behavior, morality, and citizenship.  However, the hidden curriculum, encompassing the informal socialization processes within educational institutions, also exerts significant influence.  Interactions with peers and authority figures, institutional structures, and the implicit reward and punishment systems contribute to the internalization of dominant norms.  Furthermore, education can facilitate critical thinking and self-reflection, potentially fostering challenges to existing norms and leading to their evolution.  The extent to which education reinforces or challenges prevailing social norms depends on factors including the curriculum's content, pedagogical approaches, and the broader socio-political context.  Empirical research is needed to fully delineate the complex interplay between education's transmission and transformation of societal values, specifically exploring how educational interventions can effectively promote positive social change.
