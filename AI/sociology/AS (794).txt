This presentation examines the persistent and evolving issue of class inequality and its multifaceted societal consequences.  Recent developments, particularly the exacerbation of inequality following the COVID-19 pandemic and ongoing inflationary pressures, necessitate a renewed focus on this critical social determinant of health and well-being.  We will explore how these recent events have disproportionately impacted vulnerable populations, widening existing gaps in access to resources like healthcare, education, and housing.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the relationship between rising inequality and societal instability, referencing recent research on the correlation between economic disparity and increased social unrest, political polarization, and declining social mobility.  The discussion will move beyond simple wealth distribution metrics to incorporate nuanced understandings of intergenerational wealth transfer, access to quality employment, and the role of discriminatory practices in perpetuating class stratification.  Finally, we will briefly consider emerging policy interventions and their potential effectiveness in mitigating class inequality and fostering a more equitable society.  The presentation aims to stimulate critical discussion and encourage further research into this urgent and complex issue.
