Class inequality, a persistent societal feature throughout history, manifests as the uneven distribution of resources, opportunities, and power across social strata.  Historically, feudal systems and subsequent industrial revolutions solidified class divisions, with land ownership and capital accumulation serving as primary differentiators.  The transition to capitalism exacerbated these inequalities, creating a dichotomy between the bourgeoisie and proletariat, a dynamic extensively analyzed by Marx. While the 20th century witnessed some progress via welfare states and progressive taxation, significant disparities persist in the 21st century.

The effects of class inequality are multifaceted and profoundly impact societal well-being.  Economic disparities lead to reduced social mobility, limiting individuals' life chances based on their birth circumstances.  This perpetuates a cycle of poverty and disadvantage, impacting health outcomes, educational attainment, and crime rates.  Furthermore, high levels of inequality erode social cohesion, fostering resentment and distrust between social groups, potentially leading to political instability and social unrest.  Finally, inequality undermines democratic principles by disproportionately influencing political processes and reinforcing existing power structures, hindering effective governance and equitable policy-making.  Addressing this complex issue necessitates a multi-pronged approach encompassing progressive taxation, investment in education and healthcare, and robust social safety nets.
