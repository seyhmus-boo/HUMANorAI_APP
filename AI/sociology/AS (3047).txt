Social movements, defined as collective actions aimed at societal transformation, represent a crucial engine of change.  Understanding their dynamics requires an inherently interdisciplinary approach.  Sociology provides frameworks for analyzing collective behaviour, mobilization, and the role of leadership and framing.  Political science examines the interaction between movements and the state, exploring strategies of influence, negotiation, and repression.  History illuminates the long-term impact of movements, demonstrating both successes and failures, and contextualizing their development within specific historical junctures.  Anthropology contributes nuanced understanding of cultural values and beliefs that shape participation and movement goals.  Furthermore, economics sheds light on the resource mobilization necessary for sustained action, and psychology examines the psychological factors motivating individual engagement and commitment.  The convergence of these disciplines offers a richer, more complete understanding of social movements' complex relationship with societal change, revealing the interplay of structure, agency, and ideology in driving transformative processes.
