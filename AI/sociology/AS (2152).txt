Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies since the Neolithic Revolution, manifests as the uneven distribution of resources, power, and opportunities based on socioeconomic stratification. Historically, feudal systems rigidly defined class through inherited status, while industrial capitalism fostered a more fluid, yet equally stratified, system based on ownership of capital.  This stratification has profound societal effects.

High levels of inequality correlate with reduced social mobility, limiting individual potential and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  Furthermore, it undermines social cohesion, fostering resentment and distrust between socioeconomic groups.  Increased crime rates, poor public health outcomes, and political instability are frequently observed consequences.  The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a few also distorts democratic processes, leading to policies that favour the elite at the expense of the broader population.  Addressing class inequality therefore requires multifaceted interventions targeting education, healthcare, taxation, and social welfare, aiming to promote a more equitable and just society.
