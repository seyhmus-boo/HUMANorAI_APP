This presentation examines the evolving impact of social media on human behavior, focusing on recent developments in research. While established effects such as social comparison and information dissemination remain crucial, the focus has shifted towards understanding the nuanced interplay between platform algorithms, user engagement, and behavioral outcomes.  Recent studies highlight the concerning rise in mental health issues correlated with excessive social media use, particularly anxiety and depression, driven by factors like cyberbullying and the curated nature of online personas.  Furthermore, the proliferation of misinformation and the amplification of echo chambers via algorithmic filtering necessitate critical analysis of the impact on political polarization and societal trust.  This presentation will synthesize recent findings on the impact of social media on self-esteem, body image, political attitudes, and interpersonal relationships, considering the role of platform design and individual user characteristics.  Finally, it will briefly discuss emerging research on interventions aimed at mitigating the negative impacts of social media while harnessing its positive potential for community building and social change.
