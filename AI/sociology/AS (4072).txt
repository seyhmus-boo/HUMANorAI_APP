This presentation explores the multifaceted nature of class inequality and its pervasive effects on society, drawing upon insights from sociology, economics, and political science.  We argue that a purely economic lens is insufficient to fully comprehend the complex web of social, political, and psychological consequences stemming from unequal distribution of resources and power.  

Sociologically, we examine how class stratification reinforces social hierarchies, impacting access to education, healthcare, and social mobility, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage.  Economically, we analyze the impact of income inequality on aggregate demand, economic growth, and social cohesion, highlighting the potential for instability arising from widening wealth gaps.  Politically, we discuss the influence of class on political participation, policy outcomes, and the legitimacy of democratic institutions, emphasizing the potential for marginalized groups to be politically disenfranchised.

An interdisciplinary approach is crucial to understanding the interplay of these factors.  By integrating sociological perspectives on social reproduction with economic analyses of market mechanisms and political science's focus on power dynamics, we aim to provide a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the pervasive and damaging effects of class inequality, ultimately suggesting avenues for policy interventions that address this pressing social issue.
