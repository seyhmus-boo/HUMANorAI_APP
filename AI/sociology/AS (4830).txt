This research explores the hitherto unexplored interface between economic policy and social well-being through a quantum mechanical framework.  We posit that societal well-being, rather than existing as a purely classical, deterministic entity, exhibits quantum-like characteristics, specifically superposition and entanglement.  Economic policies, then, act as operators influencing the "wave function" of social well-being, causing transitions between different states representing varying levels of societal health.  Using a modified Ising model, we represent individual well-being as quantum spins, coupled through social interactions represented by exchange interactions.  Different economic policies – e.g., redistribution schemes, investment in public goods – are modeled as external magnetic fields influencing spin alignment, thereby impacting the overall system's ground state energy, a proxy for aggregate well-being. Preliminary results suggest that policies promoting social cohesion and equity, represented by strong, homogeneous fields, lead to lower energy states, corresponding to higher overall well-being.  Conversely, policies fostering inequality, represented by heterogeneous or weak fields, result in higher energy states and reduced social well-being.  Future work will focus on developing more sophisticated models incorporating environmental factors and exploring the impact of policy uncertainty on the quantum state of the system.  This quantum approach offers a novel perspective on policy evaluation by acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and interconnectedness of social dynamics.
