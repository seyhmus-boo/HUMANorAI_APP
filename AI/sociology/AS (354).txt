Education plays a multifaceted role in shaping and perpetuating social norms, impacting both individual beliefs and societal structures.  This paper argues that formal education acts as a powerful socializing agent, transmitting dominant cultural values and norms through curricula, pedagogical practices, and the hidden curriculum.  Analysis reveals how educational institutions reinforce existing power structures, potentially leading to the reproduction of inequalities through implicit biases embedded within educational systems. Conversely, education also serves as a platform for critical engagement with social norms, fostering critical thinking skills and challenging established hierarchies.  Progressive pedagogical approaches, inclusive curricula, and culturally responsive teaching methodologies can actively contribute to the transformation of social norms, promoting inclusivity, equity, and social justice. However, the effectiveness of education in social norm transformation is contingent upon broader societal factors, including economic disparities and political will.  Further research is needed to explore the dynamic interplay between educational practices, individual agency, and the broader socio-political context in determining the ultimate impact of education on shaping evolving social norms.
