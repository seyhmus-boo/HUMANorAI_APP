This paper examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simplistic correlation to explore nuanced causal pathways and mediating factors. We argue that while economic growth is often cited as a prerequisite for enhanced social well-being, the type and implementation of economic policies significantly influence their ultimate impact on societal outcomes.  Our analysis employs a comparative case study approach, examining contrasting policy regimes in developed and developing nations, focusing on the impact of fiscal policies, social safety nets, and labor market regulations on key indicators of social well-being, including health, education, and inequality.  We hypothesize that policies prioritizing inclusive growth, robust social protection, and equitable resource distribution demonstrably lead to higher levels of social well-being, whereas policies focused solely on macroeconomic indicators can exacerbate social disparities and negatively affect overall societal health.  Furthermore, we explore the role of institutional capacity and governance in mediating the effectiveness of economic policies in achieving social objectives.  The findings contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between economic choices and societal outcomes, informing policy design for more equitable and sustainable development.
