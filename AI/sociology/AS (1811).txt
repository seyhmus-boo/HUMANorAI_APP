This presentation investigates the complex and multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  While economic growth is often presented as a primary indicator of societal progress, its impact on social well-being is neither uniform nor automatically positive.  This research examines the mediating role of various factors, including income inequality, access to healthcare and education, and environmental sustainability, in determining the link between specific economic policies and improvements in social well-being.  We analyze the effects of different policy approaches, such as neoliberal austerity measures versus Keynesian stimulus packages, on key social indicators, including life expectancy, poverty rates, and social cohesion.  Drawing upon empirical evidence from both developed and developing economies, we argue that a narrow focus solely on economic growth, without considering its distributional consequences and impacts on social determinants of health and opportunity, can ultimately undermine social well-being. The presentation concludes by suggesting a more holistic approach to policy-making that prioritizes social justice and inclusive growth to achieve sustainable improvements in social well-being alongside economic prosperity.  This involves a shift toward policies that promote equitable distribution of resources, invest in human capital, and address environmental challenges.
