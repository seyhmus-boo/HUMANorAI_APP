This presentation examines the evolving role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on recent developments and challenges.  While traditional models emphasized collective action and resource mobilization, contemporary movements increasingly leverage digital technologies and transnational networks to achieve their goals.  We explore the impact of social media on mobilization, framing, and the dissemination of information, highlighting both its empowering potential and the risks associated with misinformation and algorithmic manipulation.  Furthermore, the presentation analyzes the rise of decentralized and leaderless movements, examining their organizational structures and effectiveness in achieving significant policy changes.  Recent examples, such as the Black Lives Matter movement and climate activism, will be used to illustrate the diverse strategies employed and the varied outcomes achieved.  The discussion will also address the challenges faced by contemporary movements, including issues of internal cohesion, counter-mobilization, and the limitations of online activism in achieving lasting systemic change.  Ultimately, this presentation argues for a nuanced understanding of social movements, acknowledging their complex interplay with technological advancements and established power structures.
