This presentation explores the multifaceted nature of class inequality and its pervasive effects on society, emphasizing crucial interdisciplinary linkages.  We move beyond a purely economic lens to examine how class intersects with sociological, psychological, and political dimensions to shape individual life chances and broader societal structures.  The sociological analysis focuses on the reproduction of inequality across generations, highlighting the roles of education, occupation, and social networks in perpetuating class disparities.  We then delve into the psychological impacts, exploring the correlation between socioeconomic status and mental health outcomes, as well as the implications for cognitive development and social mobility.  Furthermore, the political implications are examined, focusing on how class inequality influences political participation, voting patterns, and the formulation of public policy.  This interdisciplinary approach reveals the complex and interwoven nature of class inequality, demonstrating how economic disparities are not isolated phenomena but rather deeply embedded within the fabric of social, psychological, and political life.  We conclude by suggesting avenues for future research that further illuminate these interconnected dimensions and facilitate the development of more effective policies aimed at mitigating class inequality and its detrimental societal consequences.
