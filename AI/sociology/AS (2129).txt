The sociology of mental health examines the social determinants, consequences, and experiences of mental illness.  Recent developments significantly broaden this field, moving beyond the traditional medical modelâ€™s focus on individual pathology.  A growing body of research emphasizes the profound influence of social inequalities on mental health outcomes, highlighting disparities across socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, gender, and sexual orientation.  This includes investigations into the social stressors associated with poverty, discrimination, and marginalization, which demonstrably increase vulnerability to mental illness.  Furthermore, the social construction of mental illness itself is increasingly scrutinized, revealing how cultural norms and societal reactions shape diagnostic practices and treatment approaches.  Recent work explores the impact of social media on mental well-being, considering both its potential benefits and the detrimental effects of cyberbullying, online harassment, and the pervasive comparison culture.  Finally,  sociological research is increasingly engaged with the development and implementation of socially just and equitable mental health policies and services, addressing the need for culturally competent care and accessible community-based support systems that mitigate the broader social implications of mental distress.
