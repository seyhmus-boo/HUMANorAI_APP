This presentation explores the multifaceted role of education in shaping and transforming social norms, drawing on insights from sociology, psychology, and anthropology.  We argue that education transcends the mere transmission of knowledge; it acts as a powerful socializing agent, influencing individual attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors that collectively constitute social norms.  The interdisciplinary lens reveals how pedagogical approaches, curriculum content, and the broader school environment interact to foster either conformity or challenge to existing norms.  For example, sociological analysis highlights how educational institutions can reinforce existing power structures and inequalities, thereby perpetuating discriminatory norms. Conversely, psychological research demonstrates the efficacy of educational interventions in promoting prosocial behavior and challenging prejudice.  Anthropological perspectives offer valuable insights into how different cultural contexts shape the relationship between education and norm formation.  This presentation will examine specific case studies illustrating these interdisciplinary linkages, ultimately arguing that a nuanced understanding of educationâ€™s influence requires a holistic approach that integrates diverse theoretical frameworks and empirical findings.  The implications for designing effective educational strategies aimed at positive social change will be discussed.
