This presentation explores the complex and often contested relationship between economic policies and social well-being, examining how shifts in economic thought have shaped societal outcomes throughout history.  Historically, laissez-faire capitalism, dominant from the 18th century, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention, often resulting in significant social inequalities and periodic crises.  The 20th century witnessed a shift towards Keynesian economics, emphasizing government intervention to manage aggregate demand and mitigate unemployment, fostering a period of relative prosperity but also raising concerns about state overreach and unsustainable debt.

More recently, neoliberal policies, emphasizing deregulation, privatization, and free trade, have generated considerable debate regarding their impact on social well-being. While proponents cite increased efficiency and economic growth, critics highlight rising income inequality, job insecurity, and erosion of social safety nets.  This presentation will analyze these historical trajectories, focusing on key policy instruments – taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulation – and their demonstrable effects on various dimensions of social well-being, including health, education, and social cohesion.  Ultimately, the presentation argues for a nuanced understanding of the intricate interplay between economic goals and social outcomes, advocating for policy frameworks that prioritize both economic efficiency and equitable distribution of resources.
