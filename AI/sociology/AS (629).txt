This presentation explores the pivotal role of education in shaping and transforming social norms throughout history.  Historically, education systems, often intentionally, served to reinforce existing power structures and societal norms, perpetuating inequalities and limiting social mobility.  From the classical Greek emphasis on civic virtue to the Victorian era's focus on moral instruction, curricula reflected prevailing ideologies and social hierarchies, shaping individual behaviours and societal expectations accordingly.  

However, education's capacity for social change is also undeniable.  Progressive educational movements of the 20th century, advocating for critical thinking, inclusivity, and social justice, demonstrate education's potential to challenge established norms and promote equitable societal transformations. This presentation will examine case studies illustrating both the conservative and progressive functions of education, highlighting how curricula, pedagogy, and institutional structures interact to shape individual values, beliefs, and ultimately, societal norms.  We will argue that a critical understanding of education's historical trajectory is crucial for designing future educational systems capable of fostering positive social change and promoting more just and equitable societies.
