This presentation examines the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, focusing on recent theoretical and empirical developments.  While increasing cultural diversity offers significant societal benefits, including enhanced creativity and economic dynamism, it also presents challenges to social cohesion.  Recent research highlights the crucial role of inclusive policies and institutional frameworks in mitigating potential conflicts and fostering genuine integration.  We will analyze the impact of factors such as intergroup contact, perceived discrimination, and the availability of resources and opportunities on the integration process.  Specific attention will be paid to emerging research on the effectiveness of different integration strategies, including multiculturalism, assimilation, and integrationist approaches.  Moreover, the presentation will critically assess the limitations of existing integration frameworks in addressing the nuanced experiences of diverse migrant populations, particularly those facing systemic barriers and marginalization. Finally, it will briefly outline promising avenues for future research, emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies and more nuanced qualitative methodologies to capture the complexity of cultural diversity's impact on social integration.
