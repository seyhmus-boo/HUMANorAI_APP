This paper investigates the complex relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond simple correlations to explore causal mechanisms and contextual factors.  We examine a range of policy interventions, including fiscal policies (taxation and spending), monetary policies (interest rates and inflation control), and labor market policies (minimum wage, unemployment benefits), assessing their impact on various dimensions of social well-being, such as health, education, income inequality, and social cohesion.  Employing a mixed-methods approach, encompassing quantitative analyses of macroeconomic data from OECD countries over several decades and qualitative case studies of specific policy implementations, we identify significant heterogeneity in policy effectiveness.  Findings suggest that while pro-growth policies can positively influence overall well-being, their distributional effects are critical.  Policies prioritizing social safety nets and investments in human capital demonstrably mitigate inequality and enhance long-term societal well-being, even if associated with marginally lower GDP growth in the short term.  Our research highlights the need for policy design that explicitly considers social objectives alongside economic targets, emphasizing the importance of inclusive growth and equitable distribution of resources for sustainable improvements in social well-being.
