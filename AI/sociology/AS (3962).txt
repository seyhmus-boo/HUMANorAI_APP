This presentation explores the impact of globalization on local cultures through the lens of quantum mechanics, moving beyond traditional sociological frameworks. We propose a conceptual model where cultural elements, analogous to quantum particles, exist in a superposition of states, exhibiting both local and global characteristics simultaneously. Globalization, represented as a complex, entangled system, induces decoherence, collapsing these superpositions and affecting the probability distribution of cultural expressions.  

We hypothesize that stronger globalization leads to increased entanglement between local and global cultural elements, resulting in a greater probability of observing homogenized cultural forms. However, we also consider the possibility of quantum tunneling, representing the emergence of unexpected hybrid cultural forms or the surprising persistence of seemingly fragile local traditions despite global pressures.  This presentation will examine empirical evidence supporting these conceptual parallels, focusing on the interplay between interconnectedness (entanglement) and the preservation of unique cultural identities (decoherence).  Ultimately, we aim to demonstrate the potential of a quantum-inspired framework to provide novel insights into the complex dynamics of globalization's impact on cultural diversity.
