Education's role in shaping social norms is a subject of ongoing debate, with experimental investigations facing significant challenges.  While intuitively, education should foster norm internalization through the transmission of knowledge and values, empirically demonstrating this causal link proves difficult.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are ideal, yet often impractical due to the long-term nature of norm change and ethical concerns regarding curriculum manipulation.  Furthermore, isolating education's effect from confounding variables like peer influence, family background, and pre-existing beliefs presents a substantial hurdle.  Quasi-experimental designs, using naturally occurring variations in educational access or quality, offer alternatives but introduce selection bias and difficulties in accurately measuring exposure and outcomes.  Measuring norm internalization itself is complex, requiring nuanced methodologies that transcend simple self-reported attitudes and incorporate behavioral observations. Future research should prioritize robust methodologies that address these challenges, potentially combining longitudinal studies with innovative techniques like agent-based modelling to dissect the intricate interplay between education and social norms.  This will enhance our understanding of education's impact and inform effective interventions for promoting positive social change.
