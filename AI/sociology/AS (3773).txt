Globalization's impact on local cultures remains a complex and hotly debated topic. While proponents emphasize increased cultural exchange and understanding, critics highlight the homogenizing effects of global media and consumerism, leading to cultural erosion and loss of diversity. This presentation examines recent developments in this ongoing dialectic, focusing on the interplay between global flows and localized resistance.  We will analyze the rise of "glocalization," where global trends are adapted and reinterpreted to fit local contexts, providing examples from diverse regions.  Further, we will explore the role of digital technologies in both accelerating cultural homogenization (through platforms like TikTok and Instagram) and fostering cultural revitalization (through online communities preserving indigenous languages and traditions).  Recent research suggests a nuanced picture, moving beyond simplistic narratives of either wholesale cultural dominance or complete resilience.  The presentation argues that globalization's impact is not uniform, with specific outcomes contingent on factors such as pre-existing power structures, levels of economic development, and the agency of local communities in shaping the reception and integration of global influences.  Finally, we will discuss implications for cultural preservation strategies in the face of ongoing globalization.
