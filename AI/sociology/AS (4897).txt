This presentation examines the persistent and evolving nature of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on contemporary society.  Recent developments highlight a complex interplay of economic, political, and social factors exacerbating pre-existing disparities.  While traditional markers of class, such as income and wealth, remain crucial,  new research emphasizes the growing importance of precarious employment, educational attainment gaps, and intergenerational wealth transmission in shaping class structures.  We will explore the consequences of this inequality, focusing on its impact on health outcomes, social mobility, political participation, and societal cohesion.  Recent studies demonstrating the link between economic inequality and increased rates of social unrest and political polarization will be discussed.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze emerging policy debates surrounding wealth taxation, universal basic income, and strengthened social safety nets as potential responses to mitigate class inequality and foster a more equitable society.  Finally, we will consider the limitations of existing data and methodologies in fully capturing the complexities of class inequality in the 21st century.
