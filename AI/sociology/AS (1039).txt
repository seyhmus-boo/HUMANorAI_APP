Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the persistent issue of class inequality and its societal ramifications, particularly in light of recent developments.  While class stratification has always existed, contemporary trends exhibit a worrying intensification.  Globalization and technological advancements, while generating wealth, have simultaneously exacerbated income disparities, leading to a concentration of resources in the hands of a shrinking elite. This concentration is reflected in widening gaps in wealth, access to quality education and healthcare, and political influence.

The consequences are multifaceted.  Increased inequality correlates with diminished social mobility, creating a rigid class system that perpetuates disadvantage across generations.  Furthermore, high levels of inequality are linked to increased crime rates, social unrest, and a decline in overall societal well-being, as documented in recent studies by Piketty and others.  The erosion of the middle class, a notable recent development, further destabilizes the social fabric, impacting political polarization and public trust in institutions.  Addressing this requires a multi-pronged approach, encompassing progressive taxation, investments in social safety nets, and policies promoting fair access to opportunities.  Failure to do so risks further societal fragmentation and instability.
