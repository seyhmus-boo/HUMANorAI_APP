This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in researching the multifaceted effects of class inequality on society.  While observational studies readily reveal correlations between socioeconomic status and various social outcomes (health, education, crime), establishing causal links remains elusive.  The inherent difficulty in randomly assigning individuals to different class strata necessitates creative experimental designs.  This presentation critically examines existing methodologies, including field experiments leveraging naturally occurring variations in income or resource allocation, and lab experiments exploring behavioral responses to simulated inequality.  We discuss the limitations of each approach, highlighting issues such as external validity, ethical considerations in manipulating socioeconomic conditions, and the challenges of capturing the complex, cumulative effects of inequality across generations.  Furthermore, we consider the potential of innovative methods, such as agent-based modelling and virtual reality experiments, to address some of these limitations and advance our understanding of the causal mechanisms linking class inequality to broader societal outcomes.  Ultimately, we aim to stimulate discussion on methodological innovation to better capture the pervasive and profound impacts of class inequality.
