This presentation examines the pivotal role of education in shaping and transforming social norms.  While socialization processes begin early, formal education offers a structured environment to cultivate desired societal values and behaviors.  We argue that education's influence extends beyond the transmission of knowledge; it actively constructs social norms through curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the creation of shared experiences. This presentation will explore how different educational strategies – including inclusive curricula, experiential learning, and critical pedagogy – can effectively challenge harmful norms and foster positive social change.  

Practical applications will be explored through case studies demonstrating the impact of specific educational interventions. For instance, we will analyze programs aimed at combating gender inequality, promoting intergroup understanding, and mitigating the spread of misinformation.  The presentation will also discuss the limitations and potential unintended consequences of educational interventions on norm formation, emphasizing the need for nuanced and context-specific approaches. Ultimately, we contend that a deliberate and strategic engagement with education's normative power is crucial for fostering equitable and sustainable societies.
