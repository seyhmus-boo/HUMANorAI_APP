Good morning. Today's lecture will examine the evolving impact of social media on human behaviour.  While earlier research focused primarily on issues of self-esteem and online identity, recent developments highlight more nuanced effects.  The proliferation of algorithmic curation, for instance, fosters filter bubbles and echo chambers, reinforcing pre-existing biases and potentially contributing to political polarization.  Furthermore, the pervasive nature of social media facilitates the rapid spread of misinformation and disinformation, impacting public health decisions and democratic processes.

Studies employing longitudinal data are now revealing the long-term consequences of heavy social media use, particularly concerning mental health.  Increased rates of anxiety and depression, linked to social comparison and cyberbullying, are increasingly documented.  However, the relationship isn't simply causal; existing vulnerabilities may predispose individuals to negative experiences within these online platforms.  Therefore, future research must focus on mediating factors and develop more robust methodologies to disentangle complex interactions between individual predispositions and social media's influence on behaviour.
