Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, continues to exert profound and multifaceted effects on social structures and individual well-being. While the concept itself is longstanding, recent developments necessitate a renewed examination of its scope and consequences.  This paper explores the evolving nature of class inequality and its contemporary societal impacts, focusing particularly on the interplay between technological advancements, globalization, and increasingly polarized political landscapes.  Recent research highlights a widening gap between the wealthiest and poorest segments of populations globally, fueled by factors such as automation-driven job displacement, stagnant wages for low-skill labor, and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a diminishing elite.  Furthermore, the influence of social media and algorithmic biases in exacerbating existing inequalities warrants detailed consideration. This study investigates these emerging trends, analyzing their impact on various social indicators, including health outcomes, educational attainment, political participation, and social cohesion.  Ultimately, the paper aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics of class inequality and inform strategies for promoting greater social equity.
