This presentation examines the complex and often contested role of education in shaping social norms, focusing on the methodological challenges inherent in experimentally evaluating its impact.  While intuitively, education appears to be a powerful agent of social change, demonstrating a causal link through rigorous experimentation proves difficult.  We will discuss several key challenges:  the inherent difficulty in isolating the effects of education from other societal influences (e.g., family, peer groups, media), the ethical complexities of manipulating educational interventions, and the limitations of traditional experimental designs in capturing the long-term, nuanced effects on deeply ingrained norms. We will analyze the strengths and weaknesses of existing experimental studies, highlighting cases where causal inference is strong and where it remains weak.  Furthermore, we will explore alternative methodological approaches, including quasi-experimental designs, natural experiments, and longitudinal studies, which offer more feasible avenues for investigating the subtle and multifaceted ways education shapes social norms, particularly in relation to sensitive issues such as gender equality, intergroup relations, and environmental sustainability.  The presentation concludes by suggesting promising avenues for future research aimed at strengthening the causal evidence base in this critical area.
