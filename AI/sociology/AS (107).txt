This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, moving beyond simplistic narratives of homogenization or hybridization.  It argues that globalization's effects are complex and contingent, shaped by pre-existing cultural structures, power dynamics, and the specific mechanisms of global interconnectedness.  Adopting an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon anthropology, sociology, and economics, we examine how globalization's economic forces – such as international trade and tourism – interact with cultural practices, impacting everything from traditional art forms and culinary traditions to linguistic diversity and religious beliefs.  We will analyze the tensions between global flows of capital and information and the resilience of local cultural identities, highlighting cases where globalization has fostered cultural adaptation and innovation, as well as instances of cultural loss and appropriation.  Specifically, the presentation will explore the role of digital media in both the dissemination and preservation of local cultures, and discuss the implications for cultural policy and the ethical considerations of cultural exchange in a globalized world. Ultimately, we aim to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the dynamic interplay between global processes and local realities.
