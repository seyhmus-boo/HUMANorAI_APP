The sociology of mental health examines the social construction of mental illness, its prevalence, and its impact on individuals and society. Historically, explanations for mental distress ranged from supernatural attributions to biological reductionism, neglecting the social context.  Early asylums, for example, exemplified societal attempts at managing deviance rather than providing therapeutic care.  

Contemporary sociology emphasizes the social determinants of mental health, exploring how factors like poverty, discrimination, and social support influence mental well-being.  Stigma, a powerful social force, remains a significant barrier to seeking help and achieving recovery.  Moreover, societal structures, including healthcare systems and policies, shape access to treatment and influence outcomes.  The sociological perspective highlights the interplay between individual experiences and broader social structures, emphasizing that mental illness is not solely a medical issue but also a social problem with far-reaching consequences for individuals, families, and communities.  Research in this area informs policy interventions aimed at reducing inequalities and improving mental health outcomes.
