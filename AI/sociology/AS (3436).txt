The pervasiveness of social media in contemporary society necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its impact on human behavior. This research paper explores the multifaceted influence of social media platforms on individual and collective actions, drawing upon an interdisciplinary framework encompassing sociology, psychology, communication studies, and computer science.  While previous research has often focused on isolated aspects, such as addiction or online harassment, this study adopts a broader perspective, examining the interconnected effects of social media on various behavioral domains.  We analyze how algorithms shape information consumption and subsequently impact political polarization,  mental health outcomes, and the formation of social identities.  Further, we investigate the implications of networked communication for the spread of misinformation and the erosion of trust in traditional institutions.  By synthesizing findings from diverse fields, this paper aims to contribute to a more nuanced and holistic comprehension of the complex relationship between social media and human behavior, paving the way for informed interventions and policy recommendations to mitigate potential negative consequences and harness the platformâ€™s positive capabilities.
