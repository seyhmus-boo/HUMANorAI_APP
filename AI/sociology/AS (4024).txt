This presentation examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a narrow focus on purely economic growth metrics often overlooks crucial social dimensions.  We posit that a holistic approach, integrating social indicators into policy formulation and evaluation, is crucial for achieving sustainable and equitable development.  The presentation will analyze the impact of various economic policies – including fiscal policy, monetary policy, and trade liberalization – on key social indicators such as health outcomes, education levels, income inequality, and social cohesion.  We will explore both positive and negative externalities, demonstrating how seemingly beneficial economic growth can exacerbate social inequalities if not carefully managed.  Practical applications will be discussed, focusing on the potential of social impact bonds, conditional cash transfers, and progressive taxation to mitigate negative social consequences and foster inclusive growth.  Furthermore, the limitations of current measurement frameworks and the need for more nuanced data collection will be highlighted, emphasizing the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration to develop more effective and socially responsible economic policies.
