This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures. While globalization fosters interconnectedness and economic growth, its effects on cultural preservation are complex and often contested.  We argue that globalization acts as a double-edged sword, simultaneously promoting cultural exchange and homogenization.  The paper explores the mechanisms through which globalization, particularly through media, tourism, and transnational corporations, influences cultural practices, beliefs, and identities.  We analyze both the positive aspects, such as increased cultural awareness and opportunities for cross-cultural dialogue, and the negative, such as the erosion of traditional languages and customs, and the dominance of globalized cultural products.  

Practical applications stemming from this research include informing strategies for cultural preservation and promoting sustainable tourism. By understanding the specific impacts of globalization on vulnerable cultural groups, policymakers and community leaders can develop effective interventions. These may range from supporting local artisans and traditional art forms through targeted funding and marketing initiatives to implementing educational programs that foster intercultural understanding and pride in local heritage.  Ultimately, the presentation aims to foster a nuanced understanding of globalizationâ€™s complex relationship with local cultures, and to highlight the crucial role of proactive measures in mitigating negative impacts and celebrating cultural diversity.
