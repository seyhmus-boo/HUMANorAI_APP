The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a complex and multifaceted issue demanding an interdisciplinary approach.  While traditional economics primarily focuses on GDP growth and efficiency, a holistic understanding necessitates incorporating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science.  Studies reveal that purely growth-oriented policies, neglecting distributional effects and social safety nets, often exacerbate inequality and undermine well-being, as evidenced by rising poverty amidst economic expansion.  Conversely, policies prioritizing social inclusion, such as universal basic income or robust social security systems, demonstrate positive correlations with improved mental health, reduced crime rates, and enhanced social cohesion, findings supported by sociological and psychological research.  Political science contributes by analyzing the influence of power dynamics and institutional frameworks on policy implementation and its impact on diverse social groups.  Therefore, a comprehensive assessment of economic policies requires moving beyond narrow economic indicators to incorporate multi-dimensional measures of well-being, acknowledging the intricate interplay between economic structures and social outcomes.  Future research should prioritize interdisciplinary collaborations to develop more effective and equitable policies that truly enhance societal well-being.
