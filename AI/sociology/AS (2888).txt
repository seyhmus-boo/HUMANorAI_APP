This presentation examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change.  While acknowledging the inherent complexities and varied outcomes of collective action, the analysis focuses on the mechanisms through which movements effect transformative shifts in social norms, policies, and power structures.  We explore the interplay between movement mobilization strategies, framing processes, and the broader socio-political context in shaping their efficacy.  Specific attention is given to the impact of digital technologies on movement organization, communication, and reach, considering both their empowering and potentially limiting effects.  Furthermore, the presentation considers the concept of "success" within the context of social movements, challenging simplistic notions of victory and defeat, and highlighting the enduring legacy of movements even when their initial goals remain unachieved.  Case studies drawn from diverse historical and contemporary examples will illustrate the diverse pathways through which movements contribute to both incremental and radical societal transformations, emphasizing the ongoing relevance of studying their dynamics and impact. The presentation concludes by outlining future research avenues for better understanding the conditions conducive to successful movement mobilization and sustained social change.
