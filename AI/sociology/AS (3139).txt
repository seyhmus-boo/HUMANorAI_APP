This presentation examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change.  Drawing upon a comparative analysis of diverse movements across historical periods and geographical contexts, it argues that while the success of social movements is contingent upon various factors, including resource mobilization, framing strategies, and the broader political landscape, their inherent capacity to challenge existing power structures and generate alternative discourses remains a significant catalyst for transformation.  The presentation will explore different theoretical frameworks, including resource mobilization theory and framing theory, to analyze the mechanisms through which social movements achieve their goals, ranging from policy reforms to shifts in cultural norms and values.  Specific examples will be drawn from movements focused on civil rights, environmental protection, and LGBTQ+ rights to demonstrate the varied strategies employed and outcomes achieved.  Ultimately, the presentation aims to highlight the enduring significance of social movements as agents of societal change, emphasizing their capacity to both disrupt existing power dynamics and generate innovative solutions to pressing social problems.  The discussion will conclude by considering the challenges and limitations inherent in social movement activism and proposing avenues for future research.
