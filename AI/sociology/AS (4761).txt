This paper investigates the complex and multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being. While economic growth is often posited as a primary driver of improved social outcomes, the nature and extent of this relationship remain contested.  We argue that a simplistic correlation between GDP growth and social well-being overlooks crucial mediating factors such as income inequality, access to healthcare and education, environmental sustainability, and social safety nets.  This research employs a multi-faceted approach, drawing on both quantitative and qualitative data to analyze the impact of specific economic policies – including fiscal policy, monetary policy, and trade liberalization – on a range of social well-being indicators.  We examine diverse national contexts to account for variations in institutional frameworks and cultural influences, thereby moving beyond a purely economistic perspective.  Our findings challenge the assumption of a direct and linear relationship, highlighting the importance of policy design and implementation in achieving equitable and sustainable social progress. Ultimately, this study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of how economic policies can be strategically leveraged to enhance social well-being, rather than solely focusing on aggregate economic growth.
