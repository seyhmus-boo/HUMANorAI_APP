This presentation examines the evolving landscape of gender roles in contemporary societies, moving beyond simplistic binary understandings.  We analyze the interplay of societal, economic, and technological factors that have driven significant shifts in expectations and behaviors associated with masculinity and femininity.  While traditional gender roles persist in many contexts, we argue that a multifaceted process of negotiation and contestation is underway, shaped by diverse social movements, changing family structures, and increasing workforce participation by women.  The presentation will explore the complexities of this evolution, considering both progress and persistent inequalities. We will analyze the impact of globalization and technological advancements on gender norms, specifically focusing on the uneven distribution of opportunities and the persistence of gendered divisions of labor.  Furthermore, we will address the ongoing challenges of achieving gender equality, highlighting the limitations of current policies and suggesting avenues for future research and intervention. The analysis draws upon diverse theoretical frameworks, including intersectionality and feminist theories of power, to offer a nuanced perspective on the ongoing transformation of gender roles in the 21st century.
