Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and goals, play a crucial role in effecting societal change.  This paper examines the mechanisms through which movements influence societal structures and norms.  Success hinges on factors including movement mobilization, framing of grievances, resource mobilization, and the strategic interaction with state and counter-movement actors.  While some movements achieve significant policy changes through institutional channels, others engage in disruptive tactics, challenging dominant power structures and generating broader social transformations.  The paper analyzes the interplay between movement tactics, political opportunity structures, and the resultant societal impacts, highlighting the contingent nature of success.  Furthermore, it addresses the enduring legacies of movements, both positive (e.g., expanded civil rights) and negative (e.g., the exacerbation of social divisions).  Examining diverse case studies, from the Civil Rights Movement to contemporary climate activism, reveals the complex and multifaceted relationship between social movements and the dynamic process of societal change.  Future research should focus on the evolving role of digital technologies and transnational networks in shaping movement dynamics and effectiveness.
