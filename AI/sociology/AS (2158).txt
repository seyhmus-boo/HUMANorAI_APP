This presentation examines the persistent and evolving nature of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on contemporary society.  Recent developments, particularly the exacerbation of existing disparities by the COVID-19 pandemic and the accelerating impact of automation, warrant renewed scrutiny.  We will explore how these factors have disproportionately affected lower socioeconomic groups, leading to widening gaps in health outcomes, educational attainment, and economic opportunities.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the burgeoning literature on the social and political consequences of rising inequality, including increased social unrest, political polarization, and erosion of social cohesion.  Specifically, we will consider the role of neoliberal policies and globalization in shaping these trends, drawing on empirical data from recent studies.  Finally, we will briefly discuss emerging policy debates surrounding wealth redistribution, social safety nets, and the need for more inclusive economic models aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects of class inequality and fostering a more equitable society.  The presentation will conclude by highlighting areas requiring further research and policy intervention.
