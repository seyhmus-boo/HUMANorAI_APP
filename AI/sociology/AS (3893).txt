This presentation explores the evolving role of education in shaping social norms, focusing on recent developments in pedagogical theory and practice.  Traditional models emphasized transmission of established norms, but contemporary scholarship increasingly recognizes education's capacity to foster critical consciousness and promote social change.  Recent research highlights the efficacy of participatory pedagogies, which empower learners to actively engage in constructing and negotiating norms, fostering greater ownership and internalization.  Furthermore, the integration of technology offers new avenues for disseminating information and fostering dialogue surrounding evolving societal expectations, particularly regarding issues such as inclusivity and sustainability.  However, challenges remain.  Inequities in access to quality education perpetuate existing social divisions, hindering the potential for education to act as a truly transformative force.  This presentation will analyze these recent advancements, highlighting both the successes and limitations of education in shaping socially equitable and just norms, and will propose avenues for future research and policy interventions to maximize its positive impact.  We will discuss the implications for curriculum development and teacher training in fostering critical thinking and responsible citizenship.
