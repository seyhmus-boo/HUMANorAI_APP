Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, continues to shape contemporary social structures and outcomes in profound ways.  While historical analyses have extensively documented its manifestations, recent developments necessitate a renewed examination of its multifaceted effects. This paper argues that the intensifying global economic disparities, fueled by technological advancements and neoliberal policies, are exacerbating existing inequalities and generating novel forms of social stratification.  Recent research highlights a widening gap not only in wealth and income but also in access to crucial resources like quality education, healthcare, and political representation.  Furthermore, the impact extends beyond individual economic well-being, impacting social cohesion, political stability, and even public health outcomes.  This study will explore these evolving dynamics, drawing on contemporary data and theoretical frameworks to analyze the mechanisms through which class inequality perpetuates itself and generates broader societal consequences. Specifically, we will investigate the interplay between economic disparities, social mobility, and political polarization, examining the implications for social justice and policy interventions.  The analysis will contribute to a deeper understanding of the challenges inherent in addressing class inequality in the 21st century.
