This presentation addresses the significant experimental challenges in researching class inequality and its societal effects. While observational studies readily demonstrate correlations between socioeconomic status and various outcomes (health, education, crime), establishing causal links remains elusive due to the inherent complexities of class as a multidimensional construct.  We discuss the limitations of traditional experimental designs, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), in capturing the longitudinal and cumulative effects of class inequality, particularly across generations.  Issues of sample selection bias, the difficulty in manipulating class status ethically and realistically, and the confounding influence of other socio-demographic factors are critically examined.  We propose avenues for overcoming these limitations, including the integration of quasi-experimental methods such as regression discontinuity designs and instrumental variables, coupled with qualitative data to enrich the understanding of mechanisms.  Furthermore, we advocate for a shift towards more nuanced experimental designs that account for the dynamic interplay between individual agency and structural constraints in shaping class-based outcomes, ultimately fostering a more robust and nuanced understanding of this pervasive societal issue.
