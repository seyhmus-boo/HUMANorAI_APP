This presentation examines the evolving role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on recent developments and shifting dynamics. While traditional models emphasized mobilization around singular issues, contemporary movements often exhibit greater fluidity and interconnectedness, leveraging digital technologies for mobilization and narrative construction.  We explore the rise of transnational activism, exemplified by climate justice and Black Lives Matter movements, highlighting the challenges and opportunities presented by networked activism across geographical and cultural boundaries.  Furthermore, the presentation analyzes the increasing influence of counter-movements and the strategies employed to resist or co-opt social change agendas.  We will discuss the impact of algorithmic amplification and targeted disinformation campaigns on movement efficacy, and the consequent need for adaptable strategies in navigating increasingly complex information environments.  Finally, we consider the lasting impact of successful movements, examining instances of policy reform and institutional change, as well as the persistence of systemic inequalities despite apparent progress.  The presentation concludes by proposing avenues for future research in understanding the complex interplay between social movements, technology, and lasting societal transformation.
