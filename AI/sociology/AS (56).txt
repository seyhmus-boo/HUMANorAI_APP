This presentation explores the sociological dimensions of mental health, examining how social structures and processes shape both the experience and treatment of mental illness.  We move beyond a purely biomedical model to consider the social determinants of mental health, encompassing factors like socioeconomic status, social support networks, and cultural contexts.  The presentation will analyze how societal inequalities manifest as disparities in access to care, diagnosis, and treatment outcomes for different social groups.  Specific attention will be given to the stigmatization of mental illness and its impact on individuals' lives, including employment prospects, social relationships, and self-esteem.  Furthermore, we examine the role of social movements and advocacy groups in challenging societal perceptions and advocating for policy changes that promote mental well-being.  The presentation concludes by discussing the implications of a sociological understanding of mental health for developing more effective and equitable mental health policies and interventions, emphasizing the need for a holistic approach that integrates social, psychological, and biological perspectives.  We argue that a truly comprehensive approach requires addressing the social roots of mental distress alongside individual-level treatments.
