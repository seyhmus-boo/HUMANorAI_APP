This presentation examines the ongoing evolution of gender roles in contemporary societies, focusing on recent developments that challenge traditional binary frameworks.  While significant progress has been made towards gender equality, entrenched societal norms continue to shape expectations and opportunities differentially across genders.  We will explore the impact of  feminist movements and LGBTQ+ activism on shifting perceptions of masculinity and femininity, highlighting the increasing acceptance of gender fluidity and non-binary identities.  Furthermore, we will analyze the influence of economic factors, including changing labour market dynamics and increased female participation in traditionally male-dominated fields, on the renegotiation of domestic responsibilities and power structures within households.  The presentation will also address the persistence of gender pay gaps, occupational segregation, and underrepresentation in leadership positions, acknowledging the complexities and unevenness of gender equality advancements.  Finally, we will consider the role of technology and social media in both reinforcing and challenging traditional gender roles, illustrating the multifaceted and dynamic nature of this ongoing societal transformation.
