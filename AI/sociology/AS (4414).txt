The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being constitutes a critical area of inquiry demanding interdisciplinary analysis.  While traditionally examined through the lens of economics, a holistic understanding necessitates integrating perspectives from sociology, political science, psychology, and public health.  This paper explores the multifaceted connections between macroeconomic strategies, such as fiscal and monetary policies, and their impact on various dimensions of social well-being, including health outcomes, educational attainment, social equity, and environmental sustainability. We move beyond a purely utilitarian assessment of GDP growth to acknowledge the complex interplay between economic indicators and subjective measures of happiness, life satisfaction, and social cohesion.  This interdisciplinary approach allows us to scrutinize the distributional effects of economic policies, examining how benefits and burdens are unevenly allocated across different social groups, and to assess the longer-term societal consequences of short-term economic gains.  Ultimately, we argue that a truly effective economic policy framework requires a nuanced appreciation of its social ramifications, embracing an integrated perspective to achieve sustainable and equitable well-being for all.
