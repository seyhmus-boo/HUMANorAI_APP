Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on class inequality and its societal ramifications.  While class stratification has always existed, recent decades have witnessed a stark resurgence, evidenced by widening wealth gaps globally and increased intergenerational immobility. This burgeoning inequality has profound consequences.

Firstly, it undermines social cohesion.  Extreme disparities foster resentment and distrust, potentially leading to social unrest and political polarization.  Secondly, it severely impacts health outcomes.  Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality, attributable to factors like limited access to healthcare and increased stress.  Thirdly, economic inequality stifles innovation and productivity.  Concentrated wealth limits opportunities for social mobility, preventing talent from flourishing across the socioeconomic spectrum.

Recent developments, including automation and globalization, have exacerbated these trends.  While technological advancements offer potential benefits, their uneven distribution further entrenches inequality. Similarly, globalization, while promoting economic growth, often disproportionately benefits the wealthy, leaving behind vulnerable populations. Addressing these challenges requires multifaceted interventions, ranging from progressive taxation to investments in education and social safety nets.  Only through concerted efforts can we mitigate the damaging effects of escalating class inequality.
