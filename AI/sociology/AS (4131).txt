The relationship between economic policies and social well-being has been a central theme in economics and social sciences since the inception of the discipline.  Historically, laissez-faire policies, dominant from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention, often resulting in stark inequalities and social unrest.  The Great Depression spurred a shift towards Keynesian economics, emphasizing government intervention to stabilize the economy and mitigate social hardship through social safety nets and public works programs.  Subsequent decades witnessed the rise of neoliberal policies, focusing on deregulation, privatization, and free trade, with mixed results regarding social well-being,  leading to debates concerning income inequality and social mobility.  Empirical studies consistently demonstrate a complex, non-linear relationship, where economic growth does not automatically translate to improved well-being across all segments of society.  Factors such as income distribution, access to healthcare and education, environmental quality, and social capital significantly mediate the link between economic policies and population-level well-being.  Future research should focus on developing more nuanced econometric models incorporating these mediating variables to inform the design of effective economic policies that promote both prosperity and equitable social outcomes.
