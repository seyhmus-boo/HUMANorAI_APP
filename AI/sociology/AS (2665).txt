Class inequality, a persistent societal ill, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding.  Sociological research extensively documents the correlation between socioeconomic status and various life outcomes, including health, education, and criminal justice involvement.  Economic analyses reveal the mechanisms perpetuating inequality, from unequal distribution of wealth and resources to discriminatory labor market practices.  Psychological studies highlight the impact of social stratification on individual well-being, mental health, and cognitive development, demonstrating the pervasive influence of class on individual agency.  Furthermore, political science illuminates how class inequality shapes political participation, influencing policy agendas and reinforcing existing power structures.  Critically, historical perspectives are essential for contextualizing contemporary inequalities, tracing their roots in historical events and institutional arrangements.  By integrating insights from these disciplines, a richer understanding of the multifaceted nature of class inequality emerges, revealing its complex and interconnected effects on societal cohesion, social mobility, and overall well-being.  A holistic approach is crucial for developing effective policy interventions to mitigate the pervasive and damaging consequences of class divisions.
