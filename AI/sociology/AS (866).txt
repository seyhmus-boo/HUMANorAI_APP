This paper investigates the complex relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond simplistic correlations to explore nuanced causal pathways. We posit that while economic growth is often cited as a primary indicator of societal progress, its impact on social well-being is mediated by several key factors including income inequality, access to essential services (healthcare, education), and environmental sustainability.  Our analysis, drawing on cross-national data and employing regression models, reveals a non-linear relationship:  rapid, unequally distributed growth can negatively affect well-being, while inclusive growth demonstrably improves indicators such as life satisfaction, health outcomes, and social cohesion.  Specifically, we find strong evidence supporting the positive impact of policies promoting social safety nets, investments in human capital, and environmental protection on diverse measures of social well-being.  These findings have practical applications for policymakers, highlighting the need to move beyond solely GDP-focused strategies and adopt a more holistic approach that prioritizes equitable distribution of resources and sustainable development.  Future research should focus on exploring specific policy instruments and their efficacy in different socio-economic contexts to further refine our understanding and optimize policy design for enhanced social well-being.
