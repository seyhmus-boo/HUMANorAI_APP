This presentation explores the evolving sociological understanding of mental health and its profound social implications.  Historically, societal responses to mental illness have ranged from stigmatization and exclusion – exemplified by the asylum era's institutionalization – to more recent, albeit still imperfect, efforts toward integration and community-based care.  We will examine how dominant societal narratives, shaped by factors such as class, race, and gender, have constructed and influenced understandings of mental distress, impacting access to care, treatment approaches, and individual experiences.

The presentation will analyze key sociological perspectives, including labeling theory, which highlights the social construction of deviance, and the medicalization thesis, which examines the increasing tendency to frame social problems as medical issues.  We will also consider the impact of social inequalities on mental health outcomes, including the disproportionate burden experienced by marginalized groups. Finally, we will discuss the implications of these sociological insights for policy and practice, focusing on the need for de-stigmatization initiatives, equitable access to mental healthcare, and the promotion of social support networks that foster mental well-being within diverse communities.  The aim is to stimulate discussion on how sociological understanding can inform the development of more inclusive and effective mental healthcare systems.
