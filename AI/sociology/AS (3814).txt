Social norms, the unwritten rules governing behavior within a society, are not static entities but are constantly shaped and reshaped by a multitude of factors.  This paper examines the crucial role of education in this dynamic process, arguing that educational institutions are not merely transmitters of knowledge, but active agents in the construction and modification of social norms.  Our investigation draws upon interdisciplinary perspectives, integrating insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and educational studies to offer a nuanced understanding of this complex relationship.  We analyze how formal curricula, pedagogical approaches, and the hidden curriculum – encompassing the informal lessons learned within the educational environment – contribute to the internalization of specific societal values and expectations.  Furthermore, the paper explores how educational access, quality, and the diversity of perspectives represented within educational settings influence the propagation and challenge of existing norms.  By examining case studies and relevant literature, we aim to demonstrate the profound and often multifaceted impact education exerts on the formation, maintenance, and transformation of social norms, ultimately highlighting the significant implications for social progress and equity.
