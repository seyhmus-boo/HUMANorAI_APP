Globalization's impact on local cultures remains a complex and contested area of study.  This review examines existing literature exploring the multifaceted effects of increased interconnectedness on cultural preservation and transformation. While globalization fosters cultural exchange and diffusion, leading to hybridity and innovation, concerns persist regarding the homogenizing influence of dominant global cultures.  Studies indicate that globalization often results in the marginalization or even erosion of indigenous languages, traditions, and practices, particularly in less economically developed regions.  However, a nuanced perspective reveals that local cultures are not passive recipients; they actively adapt, negotiate, and resist global influences, leading to the emergence of unique forms of cultural resilience and hybridity.  The extent of globalization's impact varies significantly depending on factors such as the pre-existing strength of local cultural institutions, the nature of global interactions, and the agency of local communities. Future research should focus on more granular analyses of specific cultural contexts, acknowledging the diverse and dynamic responses to globalization's multifaceted pressures.  The simplistic dichotomy of homogenization versus hybridization fails to capture the complexity of this ongoing process.
