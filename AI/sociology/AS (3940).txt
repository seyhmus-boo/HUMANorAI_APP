Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the persistent challenge of empirically demonstrating the societal effects of class inequality. While the existence of class stratification is readily observable, establishing a direct causal link between inequality and its consequences proves experimentally difficult.  Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard in causal inference, are ethically problematic when manipulating socioeconomic status.  Observational studies, while more feasible, are hampered by confounding variables;  it's challenging to isolate the impact of inequality from other correlated factors like access to education or healthcare.

Furthermore, the multidimensionality of class – encompassing wealth, income, education, occupation, and social capital – complicates analysis.  Studies must account for the complex interplay of these dimensions, leading to analytical complexity and potential biases.  Longitudinal studies are crucial to understanding the intergenerational transmission of inequality and its lasting effects, but these are resource-intensive and prone to attrition bias.  Overcoming these experimental hurdles is paramount to crafting effective social policies that mitigate the detrimental societal consequences of class inequality.
