Class inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across societal strata, significantly impacts societal well-being and stability.  This paper theoretically explores the multi-faceted consequences of this disparity.  High levels of inequality correlate with reduced social mobility, hindering individual advancement and perpetuating intergenerational poverty.  Furthermore,  unequal access to quality education, healthcare, and housing exacerbates existing disparities, creating a self-reinforcing cycle of disadvantage.  The resulting social fragmentation fuels political polarization, eroding social cohesion and trust in institutions. Increased crime rates, poor public health outcomes, and diminished economic productivity are also frequently observed in societies characterized by significant class inequality.  This theoretical framework suggests that addressing class inequality requires comprehensive policy interventions targeting resource redistribution, educational reform, and the creation of more equitable opportunities, thereby fostering a more just and prosperous society.  Further empirical research is needed to fully elucidate the complex interplay between class inequality and its diverse societal impacts.
