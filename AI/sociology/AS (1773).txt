Class inequality, a persistent societal feature throughout history, manifests as the uneven distribution of resources, power, and opportunities based on socioeconomic status.  Historical examples, from feudal systems to industrial capitalism, demonstrate its enduring presence.  The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a minority consistently generates disparities in access to education, healthcare, and political influence.  These disparities are not merely economic; they have profound social ramifications.

High levels of class inequality correlate with reduced social mobility, hindering individuals' ability to transcend their ascribed class position. This stagnation fuels social unrest and political instability, as marginalized groups experience disproportionate rates of poverty, crime, and poor health outcomes.  Furthermore, significant inequality erodes social cohesion, fostering resentment and distrust between different social strata. This ultimately undermines societal stability and potentially contributes to increased social fragmentation and the weakening of democratic institutions.  Addressing class inequality requires comprehensive strategies tackling economic disparities and promoting social justice.
