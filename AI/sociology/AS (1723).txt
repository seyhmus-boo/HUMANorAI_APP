This study investigates the complex relationship between cultural diversity and social integration within multicultural societies.  Drawing on data from [specify data source, e.g., a national survey of X individuals in Y country], we examine the mediating role of intercultural contact and social cohesion on the association between cultural diversity at the neighborhood level and individual-level social integration, operationalized as [specify measure, e.g., subjective well-being, social trust, civic engagement].  Results from multilevel modeling reveal a nuanced relationship; while higher levels of neighborhood diversity are not directly associated with greater social integration,  frequent positive intercultural contact significantly mediates this relationship, leading to enhanced social integration.  Furthermore, strong social cohesion within the neighborhood moderates the positive effect of intercultural contact, suggesting that a supportive social environment amplifies the benefits of diversity.  Our findings highlight the importance of fostering inclusive social environments and promoting opportunities for positive intercultural interactions to leverage the potential benefits of cultural diversity for enhanced social integration. Implications for policy interventions aimed at building cohesive and inclusive communities are discussed.
