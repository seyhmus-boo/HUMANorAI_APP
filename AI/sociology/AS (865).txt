This paper investigates the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a narrow focus on GDP growth to encompass a broader range of societal outcomes. We argue that a robust understanding requires acknowledging the multifaceted nature of well-being, encompassing not only material prosperity but also factors like health, education, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.  The analysis explores the differential impact of various economic policy instruments – including fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies – on these diverse dimensions of social well-being.  We utilize a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of macroeconomic data with qualitative insights derived from case studies of specific policy interventions in developed and developing economies.  Our findings highlight the crucial role of policy design in mediating the relationship between economic growth and social equity. We demonstrate how policies prioritizing inclusivity and sustainability can generate positive spillover effects, enhancing overall societal well-being, while conversely, policies focused solely on maximizing economic growth can exacerbate inequalities and undermine long-term social progress.  The paper concludes by offering recommendations for policy-makers aiming to forge a more equitable and sustainable path to societal flourishing.
