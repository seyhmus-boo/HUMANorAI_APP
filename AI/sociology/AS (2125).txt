Urbanization, the increasing concentration of human populations in cities, profoundly impacts community life, engendering both positive and negative consequences.  This paper explores the theoretical relationship between urbanization and community cohesion, arguing that while increased population density facilitates social interaction and resource sharing, it simultaneously leads to social fragmentation and anonymity.  The transition from primarily rural, kinship-based communities to diverse, urban settings necessitates the formation of new social structures and support systems.  This process can foster innovation and cultural exchange but may also exacerbate social inequality and erode traditional social bonds.  We posit a theoretical framework highlighting the mediating role of urban design and governance in shaping community outcomes.  Effective urban planning, including the provision of public spaces and community services, can mitigate the negative impacts of urbanization, fostering stronger, more inclusive urban communities. Conversely, inadequate planning exacerbates existing social cleavages, leading to decreased social capital and heightened social problems.  Further research is needed to investigate the nuanced interplay of these factors across diverse urban contexts.
