The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being forms a central concern in contemporary socio-economic research.  While economic growth is often touted as a primary indicator of societal progress, its impact on various dimensions of well-being, including health, education, and social equity, remains a subject of ongoing debate. This paper investigates the multifaceted nature of this relationship, exploring how specific economic policies – encompassing fiscal, monetary, and social welfare measures – influence societal well-being indicators. We move beyond a simple correlation analysis to examine the mediating factors and potential causal mechanisms at play, acknowledging the diverse contexts and varying policy effectiveness across different socio-political landscapes.  The practical applications of this research are significant, offering valuable insights for policymakers aiming to design effective strategies for inclusive and sustainable development.  By understanding the nuanced interplay between economic choices and social outcomes, governments can better target interventions to maximize positive impacts on citizens’ lives, ultimately contributing to more equitable and prosperous societies. This study will therefore contribute to a more robust understanding of this complex interplay, informing policy decisions and promoting evidence-based approaches to social and economic development.
