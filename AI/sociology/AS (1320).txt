This presentation examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a narrow focus on purely economic indicators neglects crucial aspects of societal health.  We posit that a holistic approach, integrating social considerations into economic decision-making, is vital for achieving sustainable and equitable development.  The presentation will explore the impact of various policy instruments – including taxation, social safety nets, and investment in human capital – on key indicators of social well-being such as health, education, and social inclusion.  We will analyze both the direct and indirect effects of these policies, considering potential trade-offs and unintended consequences.  Practical applications will be discussed through case studies showcasing examples of successful policy interventions that positively impact social well-being alongside economic growth, such as conditional cash transfer programs and investments in early childhood development.  Furthermore, we will highlight the importance of participatory policy-making, emphasizing the need for inclusive data collection and the engagement of diverse stakeholders to ensure policies effectively address the needs of all segments of society.  The presentation concludes by emphasizing the critical need for a paradigm shift towards a more integrated and socially conscious approach to economic policy formulation.
