The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a complex and enduring subject of scholarly debate. Historically, laissez-faire economics, dominant from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, prioritized economic growth with minimal government intervention, often at the expense of social equity.  The resulting inequalities fueled social unrest and spurred the rise of welfare states in the post-World War II era.  Keynesian economics, advocating government intervention to manage aggregate demand and mitigate economic downturns, became influential, prioritizing full employment and social safety nets.  However, the latter half of the 20th century saw a resurgence of neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and privatization, with varying impacts on social well-being.

Empirical evidence suggests a correlation between economic growth and certain dimensions of well-being, such as increased life expectancy and reduced poverty. However, the distribution of this growth remains crucial.  Inequality, often exacerbated by policies favoring capital over labor, can undermine social cohesion and even negate the positive effects of economic expansion.  Therefore, a critical assessment requires considering not only GDP growth but also indicators like income distribution, access to healthcare and education, and social mobility.  Future research should focus on nuanced analyses of specific policy interventions and their long-term effects on diverse social groups, recognizing the multifaceted nature of social well-being.
