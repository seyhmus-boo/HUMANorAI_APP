Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, transcends disciplinary boundaries, impacting various facets of human experience.  Sociologists highlight the perpetuation of inequality through inherited wealth, access to education, and occupational segregation, leading to disparities in income, health, and life expectancy. Economists analyze the mechanisms – such as regressive tax policies and minimum wage stagnation – that exacerbate wealth concentration at the top, diminishing social mobility.  Furthermore, political scientists examine how class inequality shapes political participation, influencing policy outcomes and potentially leading to social unrest.  Critically, psychologists explore the psychological consequences of inequality, including increased stress, reduced well-being, and the fostering of prejudice and discrimination.  The interdisciplinary nature of this issue underscores the need for multifaceted approaches, integrating sociological understandings of social structures with economic analyses of resource distribution and psychological insights into individual impact to effectively address this complex societal problem.
