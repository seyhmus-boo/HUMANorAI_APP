This paper investigates the multifaceted role of education in shaping and transforming social norms.  While the transmission of cultural values through education is widely acknowledged, the precise mechanisms and extent of its influence remain areas of ongoing debate.  This research examines how formal and informal educational settings contribute to the internalization and reinforcement of prevailing social norms, as well as their potential to facilitate norm change.  We analyze existing literature across sociological, anthropological, and psychological perspectives, focusing on the interplay between curriculum content, pedagogical approaches, peer interactions, and broader societal contexts.  Specifically, the study explores how education can both perpetuate existing inequalities through the reinforcement of discriminatory norms and, conversely, act as a catalyst for progressive social change by fostering critical thinking, empathy, and a commitment to inclusive values.  Empirical evidence from diverse educational systems will be examined to assess the effectiveness of various educational interventions aimed at influencing social norms related to gender equality, environmental sustainability, and intergroup relations.  Ultimately, this paper aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of education's complex and often contradictory role in the dynamic process of norm construction and evolution.
