This presentation examines the persistent and pervasive impact of class inequality on societal structures and outcomes.  Historically, class stratification, while manifesting differently across eras and geographies, has been a fundamental feature of human societies, from ancient agrarian systems to contemporary capitalist economies.  Early forms, often rooted in land ownership and feudal relationships, have evolved into more complex systems characterized by disparities in wealth, income, access to resources, and social capital.

Drawing on sociological and economic literature, this presentation will explore the multifaceted effects of this enduring inequality.  We will analyze its contribution to decreased social mobility, impacting individualsâ€™ life chances and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the detrimental effects on public health, education attainment, and political participation, ultimately undermining social cohesion and democratic ideals.  Evidence will be presented to illustrate how class disparities contribute to increased crime rates, social unrest, and political polarization.  Finally, the presentation will briefly consider potential strategies for mitigating class inequality and promoting a more equitable society, highlighting the challenges and complexities involved in addressing this deeply entrenched social issue.
