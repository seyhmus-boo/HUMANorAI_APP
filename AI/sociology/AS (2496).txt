This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in studying the impact of urbanization on community life.  While the broad trends of social atomization and decreased civic engagement in denser urban environments are widely acknowledged, isolating the causal mechanisms and quantifying their effects remains complex.  Traditional sociological methods, like surveys, often struggle to capture the nuanced and dynamic nature of community interaction in diverse urban settings.  We discuss the limitations of existing methodologies, highlighting the difficulties in establishing robust control groups and accounting for the confounding effects of socioeconomic status, ethnicity, and pre-existing social networks.  The presentation will then propose a novel mixed-methods approach, combining agent-based modelling with ethnographic fieldwork, to address these experimental hurdles.  Specifically, we detail the development of an agent-based model simulating community formation and interaction within different urban density scenarios, validated against empirical data gathered through participant observation and qualitative interviews in selected urban neighbourhoods.  This integrated approach aims to provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between urbanization and community well-being, paving the way for more targeted and effective urban planning strategies.
