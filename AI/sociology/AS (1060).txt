Social movements, collective actions aimed at challenging or maintaining power structures, are pivotal agents of societal change.  Their impact transcends single disciplines, requiring an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding.  Sociology examines movement mobilization, framing processes, and resource mobilization, analyzing the social networks and organizational structures underpinning collective action. Political science investigates the relationship between movements and the state, exploring strategies of influence, including lobbying, protest, and civil disobedience, and their impact on policy outcomes.  History provides crucial context, illuminating long-term trajectories of social change and the historical precedents shaping current movements.  Anthropology contributes insights into cultural meanings and identities, revealing how movements draw upon and reshape cultural frameworks.  Furthermore, psychology explores the individual motivations and collective identities that drive participation, while economics analyzes the economic impacts of movements, both on participants and on wider society.  By integrating these perspectives, a richer understanding emerges of the complex interplay of factors shaping social movements' success and their consequential role in societal transformation.
