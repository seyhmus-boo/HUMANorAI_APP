Good morning. Today's lecture examines the pervasive impact of social media on human behaviour, focusing on recent developments.  While early research highlighted the potential for increased social connection, current scholarship reveals a more nuanced picture.  Recent studies demonstrate a correlation between excessive social media use and heightened anxiety, depression, and body image issues, particularly amongst adolescents.  This is partly attributed to the curated, often unrealistic, portrayals of life prevalent on platforms.

Furthermore, the algorithmic amplification of echo chambers and filter bubbles contributes to polarization and the spread of misinformation.  Studies tracking online behaviour reveal a concerning rise in online harassment and cyberbullying, facilitated by the anonymity and scale offered by social media.  Finally, the addictive nature of these platforms, driven by sophisticated notification systems and reward mechanisms, warrants significant attention.  Further research is crucial to understand the long-term consequences of these behavioural shifts and to develop effective mitigation strategies.
