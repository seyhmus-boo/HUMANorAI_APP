This presentation explores the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a narrow focus on purely economic indicators inadequately captures the multifaceted nature of societal progress.  We posit that effective social well-being necessitates a holistic approach encompassing not only economic growth but also equitable distribution of resources, access to quality healthcare and education, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion.  The analysis will examine various policy instruments, including fiscal policy, monetary policy, and social welfare programs, evaluating their impact on key well-being dimensions.  Specific examples will be drawn from comparative case studies, contrasting the outcomes of different policy approaches across developed and developing nations.  The presentation will critically assess the effectiveness of neoliberal economic models in promoting social well-being, highlighting instances of increased inequality and social fragmentation despite robust economic growth.  Finally, we propose a framework for policy formulation that prioritizes both economic efficiency and social equity, advocating for a more nuanced understanding of the interdependence between economic prosperity and the broader societal good.  The implications for future policy design and evaluation will be discussed.
