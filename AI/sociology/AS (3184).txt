Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the complex interplay between cultural diversity and social integration, specifically focusing on the experimental challenges in researching this dynamic.  While intuitively, greater diversity might hinder integration, empirical evidence is far from conclusive.  Experimental studies face significant methodological hurdles.  Firstly, defining and measuring "integration" itself proves problematic.  Is it solely based on intergroup contact, or does it encompass shared values, social cohesion, and economic equality?  Secondly, controlling for confounding variables like pre-existing social inequalities and individual personality traits poses a significant challenge.  Randomly assigning participants to diverse or homogeneous environments ethically problematic.  Further, longitudinal studies, necessary to capture long-term integration outcomes, are resource-intensive.  Finally, the Hawthorne effect – participants altering their behaviour due to awareness of being observed – can significantly skew results.  Overcoming these methodological obstacles is crucial for developing robust understandings of the relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, ultimately informing more effective policies.
