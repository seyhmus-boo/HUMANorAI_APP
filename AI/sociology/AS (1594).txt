Education plays a multifaceted role in shaping and perpetuating social norms. This presentation explores the mechanisms through which educational institutions and curricula influence societal values and behaviors. We argue that education acts not only as a transmitter of existing norms but also as a catalyst for social change.  The analysis examines the curriculum's explicit and implicit transmission of norms, considering the impact of pedagogy, teacher-student interactions, and the broader school environment.  Furthermore, we investigate the influence of educational attainment on individualsâ€™ attitudes and behaviours, exploring the correlation between levels of education and adherence to specific social norms, such as gender roles, environmental responsibility, or political participation. We utilize a mixed-methods approach, drawing on sociological theories of socialization and empirical data from existing literature and potentially original research findings [depending on the actual research].  The presentation will ultimately argue that while education can reinforce existing inequalities, it also possesses significant potential to challenge ingrained norms and foster a more equitable and just society.  By understanding the complex interplay between education and social norms, we can develop more effective strategies to promote positive social change through educational interventions.
