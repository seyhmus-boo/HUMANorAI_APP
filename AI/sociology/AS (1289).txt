Cultural diversity, analogous to a complex ecosystem, significantly impacts social integration, the process akin to the establishment of a stable, functioning biome.  While diversity offers a rich array of resources and perspectives – similar to biodiversity enhancing ecosystem resilience – its influence on social integration is multifaceted and not inherently positive.  Unmitigated differences, like invasive species disrupting a delicate balance, can lead to social fragmentation and conflict, hindering the development of a cohesive social structure.  Effective integration, comparable to successful ecological succession, requires mechanisms facilitating intercultural understanding and cooperation. This necessitates bridging social distance, analogous to creating corridors connecting fragmented habitats, through initiatives promoting intergroup contact, mutual respect, and equitable resource allocation, mirroring the management of keystone species to maintain ecological stability.  Our review suggests that policies fostering inclusive environments and celebrating cultural hybridity, akin to promoting symbiotic relationships within an ecosystem, are crucial for maximizing the benefits of diversity while mitigating its potential negative consequences on social integration.  Further research should focus on identifying specific mechanisms to foster positive intergroup interactions and promote a truly integrated society.
