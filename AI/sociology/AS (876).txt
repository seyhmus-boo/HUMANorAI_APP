This presentation explores the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on society, drawing upon interdisciplinary insights from sociology, economics, political science, and psychology.  We argue that class inequality, extending beyond simple economic disparity, manifests as a complex web of interconnected social, political, and psychological disadvantages.  Sociological perspectives will examine how class structures perpetuate themselves through mechanisms such as inherited wealth, educational disparities, and occupational segregation.  Economic analyses will highlight the impact on economic growth, productivity, and social mobility, emphasizing the concentration of wealth and the widening income gap.  Furthermore, we will explore the political consequences, including reduced democratic participation, the erosion of social trust, and the influence of money in politics.  Finally, psychological research will be integrated to illuminate the effects of socioeconomic status on individual well-being, mental health, and cognitive development. By integrating these diverse perspectives, we aim to demonstrate the far-reaching and interconnected nature of class inequality, highlighting its profound impact on individual lives and societal structures, and ultimately advocating for a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding to inform effective policy interventions.
