This presentation examines the complex and evolving relationship between economic policies and social well-being, tracing its historical trajectory from laissez-faire economics to contemporary welfare state models.  Historically, prioritizing economic growth often came at the expense of social equity, as exemplified by the Industrial Revolutionâ€™s stark inequalities.  Classical economic theories, while emphasizing efficiency, largely neglected the social consequences of unchecked capitalism, leading to widespread poverty and social unrest.  The 20th century witnessed a shift, with the rise of Keynesian economics and the establishment of welfare states in many developed nations. These interventions, aiming to mitigate market failures and ensure a social safety net, demonstrably improved aspects of social well-being, such as health and education outcomes.  However, recent decades have seen a resurgence of neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and austerity, raising concerns about the potential erosion of social protections and widening inequalities.  This presentation will critically analyze the historical interplay between economic policy choices and their impact on various dimensions of social well-being, including income distribution, health, education, and social cohesion, offering a framework for understanding the ongoing debate regarding the optimal balance between economic growth and social justice.  The presentation concludes by considering the challenges and opportunities for designing economic policies that effectively promote both economic prosperity and social well-being in the 21st century.
