Social movements have consistently played a pivotal role in driving societal transformation, challenging existing power structures and advocating for significant policy shifts.  This presentation examines the evolving dynamics of social movements in the 21st century, focusing on recent developments and their impact on societal change.  We will explore the increasingly interconnected nature of movements facilitated by digital technologies, analyzing how online mobilization strategies, alongside traditional tactics, influence both the scale and reach of activism.  The presentation will also consider the impact of globalization on the formation and evolution of transnational social movements, highlighting cases where localized struggles coalesce into broader global campaigns for social justice.  Further, we will analyze the shifting relationship between social movements and the state, exploring instances of both collaboration and repression, and the consequent implications for achieving lasting societal change. Finally, the presentation will discuss emerging trends, such as the rise of identity-based movements and the increasing importance of intersectionality, arguing that a nuanced understanding of these complexities is crucial for analyzing the continued efficacy and impact of social movements in shaping the future.
