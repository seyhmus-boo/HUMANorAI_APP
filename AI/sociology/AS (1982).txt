The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has long been a subject of intense debate and research, yet a comprehensive understanding remains elusive. This paper explores this complex interplay, moving beyond traditional economic paradigms to integrate insights from sociology, political science, and psychology.  While economic growth is often posited as a primary driver of improved social well-being, measured through metrics like life expectancy, education levels, and social cohesion, the causal link is far from straightforward.  Distributional effects of economic policies, for instance, are crucial:  growth concentrated in the hands of a few may not translate into widespread improvements in well-being, potentially exacerbating inequality and social unrest.  Furthermore, the impact of specific policies, such as taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulations, varies significantly depending on contextual factors, requiring an interdisciplinary lens to account for social norms, political power dynamics, and individual psychological responses. This research undertakes an interdisciplinary analysis, examining how different theoretical frameworks illuminate the multifaceted dimensions of this relationship and ultimately contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the conditions under which economic policies foster – or hinder – societal well-being.
