This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being through a novel lens: quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate fields, we argue that the principles of superposition and entanglement offer valuable insights into the complex, interconnected nature of socioeconomic systems. Traditional economic models often treat individual agents as independent, classical entities. However, we propose that social well-being, encompassing factors like health, education, and social cohesion, is a superposition of various contributing factors, exhibiting emergent properties not readily predictable from individual components alone.  Economic policies, in this framework, act as interventions that influence the probabilities of different "well-being states" through entanglement of social and economic variables. For example, investment in education (a policy) entangles individual human capital with societal productivity, influencing the overall probability of achieving a high-well-being state.  This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of policy effectiveness, highlighting the potential for unforeseen consequences arising from seemingly localized interventions. We will discuss how quantum-inspired computational methods could improve the prediction and modelling of these complex interactions, ultimately leading to more effective policy design for enhanced social well-being.
