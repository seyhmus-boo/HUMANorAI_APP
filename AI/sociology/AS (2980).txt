Class inequality, a persistent societal ill, significantly impacts various social determinants of health and well-being.  This lecture explored the multi-faceted nature of this inequality, encompassing disparities in income, wealth, access to resources (education, healthcare, housing), and social capital.  The consequences, far-reaching and interconnected, include diminished social mobility, increased crime rates, poorer health outcomes across multiple indicators (life expectancy, infant mortality), and exacerbated political polarization.  The concentration of wealth at the top perpetuates a cycle of disadvantage, limiting opportunities for upward mobility and fostering resentment among marginalized groups.  Furthermore, inequality undermines social cohesion, fostering distrust in institutions and hindering collective action necessary for addressing societal challenges.  Addressing class inequality requires multifaceted strategies, including progressive taxation, investment in social safety nets, and policies promoting equitable access to quality education and healthcare, ultimately fostering a more just and equitable society.
