Education's role in shaping social norms is a subject of ongoing scholarly investigation, with recent developments highlighting its complex and multifaceted nature.  While traditionally viewed as a transmitter of existing norms, contemporary research emphasizes education's capacity to both reinforce and challenge societal expectations.  Curricula, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment significantly influence students' values, beliefs, and behaviors.  

Recent studies utilizing longitudinal data demonstrate the enduring impact of educational interventions designed to promote prosocial behaviors, such as tolerance and empathy, indicating a sustained shift in social norms.  Conversely, the persistence of inequalities within educational systems underscores how education can inadvertently perpetuate existing social divisions and reinforce discriminatory norms.  The rise of digital learning presents both opportunities and challenges, with online platforms potentially facilitating the dissemination of both positive and negative social influences.  Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay between educational practices, technological advancements, and their evolving impact on the formation and transformation of social norms.  The focus must be on developing inclusive and equitable educational approaches that actively promote positive social change.
