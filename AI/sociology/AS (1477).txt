This paper examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond simplistic correlations to explore nuanced causal pathways.  While economic growth often serves as a proxy for societal progress,  the distributional effects of policies significantly mediate their impact on well-being.  We argue that focusing solely on macroeconomic indicators like GDP overlooks crucial dimensions of social well-being, including health, education, and environmental sustainability.  Policies aimed at enhancing human capital, through investment in education and healthcare, demonstrably improve social well-being, even if short-term economic growth is marginally affected.  Conversely, neoliberal policies prioritizing deregulation and austerity, while potentially boosting certain economic metrics, may exacerbate social inequalities and diminish overall well-being, especially for vulnerable populations.  The study advocates for a multi-dimensional approach to policy evaluation, incorporating qualitative and quantitative data to capture the complex interplay between economic outcomes and social indicators.  A more holistic framework is needed, prioritizing equitable distribution of resources and opportunities to achieve sustainable and inclusive social well-being alongside economic prosperity.
