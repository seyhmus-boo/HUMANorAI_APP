Globalization, from a quantum mechanical perspective, can be viewed as a superposition of cultural states.  Prior to significant globalization, local cultures existed in relatively isolated, eigenstates, characterized by distinct observable cultural traits.  The interaction of these eigenstates, facilitated by increased interconnectedness, introduces entanglement.  This entanglement leads to a probabilistic superposition; local cultural elements become entangled with global trends, resulting in a complex, non-local cultural wave function.  The "measurement" of this wave function, representing the observation of cultural expression, collapses the superposition into a hybridized state.  However, the degree of entanglement, and therefore the extent of cultural hybridization, is not uniform. Some local cultures, possessing a strong cultural "potential" (intrinsic resilience), exhibit greater resistance to collapse, retaining a stronger eigenstate character. Others, with weaker potential, exhibit a more pronounced collapse, resulting in significant cultural homogenization.  The ultimate state of any given local culture, therefore, is a dynamic equilibrium, a continuous interplay between global and local influences determined by its intrinsic properties and the strength of the globalizing "field."
