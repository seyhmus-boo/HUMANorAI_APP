Globalization's impact on local cultures remains a complex and intensely debated topic. This presentation examines recent developments in this ongoing process, moving beyond simplistic narratives of homogenization versus fragmentation.  We argue that globalization fosters a nuanced interplay, generating both cultural convergence and divergence.  Recent research highlighting the rise of "glocalization" – the adaptation of global trends to local contexts – will be central to our analysis. We will explore case studies demonstrating how globalized media, technology, and migration simultaneously challenge and reinforce local cultural practices. For example, the appropriation and reinterpretation of global pop music styles within indigenous musical traditions reveal a dynamic negotiation between global and local elements, creating hybrid cultural forms.  Conversely, we will consider instances where globalization exacerbates cultural commodification and the erosion of traditional practices due to economic pressures.  The presentation concludes by emphasizing the need for a critical understanding of power dynamics inherent in global cultural flows, advocating for research that transcends binary oppositions and explores the multi-faceted and often contradictory effects of globalization on local cultural landscapes.
