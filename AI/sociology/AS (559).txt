This paper investigates the complex relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simple correlation to explore nuanced causal pathways.  We posit that the impact of economic policies on social well-being is mediated by several factors, including income distribution, access to essential services (healthcare, education), and social safety nets.  Using a comparative analysis of OECD nations over the past two decades, we employ panel data regression models to assess the relative contributions of various policy instruments – such as progressive taxation, minimum wage legislation, and social welfare spending – to key indicators of social well-being, encompassing life expectancy, self-reported happiness, and income inequality.  Our findings suggest that while economic growth is a necessary but insufficient condition for improved social well-being, policies aimed at equitable income distribution and robust social safety nets are strongly associated with positive outcomes.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of specific policies varies significantly across different socio-economic contexts, highlighting the importance of context-specific policy design.  These findings underscore the need for a more holistic approach to economic policymaking, prioritizing social equity alongside economic growth to achieve sustainable improvements in societal well-being.
