This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, focusing on both individual and societal levels.  We analyze existing literature exploring the effects of social media usage on mental health, examining the correlation between platform engagement and indicators such as anxiety, depression, and body image dissatisfaction.  Furthermore, the presentation investigates the influence of social media algorithms and echo chambers on information consumption and political polarization.  We consider how curated online personas contribute to social comparison and the potential for both enhanced social connection and increased social isolation.  The presentation will also touch upon the ethical implications of data collection and targeted advertising, and their role in shaping user behavior and preferences.  Finally, we synthesize existing research to highlight key areas requiring further investigation, specifically emphasizing the need for longitudinal studies that assess long-term impacts across diverse demographics.  The overall aim is to provide a critical overview of social media's influence on human behavior and encourage further interdisciplinary research to mitigate potential negative consequences.
