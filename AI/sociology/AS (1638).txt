Education plays a crucial role in shaping social norms, acting as a conduit for the transmission and transformation of cultural values and beliefs. This paper explores the multifaceted relationship between education and social norm formation through an interdisciplinary lens, integrating insights from sociology, psychology, and anthropology.  We posit that education's influence transcends the mere dissemination of factual knowledge; it cultivates critical thinking, fostering individuals' capacity to evaluate existing norms and potentially challenge or reformulate them.  Social learning theory highlights the importance of observational learning within educational settings, where students internalize norms modeled by teachers and peers.  Further, the curriculum itself, implicitly and explicitly, conveys societal values, reinforcing or challenging pre-existing norms around gender roles, ethnicity, and environmental responsibility.  Anthropological studies underscore the variability of norms across cultures, emphasizing education's role in both preserving and altering cultural practices.  Analysis of educational outcomes reveals a correlation between increased educational attainment and shifts in social attitudes, though the precise mechanisms require further investigation.  This interdisciplinary approach underscores the significance of education as a powerful agent of social change, capable of both perpetuating and transforming societal norms.
