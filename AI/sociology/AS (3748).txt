Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, continues to exert profound and multifaceted effects on social structures and individual well-being. This paper examines the pervasive influence of class disparities on key societal outcomes, moving beyond a purely economic lens to encompass social, political, and health dimensions.  We argue that class inequality is not merely a distributional issue, but rather a fundamental driver of social stratification with far-reaching consequences.  The analysis draws upon existing sociological, economic, and epidemiological literature to synthesize current understanding and highlight critical research gaps.  Specifically, we investigate the impact of class inequality on educational attainment, health disparities, political participation, and social cohesion. We explore the mechanisms through which class inequality perpetuates itself across generations, examining the roles of inherited wealth, access to resources, and institutional biases.  Finally, we discuss potential policy interventions aimed at mitigating the detrimental effects of class inequality and fostering a more equitable and just society. The paper concludes by emphasizing the urgent need for comprehensive and multidisciplinary research to address this persistent and deeply consequential social problem.
