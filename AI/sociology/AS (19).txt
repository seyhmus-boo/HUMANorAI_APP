This presentation explores the intricate and often contested relationship between economic policies and social well-being, tracing its evolution through historical contexts.  Early economic thought, exemplified by laissez-faire capitalism, prioritized economic growth with limited consideration for equitable distribution of its benefits, often leading to significant social disparities. The 20th century witnessed a shift, with the rise of Keynesian economics advocating for government intervention to mitigate economic cycles and promote full employment, thereby indirectly influencing social well-being.  However, the limitations of this approach, particularly regarding income inequality and environmental sustainability, became increasingly apparent.

More recently, debates have centered on alternative models, including social democratic approaches emphasizing welfare state provisions and inclusive growth strategies. This presentation will analyze empirical evidence examining the impact of diverse economic policy choices – such as taxation, social welfare spending, and labor market regulations – on key indicators of social well-being, encompassing health, education, and life satisfaction.  The discussion will highlight the complexities of establishing causal links and the importance of considering contextual factors.  Ultimately, the presentation argues for a more nuanced understanding of the trade-offs inherent in economic policy decisions and the crucial need to prioritize social well-being alongside economic growth for the creation of truly sustainable and just societies.
