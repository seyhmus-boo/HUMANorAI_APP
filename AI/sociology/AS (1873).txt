The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a complex and multifaceted area demanding an interdisciplinary approach.  While traditional economics focuses on aggregate indicators like GDP, a holistic understanding necessitates integrating perspectives from sociology, psychology, and political science.  Studies consistently demonstrate that purely growth-oriented policies, neglecting distributive justice and social equity, often fail to translate into improved well-being.  For example, rising income inequality, a frequent byproduct of neoliberal policies, negatively impacts social cohesion and mental health, as evidenced by sociological research on social capital and psychological studies on stress and inequality.  Furthermore, political science illuminates how policy implementation and public perception, shaped by power dynamics and societal values, significantly influence actual outcomes.  Effective policies require considering the interplay of economic mechanisms with social structures, individual agency, and political processes.  A genuinely interdisciplinary lens is crucial for designing and evaluating policies aimed at achieving not only economic growth but also demonstrable improvements in societal well-being, encompassing factors such as health, education, and environmental sustainability.  Future research should prioritize integrated methodologies to bridge the gap between economic models and the lived realities of diverse populations.
