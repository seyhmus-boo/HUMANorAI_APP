This paper investigates the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a narrow focus on GDP growth to encompass a broader range of indicators.  We argue that while economic growth is a necessary but insufficient condition for enhanced social well-being, the specific design and implementation of economic policies significantly shape societal outcomes.  The analysis employs a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of macroeconomic data across diverse national contexts with qualitative insights gleaned from case studies focusing on specific policy interventions.  Key policy areas examined include taxation, social welfare provision, and labor market regulations.  Our findings suggest a non-linear relationship, where certain economic policies, particularly those emphasizing inclusive growth and social safety nets, demonstrably correlate with improved indices of well-being such as health, education, and social inclusion. Conversely, policies prioritizing unrestrained market liberalization or austerity measures often exhibit negative or uneven impacts on social well-being, particularly for vulnerable populations.  The paper concludes by highlighting the critical need for policy frameworks that explicitly prioritize social equity and sustainability alongside economic growth, advocating for a more holistic and multidimensional approach to economic policymaking.
