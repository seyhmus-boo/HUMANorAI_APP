This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a purely growth-focused approach is insufficient to guarantee societal flourishing.  We posit that economic policies are akin to a gardener tending a garden:  GDP growth represents the yield, but social well-being encompasses the entire ecosystem.  Focusing solely on maximizing yield (GDP) risks neglecting crucial elements such as soil health (environmental sustainability), biodiversity (social equity), and pest control (crime and inequality).  Just as a monoculture, while yielding high short-term returns, leaves the garden vulnerable to disease, an overemphasis on economic growth without considering social factors can lead to societal fragility.  Conversely, a holistic approach, akin to permaculture, prioritizes the long-term health of the ecosystem â€“ fostering resilience through diverse elements and sustainable practices.  We will examine specific policy examples, illustrating how prioritizing social safety nets, environmental protection, and equitable distribution of resources, though potentially impacting short-term growth figures, ultimately contributes to a more robust and sustainable form of social well-being, creating a thriving garden rather than a high-yield monoculture.  This analysis highlights the necessity of integrating social considerations into economic policymaking to achieve genuine and sustainable societal prosperity.
