This presentation explores the evolving field of the sociology of mental health, focusing on recent developments and their broader social implications.  We move beyond individualistic models of mental illness, examining how social structures, inequalities, and cultural contexts shape mental health experiences and outcomes.  Recent research highlights the significant impact of social determinants of health, such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of social support, on mental health prevalence and severity.  We will discuss the growing body of work exploring the social construction of mental illness, emphasizing how diagnostic categories and treatment approaches are influenced by social norms and power dynamics.  Furthermore, the presentation will address emerging research on the role of social media and digital technologies in shaping mental health, both positively and negatively.  Finally, we will examine the implications of these sociological insights for policy and practice, advocating for a more socially just and equitable approach to mental health care that addresses the root causes of mental distress and promotes social inclusion.  The presentation will conclude by suggesting avenues for future research to further illuminate the complex interplay between society and mental well-being.
