The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has been a central theme in economic and social thought for centuries.  Historically, laissez-faire capitalism, prevalent from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention, often resulting in stark inequalities and social unrest.  The Great Depression exposed the fragility of this approach, prompting the rise of Keynesian economics, which emphasized government intervention to stabilize the economy and mitigate unemployment, thus indirectly bolstering social well-being.

Subsequent decades saw a shift towards neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and privatization. While proponents argued these policies stimulated economic growth, critics highlighted increased income inequality and a decline in social safety nets, raising concerns about their impact on overall social well-being.  Contemporary scholarship increasingly emphasizes a more nuanced perspective, recognizing that economic growth is not automatically synonymous with social well-being.  Factors like income distribution, access to healthcare and education, environmental sustainability, and social cohesion are crucial determinants of a thriving society.  Effective policies must therefore consider a broader range of social indicators alongside purely economic measures to achieve genuine and sustainable improvements in societal well-being.  Future research needs to explore the complex interplay of these factors and develop policy interventions that effectively balance economic efficiency and social justice.
