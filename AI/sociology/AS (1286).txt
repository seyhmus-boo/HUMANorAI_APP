This presentation explores the role of education in shaping social norms through a novel lens: quantum mechanics.  Traditional sociological models often treat norm adoption as a deterministic process.  However, we propose that individual beliefs and behaviors, crucial components of norm formation, exhibit characteristics analogous to quantum superposition and entanglement.  Prior to education, an individual may hold multiple, potentially conflicting, beliefs in superposition, representing a probabilistic landscape of potential future actions.

Education acts as a "measurement" process, collapsing this superposition.  The curriculum, teaching methods, and social environment within the educational setting influence the probability of specific norms being adopted, akin to manipulating the wave function in quantum systems.  Furthermore, interactions between students—the entanglement of beliefs and behaviors—amplify the effect of education, leading to cascading norm shifts within peer groups.  We argue that understanding this quantum-inspired framework allows for a more nuanced analysis of educational efficacy in promoting desirable social changes.  By acknowledging the probabilistic nature of belief formation and the interconnectedness of individual perspectives, we can design more effective educational interventions capable of facilitating shifts in social norms, mitigating harmful behaviors, and fostering positive societal transformations.  This presentation will outline this theoretical framework and discuss its potential implications for educational policy and practice.
