Good morning. Today's lecture addresses class inequality and its societal ramifications.  Imagine a marathon where some runners start at the starting line, others a kilometer behind, and a few are not even permitted to enter the race. This disparity mirrors class inequality: unequal access to resources and opportunities based on social stratification.  These resources—education, healthcare, and financial capital—are the "training" for the marathon of life.  Those starting behind face an uphill battle, resulting in a skewed distribution of "finishing times," manifested in disparities in wealth, health outcomes, and social mobility.

This inequality isn't simply an issue of fairness; it has profound societal effects.  A society with extreme class divides is akin to a building with a weak foundation: prone to social unrest, political instability, and diminished overall well-being.  The "strong" floors, representing the affluent, might remain stable, but the cracks and vulnerabilities in the lower floors, representing the disadvantaged, threaten the whole structure's integrity.  Addressing class inequality, therefore, isn't merely a moral imperative; it is crucial for societal stability and progress.  It requires dismantling systemic barriers and promoting equitable access to the resources necessary for all members of society to thrive.
