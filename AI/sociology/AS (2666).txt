This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, tracing its trajectory from early instances of cross-cultural exchange to its contemporary, accelerated form. Historically, cultural diffusion occurred through trade routes, migration, and conquest, resulting in gradual adaptation and syncretism. However, the post-World War II era witnessed an unprecedented intensification of globalization, driven by technological advancements and neoliberal economic policies. This accelerated interconnectedness, while fostering economic growth and cultural exchange, simultaneously poses significant challenges to local cultural identities.  We will explore the contrasting perspectives on this phenomenon, analyzing both the homogenizing effects of global media and consumerism, which threaten cultural diversity, and the processes of cultural hybridity and resistance that emerge as local cultures adapt and reinterpret global influences.  Specific examples will be drawn from diverse geographical contexts to illustrate how globalization differentially impacts various communities, highlighting both the loss of traditional practices and the creative dynamism that can arise from cultural interaction.  The presentation concludes by considering potential strategies for promoting cultural preservation and sustainability in an increasingly globalized world.
