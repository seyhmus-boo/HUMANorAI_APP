The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being remains a central focus of both theoretical and empirical economic research. While macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth often serve as proxies for societal prosperity, a comprehensive understanding requires a nuanced examination of the distributional effects of policies and their impact on diverse aspects of well-being, including health, education, and social cohesion. This paper explores the challenges inherent in establishing robust causal links between specific economic policies and social well-being outcomes, focusing on the limitations of traditional observational studies.  The inherent endogeneity of economic policies, often determined by complex interplay of factors, renders isolating their independent effects a formidable task.  Furthermore, the multifaceted nature of social well-being presents significant measurement challenges, requiring the integration of subjective and objective indicators, which are often subject to biases and inconsistencies.  This research highlights the critical role of experimental methods, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and natural experiments, in mitigating these challenges. We discuss the practical limitations and ethical considerations associated with implementing such experiments, particularly within the context of large-scale socio-economic interventions, and propose avenues for future research incorporating innovative methodologies to enhance causal inference in this complex field.
