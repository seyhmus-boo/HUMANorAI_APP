Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and perpetuating, or challenging and transforming, societal norms.  Like a potter shaping clay, educational systems mold individuals' beliefs and behaviors through the curriculum, pedagogy, and the social environment of the learning institution.  The curriculum itself acts as a blueprint, explicitly transmitting societal values and expectations, often implicitly reinforcing existing power structures. For instance, the historical narratives presented can solidify dominant narratives, while the omission of certain perspectives can reinforce societal biases.  Furthermore, pedagogical approaches, such as teacher-student interactions and classroom dynamics, can subtly shape norms of acceptable behavior, deference to authority, and collaborative engagement.  Analogous to a garden, the school environment cultivates specific social norms through rewards and sanctions, peer interaction, and the creation of a shared social identity.  The social norms established within the educational setting, whether promoting inclusivity and critical thinking or perpetuating conformity and obedience,  then extend beyond the classroom, influencing individuals' participation in wider society. Thus, education acts as both a reflector and a refractor of social norms, capable of reinforcing existing structures or fostering the seeds of societal change.
