Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, exerts profound and multifaceted effects on societal well-being. This paper examines the empirical evidence linking socioeconomic disparities to a range of negative social outcomes.  Analysis reveals a strong correlation between class inequality and reduced social mobility, hindering individual advancement and perpetuating intergenerational poverty.  Furthermore, higher levels of inequality are associated with increased crime rates, poorer health indicators across multiple dimensions (physical, mental, and reproductive), and lower levels of social trust and civic engagement.  These effects are mediated through mechanisms such as unequal access to quality education, healthcare, and housing, as well as the concentration of political power in the hands of the affluent.  The data supports the hypothesis that significant socioeconomic disparities not only exacerbate existing social problems but also actively contribute to the creation of new ones, ultimately undermining social cohesion and hindering sustainable development.  Future research should focus on targeted interventions aimed at mitigating inequality's detrimental effects and fostering more equitable societies.
