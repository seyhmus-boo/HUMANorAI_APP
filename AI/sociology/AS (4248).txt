This presentation examines the pivotal role of education in shaping and reshaping social norms.  We argue that educational institutions, beyond the transmission of knowledge and skills, function as significant agents of socialization, actively influencing societal values, beliefs, and behaviors.  The analysis considers multiple levels of influence, including the explicit curriculum (e.g., civics, history, health education), the implicit curriculum (e.g., school culture, disciplinary practices), and the broader societal context in which schools operate.  We explore how educational policies and pedagogical approaches can either reinforce existing norms or foster progressive social change.  Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of various educational strategies in promoting tolerance, inclusivity, and responsible citizenship.  The presentation will critically evaluate case studies illustrating both the positive and negative impacts of education on the development and evolution of social norms, considering the interplay between formal and informal learning environments.  Ultimately, we aim to highlight the considerable potential of education as a powerful tool for social engineering, emphasizing the ethical considerations inherent in its capacity to influence societal values and behaviors.
