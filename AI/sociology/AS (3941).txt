Social media's rapid proliferation since the early 2000s has profoundly impacted human behavior, necessitating interdisciplinary investigation.  Early research focused on the affordances of online communication, examining its potential for enhancing social connection and information dissemination. However, more recent studies highlight a complex interplay of positive and negative consequences.  While social media facilitates social capital formation and community building, particularly for marginalized groups, concerns remain regarding its impact on mental health.  Studies consistently link heavy social media use to increased anxiety, depression, and body image issues, potentially exacerbated by curated online personas and social comparison.  Furthermore, the spread of misinformation and the echo chamber effect contribute to polarized societal attitudes and erode trust in established institutions.  Algorithmic amplification of content further shapes individual information consumption and reinforces pre-existing biases.  Future research should focus on nuanced understandings of the differential impacts across demographics and platforms, investigating the interplay between individual vulnerabilities, platform design, and societal contexts to mitigate the negative consequences and harness the beneficial potential of social media.
