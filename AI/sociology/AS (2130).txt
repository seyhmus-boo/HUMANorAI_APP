The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, demanding an interdisciplinary approach encompassing economics, sociology, political science, and public health.  While traditional economic models prioritize GDP growth as a proxy for well-being, a more nuanced understanding necessitates considering broader social indicators.  For instance, policies focused solely on macroeconomic stability might exacerbate income inequality, negatively impacting social cohesion and mental health (sociology/public health).  Similarly,  deregulatory policies aimed at boosting market efficiency can lead to environmental degradation and health risks, highlighting the crucial link between environmental economics and public health.  Political science contributes by analyzing the distributional effects of policies, revealing how power dynamics influence policy design and implementation, impacting access to resources like healthcare and education.  An interdisciplinary framework, therefore, emphasizes the need for evaluating economic policies not solely on their impact on aggregate economic indicators but also on their distributional consequences across different social groups and their impact on various dimensions of social well-being, such as health, education, and environmental sustainability.  Ignoring these interdependencies risks creating economic growth at the expense of social progress.
