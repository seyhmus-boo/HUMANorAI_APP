Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, play a crucial role in effecting societal change.  While traditionally understood through the lens of large-scale, geographically concentrated mobilization, recent developments highlight the evolving nature of these movements.  The rise of digital technologies has profoundly impacted mobilization strategies, enabling rapid dissemination of information and the formation of transnational networks, as evidenced by the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements.  These digitally facilitated movements demonstrate a shift from hierarchical structures to decentralized, networked organization, allowing for greater inclusivity and responsiveness to evolving demands.  However, this digital landscape also presents challenges, including the spread of misinformation and the vulnerability to state-sponsored surveillance and repression.  Furthermore, the success of social movements in achieving meaningful policy changes remains contested, with the impact often contingent upon factors such as existing power structures, media representation, and the capacity for sustained mobilization.  Consequently, contemporary scholarship increasingly focuses on analyzing the intersection of digital activism,  shifting power dynamics, and the long-term consequences of movement activity on institutional structures and societal norms.
