This presentation examines the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, advocating for a more interdisciplinary approach to policymaking.  While traditional economic models often prioritize GDP growth, a holistic understanding necessitates incorporating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science. We argue that solely focusing on macroeconomic indicators overlooks crucial dimensions of well-being, including social cohesion, mental health, and environmental sustainability.  The presentation explores how policies designed to stimulate economic growth, such as austerity measures or deregulation, can have unintended and often negative consequences on social equity and individual well-being. Conversely, we analyze the potential of policies prioritizing social justice, such as universal basic income or robust social safety nets, to positively impact not only individual well-being but also broader economic stability. Drawing on empirical evidence from diverse sources, we illustrate the interconnectedness of economic and social outcomes, demonstrating the need for integrated policy frameworks that explicitly consider their mutual influence.  Ultimately, we propose a framework for integrating interdisciplinary knowledge to design more effective and equitable economic policies that genuinely promote social well-being.
