This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a simplistic cause-and-effect model is insufficient.  We propose a more nuanced understanding, drawing on biological and ecological analogies.  Consider the human body: economic policies are akin to the body's systems (e.g., circulatory, digestive).  A solely growth-focused policy, prioritizing GDP analogous to maximizing caloric intake, neglecting other systems (healthcare, education – representing social well-being), can lead to imbalance and dysfunction (e.g., obesity or organ failure).  Similarly, an ecosystem analogy highlights the interconnectedness of various factors.  Economic activity, like a species within an ecosystem, thrives within certain parameters. Overexploitation (unfettered capitalism) or neglect (severe austerity) can disrupt ecological balance, analogous to harming social cohesion and environmental sustainability, both vital components of well-being.  We will argue that sustainable social well-being requires a holistic approach, mirroring a healthy body or a balanced ecosystem. This involves carefully calibrated economic policies that consider not just economic growth, but also equitable distribution, environmental protection, and investment in human capital – ensuring all systems function synergistically for collective prosperity.  Empirical evidence will be presented to support this integrated perspective.
