Good morning. Today's lecture considers social movements through a, perhaps unexpected, lens: quantum mechanics. While seemingly disparate, parallels exist.  Social movements, like quantum systems, exhibit emergent properties absent in individual actors.  Individual beliefs, analogous to individual particles, exist in a superposition of states – undecided, uncertain.  However, through interaction and resonance –  protests, collective action, shared narratives – a coherent wave function emerges, representing the movement's overall momentum and direction.

This collective wave function is not deterministic; it's subject to unpredictable fluctuations influenced by external factors (government response, media coverage), mirroring the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena.  Critical mass, a threshold akin to quantum tunneling, is required to overcome societal inertia.  Once achieved, the movement's influence, like a wave collapsing into a measured state, significantly alters the societal landscape.  This alteration, however, is not a simple linear progression; feedback loops and subsequent interactions cause further entanglement and evolution, making the long-term impact complex and difficult to predict precisely.  The study of social movements, therefore, necessitates an approach acknowledging this inherent complexity and probabilistic nature of collective action.
