The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a central concern for policymakers and researchers alike. While intuitive connections exist – for example, between employment rates and individual well-being – establishing robust causal links remains a significant challenge.  This paper explores the inherent difficulties in empirically evaluating this complex relationship, focusing on the limitations of traditional observational studies and the methodological complexities of experimental approaches.  Existing econometric techniques often struggle to account for confounding variables and endogeneity, leading to biased estimates of policy impacts.  Furthermore, the ethical and logistical hurdles inherent in large-scale randomized controlled trials (RCTs) – the gold standard for causal inference – significantly constrain their applicability to policy evaluations in this domain.  We examine the specific challenges posed by issues like spillover effects, non-compliance, and the difficulty in accurately measuring multifaceted aspects of social well-being, such as subjective happiness, social cohesion, and health outcomes.  Ultimately, this paper argues for a multi-method approach, integrating rigorous quasi-experimental designs with qualitative insights to advance our understanding of how economic policies shape social well-being in a nuanced and reliable manner.
