This presentation examines the intricate and often contested relationship between economic policies and social well-being, tracing its evolution through historical lenses.  Historically, laissez-faire economics, dominant from the 18th century onwards, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention, often leading to stark inequalities and neglecting social welfare. The consequences, exemplified by the vast disparities of the Gilded Age and the social unrest preceding the New Deal, demonstrate the limitations of a purely growth-focused approach.

The 20th century witnessed a shift towards Keynesian economics, advocating for government intervention to manage aggregate demand and mitigate economic cycles.  This paradigm, while successfully promoting employment and social safety nets in many instances, also faced criticisms regarding potential inflationary pressures and bureaucratic inefficiencies.  More recently, neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and privatization have generated considerable debate, with their impact on social well-being varying considerably across different contexts and remaining a subject of ongoing scholarly investigation.

This presentation will analyze these historical trajectories, focusing on key policy shifts and their demonstrable effects on various indicators of social well-being, including income inequality, health outcomes, and educational attainment.  It argues that a nuanced understanding of this relationship necessitates moving beyond simplistic correlations, acknowledging the complex interplay of political, social, and cultural factors mediating the impact of economic policies on society.
