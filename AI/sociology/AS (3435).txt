This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, focusing on the inherent methodological challenges in empirically studying such a complex phenomenon.  While globalization's homogenizing effects are often discussed anecdotally, rigorous quantitative and qualitative research encounters significant obstacles.  Establishing causality between globalization processes (e.g., increased trade, migration, media flows) and cultural shifts is difficult due to the presence of numerous confounding variables and the inherent difficulty in isolating the influence of globalization from other socio-economic factors.

Furthermore, measuring cultural change itself presents a significant challenge.  Traditional ethnographic methods, while rich in qualitative data, lack the generalizability needed for broad claims about globalization's impact. Conversely, quantitative surveys often oversimplify complex cultural practices and risk imposing external frameworks on diverse lived experiences.  This presentation will critically examine existing research methodologies, highlighting the limitations of both quantitative and qualitative approaches.  It will propose a mixed-methods strategy that integrates large-scale survey data with in-depth qualitative case studies to address these challenges, arguing for a more nuanced and context-specific understanding of globalization's impact on local cultures.  Finally, it will discuss the ethical considerations inherent in studying cultural change in a globalized world.
