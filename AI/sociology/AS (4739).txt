Globalization's impact on local cultures can be viewed through a quantum mechanical lens, not as a deterministic process of homogenization, but as a superposition of states.  Prior to significant globalization, a culture existed in a relatively isolated, relatively "pure" state, akin to a localized wave function.  The onset of globalization introduces entanglement; global flows of information, goods, and people create interconnectedness, superposing the original cultural state with external influences. This entanglement isn't simply additive; it generates interference patterns, resulting in novel cultural expressions that are neither purely "local" nor purely "global."  The degree of interference, and thus the resulting cultural hybridity, depends on the strength of globalization's influence, analogous to the magnitude of a quantum interaction.  Stronger global forces, such as mass media and multinational corporations, exert a greater influence, potentially leading to a collapse of the wave function toward a more globally homogenized state.  Conversely, strong local resistance, akin to decoherence, can maintain the integrity of the original cultural state, preserving its distinct characteristics.  However, even in cases of significant resistance, the system never fully returns to its pre-globalization isolation; the subtle imprint of entanglement persists, creating a modified, yet still uniquely identifiable, cultural expression.
