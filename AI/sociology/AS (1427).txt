Class inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across societal strata, significantly impacts societal stability and well-being. This paper theorizes that heightened class inequality generates a cascading effect of negative consequences.  Firstly, it fosters social stratification, limiting social mobility and creating a rigid class system characterized by intergenerational transmission of disadvantage.  Secondly, it exacerbates health disparities, as lower socioeconomic groups experience poorer health outcomes due to limited access to healthcare and increased exposure to environmental hazards.  Thirdly, it fuels political instability through increased social unrest and decreased political participation amongst marginalized groups.  Finally, economic inequality undermines overall economic productivity by limiting human capital development and hindering aggregate demand.  Reducing class inequality requires multi-faceted policy interventions focusing on equitable access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities, alongside progressive taxation and robust social safety nets.  Further research should investigate the specific mechanisms driving these relationships and evaluate the efficacy of various policy interventions in mitigating the societal harms of class inequality.
