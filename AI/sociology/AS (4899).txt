This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of rapid urbanization on community life, focusing on recent developments in social cohesion and spatial interaction.  While urbanization offers economic opportunities and improved infrastructure, its effects on social fabric are complex and often contested.  Recent research highlights a growing disconnect between community members, driven by increased residential mobility, diverse populations, and the rise of digital communication which, while connecting globally, can isolate locally.  We analyze how the physical structure of newly urbanized areas – characterized by high-density housing and fragmented public spaces – influences social interactions and the formation of strong community bonds.  Furthermore, we explore the role of urban planning initiatives in mitigating negative consequences, focusing on the effectiveness of place-making projects, community-led initiatives, and policies aimed at fostering social inclusion and reducing inequality.  Finally, we discuss emerging challenges, such as the impact of climate change adaptation strategies on community resilience and the potential for technological solutions to enhance community engagement in rapidly evolving urban landscapes.  The presentation will conclude by suggesting avenues for future research focusing on sustainable and socially equitable urban development.
