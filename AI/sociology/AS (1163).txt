Education plays a crucial role in shaping and perpetuating, or challenging and altering, social norms.  Like a gardener cultivating a garden, educational institutions cultivate societal values and beliefs.  The curriculum, pedagogical approaches, and even the unspoken rules within schools function as the tools used in this cultivation.  Explicitly taught subjects, such as history and civics, can shape understandings of appropriate behavior, justice, and societal roles, acting as the seeds planted in fertile ground.  However, the hidden curriculum—the implicit lessons learned through classroom dynamics, interactions with peers, and the overall school culture—serves as the soil itself, influencing attitudes and behaviors in subtle yet powerful ways.  This hidden curriculum, much like the unseen microorganisms in the soil, can either nourish the growth of positive social norms or contribute to the propagation of harmful stereotypes and inequalities.  Furthermore,  educational institutions act as a social mixer, bringing individuals from diverse backgrounds together. This interaction, akin to the cross-pollination of different plant species, can foster tolerance and understanding or exacerbate existing social divisions, depending on the environment and the effectiveness of inclusive practices.  Thus, education's impact on social norms is multifaceted and extends beyond the explicitly stated learning objectives.  It is a complex process involving both overt instruction and subtle socialization that significantly molds individual and collective attitudes and behaviors.
