This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, highlighting the crucial contributions of interdisciplinary research.  While increased cultural diversity presents significant opportunities for societal enrichment, it also poses challenges to achieving cohesive social integration. We argue that a holistic understanding requires moving beyond simplistic narratives of either conflict or harmony.  Drawing upon insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and political science, we examine the mediating role of various factors – including institutional policies, social networks, intergroup contact, and individual attitudes – in shaping integration outcomes.  The presentation analyzes empirical evidence demonstrating how inclusive policies, promoting intercultural dialogue and understanding, can foster positive intergroup relations and reduce prejudice.  Conversely, we discuss how exclusionary practices and discriminatory ideologies can exacerbate social fragmentation.  By emphasizing the interconnectedness of these disciplines, we aim to showcase the complexity of social integration in diverse societies and advocate for interdisciplinary approaches to developing effective strategies for promoting inclusive and equitable communities.  The discussion will conclude with implications for policymakers and future research directions.
