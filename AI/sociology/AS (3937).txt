This review examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, focusing on the multifaceted nature of this connection beyond simple GDP growth metrics.  While conventional economic wisdom often prioritizes growth as a primary indicator of societal progress,  a growing body of literature emphasizes the limitations of this approach.  This review synthesizes research demonstrating the critical role of redistributive policies, such as progressive taxation and robust social safety nets, in mitigating inequality and enhancing overall well-being.  Furthermore, it explores the impact of investment in human capital (education and healthcare) and infrastructure on social outcomes, highlighting the long-term benefits of such expenditures.  Conversely, the detrimental effects of austerity measures and neoliberal policies on social cohesion and health are critically assessed.  The review concludes that a holistic approach, moving beyond solely economic growth indicators and incorporating measures of social inclusion, health, and environmental sustainability, is crucial for evaluating the effectiveness of economic policies and achieving genuine social well-being.  Future research should focus on developing more nuanced and integrated models that capture the complex dynamics between economic policies and their impact on various dimensions of human flourishing.
