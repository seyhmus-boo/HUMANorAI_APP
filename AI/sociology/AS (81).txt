Social media's pervasive influence on contemporary society necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its impact on human behavior. This research explores the multifaceted ways in which social media platforms shape individual actions and interactions, drawing on insights from diverse academic disciplines.  While initial studies focused primarily on the psychological effects of online interaction, a more nuanced perspective requires an interdisciplinary approach.  This paper integrates sociological perspectives on social capital, community formation, and identity construction with psychological analyses of self-esteem, mental health, and information processing biases.  Furthermore, it considers the implications of algorithmic design and datafication through a computational social science lens, highlighting the role of technological architecture in shaping user behavior.  By weaving together these perspectives, we aim to move beyond simplistic narratives of social media's impact, offering a more complex and nuanced understanding of its effects on various aspects of human behavior, from individual well-being to broader societal trends. This integrated approach allows for a richer interpretation of the intricate interplay between technology, individual agency, and social context.
