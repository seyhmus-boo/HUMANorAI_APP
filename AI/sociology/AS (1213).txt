The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a complex and enduring theme in social science. Historically, laissez-faire economics, dominant from the 18th century, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention, often resulting in stark inequalities and social unrest.  The Industrial Revolution exemplified this, showcasing vast wealth creation alongside widespread poverty and poor working conditions.  The subsequent rise of welfare states in the 20th century represented a significant shift.  Policies like social security, unemployment benefits, and progressive taxation aimed to mitigate economic inequality and enhance social well-being through a more interventionist approach.

However, the precise nature of this relationship remains debated.  While policies promoting full employment and income redistribution demonstrably improve certain aspects of well-being, such as health and education outcomes, others argue that excessive government intervention can stifle economic growth and lead to unintended consequences.  Recent trends, including globalization and increasing automation, further complicate this relationship, requiring a nuanced understanding of how economic policies can be effectively designed to promote both prosperity and social justice.  Empirical research consistently highlights the crucial role of inclusive growth, aiming to distribute the benefits of economic expansion widely across the population.
