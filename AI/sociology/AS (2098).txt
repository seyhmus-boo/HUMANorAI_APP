Class inequality, a persistent societal feature, exerts profound and multifaceted effects across various societal domains. This paper summarizes the extant literature examining the relationship between class stratification and its consequences, focusing on the amplification of existing disparities.  Empirical evidence consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and access to quality education, healthcare, and housing, thereby perpetuating intergenerational cycles of disadvantage.  Furthermore, class inequality fosters social instability, contributing to higher crime rates, increased political polarization, and diminished social cohesion.  The concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a privileged few undermines democratic principles and facilitates the erosion of social trust.  While economic growth may not inherently alleviate inequality, targeted interventions such as progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and investments in human capital development are crucial for mitigating its negative consequences.  Further research should explore the nuanced mechanisms through which class inequality impacts specific demographic groups and investigate the effectiveness of diverse policy approaches aimed at fostering greater equity and social justice.
