This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a simplistic view of economic growth as a sole indicator of societal progress is inadequate.  We posit that economic policies are akin to a gardener tending a complex ecosystem:  unfettered growth, represented by aggressive fertilization (e.g., deregulation), may yield immediate, albeit unsustainable, blooms (GDP growth), while neglecting the soil health (social safety nets, equitable distribution of wealth) leads to eventual collapse.  Conversely, a solely "organic" approach (extreme social welfare programs without economic incentives), analogous to leaving the garden to its own devices, may result in stunted growth and vulnerability to external shocks.

Optimal social well-being, we argue, requires a nuanced approach, balancing economic stimulation with social justice.  This is comparable to a gardener employing both careful fertilization and pest control (addressing inequality and market failures) to foster a thriving and resilient ecosystem. The presentation will utilize examples from different socio-economic contexts to illustrate the complex interplay between policy choices – from taxation and welfare provision to infrastructure investment and trade liberalization – and the resulting impacts on key indicators of social well-being, such as health, education, and social cohesion.  Ultimately, we advocate for a holistic perspective, integrating economic strategies with social considerations to achieve sustainable and equitable progress.
