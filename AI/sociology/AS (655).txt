Social movements, characterized by collective action aimed at challenging existing power structures and effecting societal change, remain a critical area of sociological inquiry. This paper examines the multifaceted roles social movements play in driving transformations across diverse societal domains.  While past scholarship has often focused on individual movement characteristics or specific historical case studies, this research adopts a comparative approach, analyzing a range of movements across different geographical contexts and historical periods to identify common patterns and variations in their impact. We explore the mechanisms through which social movements achieve their objectives, considering factors such as framing strategies, resource mobilization, and network formation.  Furthermore, we analyze the complex interplay between social movements and institutional actors, including states, corporations, and political parties, recognizing both collaborative and adversarial relationships.  The paper concludes by discussing the enduring legacy of social movements, considering their contributions to both incremental and transformative societal change, and highlighting the ongoing relevance of their strategies for addressing contemporary social challenges.  Our findings offer a nuanced understanding of the dynamic relationship between collective action and societal transformation.
