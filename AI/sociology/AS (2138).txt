The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, demanding an interdisciplinary approach encompassing economics, sociology, political science, and psychology.  While traditional economics prioritizes GDP growth as a proxy for well-being, a broader perspective recognizes the limitations of this metric.  Social well-being encompasses a wider array of factors, including health, education, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.  

Effective economic policies should therefore consider distributional effects, acknowledging that economic growth doesn't automatically translate to improved well-being for all segments of society.  Progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and investments in human capital (education and healthcare) are crucial for mitigating inequality and enhancing overall societal well-being.  Furthermore, environmental policies, crucial for long-term sustainability,  interact significantly with economic policies, impacting employment, investment, and resource allocation.  Analyzing these interdependencies necessitates a systemic approach, integrating quantitative economic modeling with qualitative insights from sociological studies on social capital, political science perspectives on policy implementation, and psychological research on subjective well-being and happiness.  Ultimately, achieving genuine social well-being requires a holistic policy framework that prioritizes both economic prosperity and social justice.
