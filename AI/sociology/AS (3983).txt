This paper examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth alone is insufficient to ensure societal prosperity.  We posit that a holistic approach, integrating social indicators alongside traditional economic metrics, is crucial for a comprehensive assessment of policy effectiveness.  The analysis explores diverse policy instruments, including fiscal policies (e.g., taxation, welfare spending), monetary policies (e.g., interest rate adjustments), and regulatory frameworks (e.g., labor market regulations, environmental protection), and their differential impacts on various dimensions of social well-being such as health, education, income inequality, and environmental sustainability. We find that while pro-growth policies can stimulate economic activity, their distributional effects significantly influence social outcomes.  Policies prioritizing equitable resource distribution and social safety nets demonstrate a stronger correlation with improved social well-being, mitigating the negative externalities often associated with unfettered economic expansion.  Further research is warranted to explore the optimal balance between economic growth and social justice in policy design, emphasizing the need for nuanced, context-specific policy interventions that address the complex interplay of economic and social factors.
