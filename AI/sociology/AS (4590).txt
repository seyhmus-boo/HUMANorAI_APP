This presentation examines the evolving role of education in shaping social norms, focusing on recent developments in pedagogical approaches and societal shifts.  Traditional models emphasized knowledge transmission and skill development, but contemporary research highlights education's crucial role in fostering critical thinking, empathy, and prosocial behavior â€“ key components in norm evolution.  We will analyze how inclusive curricula, incorporating diverse perspectives and challenging dominant narratives, contribute to the dismantling of harmful norms and the promotion of social justice.  Recent advancements in digital learning environments also warrant attention, presenting both opportunities (personalized learning, global interconnectedness) and challenges (spread of misinformation, echo chambers).  This presentation will explore these advancements, examining their impact on norm construction and modification across various contexts, including gender equality, environmental sustainability, and intercultural understanding.  Finally, we will discuss the implications for educators and policymakers in leveraging educational strategies for positive societal change, emphasizing the need for ongoing research and adaptive approaches to address the dynamic interplay between education and societal norms.
