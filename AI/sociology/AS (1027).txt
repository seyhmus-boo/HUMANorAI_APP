Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have long been recognized as catalysts for societal transformation.  This paper examines the evolving role of social movements in shaping contemporary societies, focusing on recent developments that challenge traditional understandings of their structure, impact, and longevity.  While classic theories emphasized centralized leadership and clear-cut goals, recent scholarship highlights the increasing fluidity and decentralization of movements, particularly those facilitated by digital technologies.  The rise of networked activism, exemplified by #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, demonstrates the capacity for rapid mobilization across geographical boundaries and the potential for diffuse, leaderless organizations to achieve significant societal impact.  Furthermore, the blurring lines between online and offline mobilization necessitates a re-evaluation of the effectiveness of traditional protest tactics and the measurement of movement success.  This study will analyze these shifts, exploring how digital technologies have reshaped movement strategies, broadened participation, and influenced the nature of societal change achieved, while also considering the limitations and challenges posed by this new landscape of activism.  The analysis will draw upon case studies to illustrate the complexities and diverse outcomes associated with contemporary social movements.
