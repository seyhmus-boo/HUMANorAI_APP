The relationship between education and the propagation of social norms is a complex and enduring one, stretching back to the earliest forms of organized schooling.  Historically, educational systems have served not only to transmit knowledge and skills, but also to instill specific values and beliefs reflecting the prevailing societal structures.  From ancient Greek academies emphasizing civic virtue to the religious seminaries of the medieval period, education has consistently played a role in shaping citizen behavior and reinforcing dominant ideologies.  The rise of mass education in the 19th and 20th centuries further amplified this influence, with national curricula often designed to foster patriotism, conformity, and adherence to established social hierarchies.  However, education's role is not simply one of passive transmission.  Educational institutions can also be sites of contestation and change, where existing norms are challenged and new ones are generated through critical discourse and social interaction. This paper examines the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms, exploring both its conservative function in reinforcing established social structures and its transformative potential in fostering social progress and challenging inequality.  We will analyze how curricula, pedagogy, and the broader educational environment contribute to the socialization process and the internalization of social norms, considering both intended and unintended consequences.
