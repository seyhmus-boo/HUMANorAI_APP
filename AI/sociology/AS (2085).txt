This review examines the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, synthesizing findings from diverse research streams.  Evidence suggests a complex relationship, encompassing both positive and negative consequences.  While social media facilitates social connection and information dissemination, fostering community building and civic engagement in certain contexts, it is also associated with detrimental effects.  Increased exposure correlates with heightened levels of anxiety, depression, and body image dissatisfaction, particularly among young adults.  Furthermore, the curated nature of online self-presentation contributes to social comparison, fostering feelings of inadequacy and impacting self-esteem.  The spread of misinformation and polarization, exacerbated by algorithmic filtering and echo chambers, presents a significant societal challenge.  Future research should focus on nuanced analyses of specific platform effects, mediating variables (e.g., personality traits, usage patterns), and the development of effective interventions to mitigate negative consequences.  A critical appraisal of existing methodologies and a greater emphasis on longitudinal studies are also necessary to fully understand the long-term behavioral impacts of social media.
