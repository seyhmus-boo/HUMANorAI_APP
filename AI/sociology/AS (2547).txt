This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, drawing upon interdisciplinary perspectives from anthropology, sociology, and economics.  While globalization fosters interconnectedness and cultural exchange, its influence on local traditions and identities is complex and often contested. We will examine how economic liberalization, facilitated by global trade and investment, can lead to the commodification of cultural practices, potentially diluting their authenticity and significance.  Simultaneously, we will analyze the role of media and communication technologies in disseminating global cultural trends, leading to both cultural hybridization and the erosion of local languages and customs.  The presentation will further investigate the emergence of resistance movements and revitalization efforts aimed at preserving cultural heritage in the face of globalization's homogenizing pressures. By employing an interdisciplinary lens, we aim to offer a nuanced understanding of the interplay between global forces and local responses, highlighting the enduring resilience of cultural diversity alongside the transformative power of interconnectedness.  Finally, we propose avenues for future research focusing on sustainable development models that integrate global economic participation with the protection and promotion of cultural diversity.
