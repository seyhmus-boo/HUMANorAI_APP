Education plays a crucial role in shaping and perpetuating social norms through both formal and informal curricula.  Formal instruction, encompassing explicit teaching of societal values and expectations, directly influences individuals' internalization of norms.  For instance, civics classes instill respect for laws and democratic processes, while history lessons shape understanding of cultural heritage and its associated norms.  

Furthermore, the informal curriculum—the unspoken rules and social interactions within educational settings—significantly contributes to norm formation.  Observing teacher-student interactions, peer dynamics, and school disciplinary practices, students learn appropriate behaviour and social hierarchies.  This process of social learning reinforces existing norms or, potentially, fosters the development of new ones through exposure to diverse perspectives and challenging established beliefs.

Practical applications include designing curricula that actively promote critical thinking about norms, encouraging discussions about diversity and inclusivity, and implementing conflict-resolution programs to address norm violations constructively.  By consciously shaping both the formal and informal aspects of education, societies can proactively influence the development and evolution of their social norms, potentially mitigating negative norms and fostering positive social change.
