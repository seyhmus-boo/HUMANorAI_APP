Education acts as a powerful sculptor of social norms, subtly yet profoundly shaping societal values and behaviours.  Think of a societal norm as a clay sculpture: initially amorphous, it requires shaping.  Formal education provides the tools – the sculpting knives and chisels – in the form of curricula and pedagogy.  The content imparts knowledge, exposing individuals to diverse perspectives and ethical frameworks, effectively ‘molding’ their understanding of acceptable conduct.  

Furthermore, the educational environment itself, akin to the sculptor’s studio, fosters interaction and socialization. Through collaborative learning and peer influence, students internalize certain behavioural patterns and belief systems, reinforcing specific normative expectations.  Just as a sculptor refines their piece through iterative adjustments, education continuously refines societal norms through evolving curricula and pedagogical approaches, responding to societal shifts and promoting desirable changes. Consequently, education plays a pivotal role not just in transmitting knowledge but in actively constructing and reconstructing the very fabric of social norms.
