The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, defying simple causal inferences. While ostensibly aimed at improving societal welfare, economic policies often produce unintended consequences, making empirical evaluation challenging.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a gold standard in causal inference, are often impractical at the macro-level due to ethical concerns and logistical limitations in manipulating national economic policies.  Observational studies, relying on existing policy variations, suffer from endogeneityâ€”the difficulty in disentangling the effects of a policy from other confounding factors impacting social well-being concurrently.  Furthermore, the measurement of social well-being itself is problematic.  Subjective measures like happiness indices may lack precision and objectivity, while objective indicators such as life expectancy or income inequality might not fully capture the multidimensional nature of well-being, potentially obscuring the true impact of specific policies.  Consequently, rigorous assessment of policy effectiveness requires sophisticated econometric techniques to address endogeneity and carefully constructed composite indices encompassing various facets of well-being.  The inherent limitations in experimental design further highlight the need for theoretical frameworks that comprehensively model these intricate interactions.
