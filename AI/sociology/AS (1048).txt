This presentation examines the evolving relationship between economic policies and social well-being, focusing on recent developments that challenge traditional neo-liberal approaches.  While economic growth has long been considered a primary indicator of societal progress, recent research emphasizes the limitations of this singular metric and highlights the growing inequality accompanying periods of robust GDP growth.  We analyze the impact of diverse policy instruments – including minimum wage legislation, social safety nets, and investment in human capital – on key dimensions of well-being such as health, education, and subjective happiness.  Recent empirical studies demonstrating the positive correlation between robust social safety nets and improved population health outcomes will be discussed.  Furthermore, the presentation addresses the implications of automation and technological advancements on employment and income distribution, and how proactive policy interventions, such as universal basic income schemes, are being debated as potential solutions to mitigate negative social consequences.  Finally, we consider the growing recognition of environmental sustainability as an integral component of long-term social well-being, arguing for a shift towards policies that prioritize inclusive growth and ecological balance.  The presentation concludes by suggesting avenues for future research and policy design that more effectively integrate economic goals with the broader pursuit of social well-being.
