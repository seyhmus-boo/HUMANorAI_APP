This presentation examines the multifaceted role of education in shaping and transforming social norms.  While often implicitly assumed, the mechanisms through which education influences societal values remain under-explored.  We argue that education acts not solely as a conduit of information, but as a powerful socialising agent, impacting norms through several key pathways.  Firstly, formal curricula directly address societal issues, promoting critical thinking and challenging existing norms related to gender, race, and equality. Secondly, the hidden curriculum, encompassing school culture and social interactions, subtly reinforces or subverts prevailing norms.  Thirdly, educational attainment correlates with increased social mobility and exposure to diverse perspectives, potentially fostering more inclusive and tolerant attitudes.  This presentation will explore empirical evidence supporting these pathways, drawing upon existing literature in sociology of education and social psychology.  We will consider the limitations of education's influence, acknowledging the persistence of entrenched norms and the potential for educational systems to inadvertently perpetuate inequalities.  Finally, we will discuss implications for educational policy and practice in fostering positive social change through intentional norm transformation.
