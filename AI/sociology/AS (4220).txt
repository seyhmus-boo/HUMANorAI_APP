Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on class inequality and its societal ramifications, particularly recent developments.  While class stratification has always existed, contemporary trends reveal a deepening chasm between the wealthy elite and the rest of the population.  This widening gap, fueled by globalization, technological advancements, and neoliberal economic policies, has significant consequences.

Increased income inequality correlates with reduced social mobility, hindering individual advancement and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  Furthermore, rising wealth disparity contributes to political polarization, as disparate socioeconomic groups hold diverging interests and priorities.  This manifests in decreased social cohesion and trust, impacting civic engagement and potentially undermining democratic institutions. Recent research also highlights the detrimental effects on public health, with higher rates of mortality and morbidity observed in lower socioeconomic groups, linked to stress, inadequate healthcare access, and environmental factors.  Addressing this complex issue necessitates a multi-pronged approach, encompassing progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and investments in education and healthcare to foster a more equitable and just society.
