Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, exerts profound and multifaceted effects on social structures and individual well-being. While the existence of inequality is widely acknowledged, isolating and quantifying its precise consequences remains a significant challenge for social scientists. This paper addresses the methodological hurdles inherent in researching the causal relationship between class inequality and its societal impacts.  Existing observational studies, while revealing correlations, often struggle to disentangle the complex interplay of confounding factors –  geographic location, historical context, and pre-existing social disparities – making causal inference problematic.  Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard in establishing causality, are ethically and practically infeasible for manipulating class structures on a large scale. This inherent limitation necessitates the exploration of quasi-experimental designs, such as regression discontinuity or instrumental variable approaches, to mitigate confounding biases and strengthen causal claims. We will examine the strengths and limitations of various experimental and quasi-experimental methodologies, highlighting their application in studying specific outcomes like health disparities, educational attainment, and political polarization, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the causal pathways linking class inequality to broader societal outcomes.
