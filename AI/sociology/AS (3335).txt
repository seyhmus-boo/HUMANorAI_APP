This presentation explores the multifaceted and often contradictory effects of globalization on local cultures, highlighting the inherent methodological challenges in empirically assessing such complex interactions.  While globalization's homogenizing influence is widely acknowledged, its impact varies significantly across contexts, demanding nuanced research designs beyond simple comparative analyses.  We argue that the experimental approach, though rarely employed in this field, offers unique possibilities for isolating specific globalization factors and their cultural consequences.  However, ethical considerations surrounding manipulation of cultural practices pose significant hurdles. This presentation will discuss the challenges of designing robust, ethically sound experiments, including issues of defining and measuring cultural change, establishing appropriate control groups, and addressing potential confounding variables like pre-existing socio-economic disparities. We will analyze existing literature, proposing potential experimental paradigms – such as controlled exposure to global media or simulated international exchange programs – while acknowledging their limitations and ethical implications.  Finally, we will outline a roadmap for future research, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative methodologies to address the profound and ongoing impact of globalization on cultural diversity.
