Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and perpetuating social norms, acting as both a transmitter and transformer of cultural values.  This paper examines the multifaceted nature of this influence, exploring how formal educational settings transmit dominant societal norms through curriculum content, pedagogical approaches, and implicit biases embedded within institutional structures.  Furthermore, education can actively challenge and reshape norms.  Critical pedagogy, for instance, fosters critical consciousness, empowering individuals to question existing power dynamics and advocate for social change.  However, the effectiveness of education in this regard is contingent upon factors such as curriculum inclusivity, teacher training, and the broader socio-political context.  Ultimately,  the relationship between education and social norms is complex and dynamic, with the educational system functioning simultaneously as a conservative force maintaining the status quo and a progressive agent driving social transformation.  Future research should explore strategies for maximizing education's transformative potential in fostering equitable and just social norms.
