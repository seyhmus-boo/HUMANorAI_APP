This presentation examines the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on society.  While the existence of social stratification is a historical constant, the scale and consequences of contemporary inequality demand urgent attention. We will explore how disparities in wealth, income, and access to resources – including education, healthcare, and justice – perpetuate a cycle of disadvantage across generations.  This analysis will draw upon sociological and economic theories to demonstrate how inequality undermines social cohesion, fueling political polarization, increasing crime rates, and exacerbating health disparities.  Furthermore, we will discuss the detrimental effects on social mobility, limiting opportunities for upward advancement and reinforcing existing power structures.

The practical applications of this research are significant. Understanding the mechanisms driving inequality informs the development of effective policy interventions. We will consider the potential efficacy of progressive taxation, increased investment in public services, and targeted programs aimed at improving educational attainment and addressing systemic biases in employment and housing.  Finally, the presentation will briefly touch upon the role of ethical consumption and corporate social responsibility in mitigating the societal costs of class inequality, encouraging a broader discussion on the responsibilities of individuals and institutions in fostering a more equitable society.
