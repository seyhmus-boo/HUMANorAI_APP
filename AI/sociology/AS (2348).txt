This presentation explores the crucial role of education in shaping and reshaping social norms.  While often viewed as a vehicle for individual advancement, education profoundly impacts societal values and behaviors through both formal and informal curricula.  We argue that education's influence transcends the transmission of knowledge, extending to the cultivation of critical thinking, empathy, and social responsibility.  By incorporating inclusive pedagogies and diverse perspectives, educational institutions can actively challenge harmful norms and foster environments conducive to positive social change.  Practical applications will be examined, including the implementation of social-emotional learning programs to promote prosocial behaviors, the integration of culturally responsive teaching methods to address societal biases, and the use of participatory learning strategies to empower students as agents of social transformation.  The presentation will showcase case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of these strategies in addressing issues such as gender inequality, environmental sustainability, and community engagement.  Finally, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities inherent in leveraging education's potential to create more equitable and just societies.
