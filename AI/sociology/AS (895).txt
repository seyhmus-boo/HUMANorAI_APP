Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, profoundly impacts various aspects of social life, as evidenced by a considerable body of research. This review synthesizes key findings on the multifaceted effects of this inequality.  Studies consistently demonstrate a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and health outcomes, with lower-class individuals experiencing higher rates of morbidity and mortality due to factors such as limited access to healthcare and increased exposure to environmental hazards.  Educational attainment is also significantly influenced, with disadvantaged backgrounds limiting opportunities for advancement and perpetuating intergenerational inequality.  Furthermore, class disparities contribute to significant differences in political participation and influence, potentially undermining democratic processes.  Economic inequality exacerbates social stratification, fostering resentment, social unrest, and impacting social cohesion.  While some argue for the beneficial effects of inequality as an incentive for innovation, the overwhelming evidence highlights the detrimental social, economic, and health consequences of significant class gaps, emphasizing the urgent need for policy interventions aimed at reducing inequality and promoting social justice.  Further research should focus on evaluating the effectiveness of specific policy interventions and exploring the long-term impacts of class inequality across diverse societal contexts.
