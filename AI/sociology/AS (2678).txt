This presentation explores the often-overlooked parallels between quantum mechanics and the complex interplay of economic policies and social well-being.  Traditional macroeconomic models often assume a deterministic, classical framework, neglecting the inherent uncertainties and probabilistic nature of social systems.  Drawing on the concepts of superposition and entanglement from quantum theory, we propose a new interpretative lens for analyzing the impact of economic interventions.  Just as a quantum particle exists in multiple states simultaneously until measurement, societal outcomes are influenced by a superposition of potential policy effects.  Furthermore, the interconnectedness of various social indicators (e.g., health, education, income inequality) resembles quantum entanglement, where changes in one variable instantaneously affect others.  This presentation will discuss how adopting a quantum-inspired framework can improve our understanding of policy efficacy.  Specifically, we will examine how probabilistic modeling, informed by quantum principles, can yield more accurate predictions of social outcomes and better inform policy design aimed at maximizing collective well-being, particularly concerning issues such as poverty reduction and wealth redistribution. We argue that acknowledging the inherent uncertainties and interconnectedness within socio-economic systems, through this novel perspective, is essential for effective policymaking.
