This presentation examines the complex relationship between social movements and societal change, focusing on the inherent experimental challenges in researching their impact.  While social movements demonstrably contribute to shifts in social norms, policies, and power structures, quantifying and isolating their causal effect remains a significant methodological hurdle.  The presentation explores several key experimental challenges, including the difficulties of establishing counterfactuals in the absence of controlled interventions, the inherent heterogeneity of movements and their goals, and the temporal lag between mobilization and observable societal change.  We will critically assess the limitations of quantitative approaches, such as regression discontinuity design, when applied to the dynamic and often unpredictable nature of social movements.  Qualitative methodologies, including ethnographic studies and process tracing, offer valuable complementary insights, but their inherent subjectivity requires careful consideration.  Finally, we will propose a mixed-methods approach that leverages the strengths of both quantitative and qualitative research to offer a more nuanced and robust understanding of the causal pathways through which social movements effect societal change, acknowledging the inherent limitations of any single research design.
