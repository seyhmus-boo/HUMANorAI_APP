The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and often challenging to empirically assess. While intuitively, policies aiming to boost GDP or reduce inequality should improve well-being, the reality is nuanced.  Experimental approaches, while offering valuable insights, face significant hurdles.  Firstly, the ethical considerations of manipulating socio-economic factors on a large scale are considerable.  Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard, are often impractical due to cost, logistical complexity, and the inherent difficulties in isolating the impact of a single policy from numerous confounding variables.

Furthermore, defining and measuring "social well-being" itself presents a methodological challenge.  Subjective measures like happiness or life satisfaction, while increasingly used, are susceptible to contextual effects and cultural biases.  Objective indicators such as health outcomes or crime rates, while easier to quantify, may not fully capture the multifaceted nature of well-being.  The long-term effects of policies are also difficult to ascertain, necessitating longitudinal studies that face attrition and shifting societal contexts.  Ultimately, disentangling the causal links between economic policies and social well-being requires a multi-faceted approach, acknowledging the inherent limitations of experimental designs and integrating qualitative data to enrich quantitative findings.
