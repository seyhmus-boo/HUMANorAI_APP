Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, play a crucial role in instigating and shaping societal change. This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of this relationship, examining how movements challenge existing power structures and norms.  Resource mobilization theory highlights the importance of organizational capacity and access to resources in a movement's success, while framing theory emphasizes the construction of shared understandings and narratives that legitimize collective action.  Political opportunity structures, encompassing the openness of the political system to dissent and the presence of political allies, significantly influence the likelihood of movement emergence and impact.  Furthermore, the paper considers the processes of framing, mobilization, and negotiation through which movements effect change, acknowledging both incremental adjustments and transformative shifts in societal norms, policies, and institutions. Ultimately, the impact of social movements on societal change depends on a complex interplay of internal movement dynamics and the broader socio-political context.
