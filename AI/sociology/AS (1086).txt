The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has long been a subject of intense debate across diverse academic disciplines.  While traditionally viewed through the lens of economics, a comprehensive understanding necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, incorporating insights from sociology, political science, psychology, and public health. This paper examines the multifaceted connections between macroeconomic strategies and societal outcomes, moving beyond simplistic correlations to explore nuanced causal pathways.  We argue that focusing solely on economic growth indicators, such as GDP, provides an incomplete picture of societal progress.  Instead, we advocate for a more holistic framework that incorporates a broader range of social well-being metrics, including health outcomes, education levels, environmental sustainability, and social equity.  This research will investigate how specific economic policies, such as taxation, social welfare programs, and labour market regulations, differentially impact various demographic groups and contribute to either widening or narrowing existing social inequalities. By drawing upon diverse theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence, we aim to illuminate the complex interplay between economic choices and their societal consequences, highlighting the need for policy design that prioritizes both economic efficiency and social justice.
