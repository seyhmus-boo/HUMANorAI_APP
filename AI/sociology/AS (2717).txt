This presentation explores the impact of social media on human behavior through a novel lens: quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate, the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically superposition and entanglement, offer a compelling framework for understanding the complex interplay between individual agency and collective online influence.  We posit that the individual's "mental state," analogous to a quantum superposition of beliefs and opinions, is significantly influenced by the entangled network of social media interactions.  Exposure to diverse perspectives, represented as a superposition of information states, can lead to rapid shifts in individual opinion, mirroring quantum transitions.  Furthermore, the inherently interconnected nature of social media platforms resembles quantum entanglement, where individual actions and beliefs become correlated and influence the overall system dynamics, leading to the emergence of collective behaviors such as social movements or information cascades.  We will discuss how the probabilistic nature of quantum measurements finds parallels in the unpredictable nature of viral trends and the amplification of misinformation. By applying quantum theoretical concepts, we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of how social media shapes individual and collective human behavior beyond traditional sociological models.  This interdisciplinary approach opens avenues for future research in predicting and potentially mitigating the unintended consequences of this pervasive technology.
