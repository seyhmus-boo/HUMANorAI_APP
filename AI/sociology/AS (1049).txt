This presentation examines the evolving role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on recent developments and challenges.  While traditional models emphasized collective action and mobilization around shared grievances, contemporary movements demonstrate a greater fluidity and diversity in tactics, organization, and goals.  We will explore the increasing influence of digital technologies in facilitating transnational networks and rapid mobilization, exemplified by #MeToo and Black Lives Matter. These movements highlight the capacity of online spaces to amplify marginalized voices and challenge established power structures, yet also present challenges related to information manipulation and algorithmic bias.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the shift from centralized hierarchical structures to more decentralized, networked forms of organization, impacting both internal dynamics and external engagement with institutions.  Finally, we will discuss the complex interplay between social movements and state responses, considering both repressive tactics and instances of co-optation or negotiation.  By examining these recent developments, we aim to refine our understanding of social movement dynamics and their efficacy in achieving lasting societal transformation.
