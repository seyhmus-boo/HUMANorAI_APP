Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to fully comprehend its multifaceted nature and consequences.  This research paper investigates the pervasive effects of class inequality on society, drawing upon insights from sociology, economics, political science, and psychology to provide a comprehensive analysis.  While economic disparities are a central component, we argue that a solely economic framework is insufficient to capture the complex interplay of factors contributing to and resulting from class stratification.  We examine how unequal access to resources, including education, healthcare, and political influence, reinforces existing inequalities and perpetuates cycles of disadvantage across generations.  The paper explores the social psychological impact of class inequality on individual well-being, mental health, and social mobility, alongside its broader effects on social cohesion, political stability, and economic growth. By integrating diverse theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence, this study aims to illuminate the intricate web of relationships between class inequality and its societal ramifications, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced understanding of this critical issue and informing potential policy interventions.
