The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, drawing insights from economics, sociology, political science, and public health.  While neoclassical economics often prioritizes GDP growth as a proxy for well-being, a more holistic understanding acknowledges the limitations of this singular metric.  Sociological perspectives illuminate how economic inequalities, shaped by policy choices like taxation and social welfare programs, directly impact social cohesion, health outcomes, and crime rates.  Political science analyses reveal the influence of lobbying and power dynamics on policy formulation, often favouring specific interests over broader societal welfare.  Furthermore, public health research demonstrates a strong correlation between economic insecurity and indicators like life expectancy and mental health.  Critically, examining the distributional effects of policies is paramount; policies promoting growth without equitable distribution can exacerbate social disparities.  A robust interdisciplinary framework is therefore crucial for crafting effective economic policies that genuinely enhance social well-being, moving beyond simplistic economic indicators towards a more nuanced and comprehensive evaluation of societal progress.
