Economic policies exert a profound influence on social well-being, a multifaceted construct encompassing health, education, and social equity.  This paper explores the complex interplay between these domains.  Expansionary fiscal policies, while potentially stimulating economic growth, may exacerbate inequality if benefits are not equitably distributed, impacting social cohesion and individual well-being.  Conversely, austerity measures, aimed at fiscal consolidation, can lead to reduced public spending on social programs, negatively affecting health outcomes and educational attainment, thereby undermining long-term social well-being.  The effectiveness of specific policies is contingent upon contextual factors, such as institutional capacity and the pre-existing level of social inequality.  Optimal policy design necessitates a holistic approach, integrating macroeconomic objectives with explicit consideration of social welfare indicators.  Further research should focus on developing robust econometric models that comprehensively capture the complex, dynamic relationships between specific policy instruments and diverse dimensions of social well-being, enabling evidence-based policymaking for improved societal outcomes.
