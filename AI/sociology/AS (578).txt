The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, historically exhibiting a dynamic interplay between growth and equity.  Early laissez-faire capitalism, dominant from the 18th century, prioritized economic growth often at the expense of social well-being, resulting in stark inequalities and widespread poverty.  The ensuing social unrest and the Great Depression spurred the development of Keynesian economics, which advocated for government intervention to manage the business cycle and mitigate unemployment, thereby bolstering social security.  Post-war welfare states in Europe exemplified this approach, prioritizing social safety nets through robust social programs funded by progressive taxation.

However, critiques emerged concerning the efficiency and sustainability of large welfare states.  The neoliberal shift from the 1980s emphasized deregulation, privatization, and free markets, arguing that economic growth would ultimately "trickle down" to improve overall social well-being.  Empirical evidence on the effectiveness of this approach remains contested, with some studies highlighting increased inequality and diminished social mobility despite periods of economic expansion.  Contemporary research increasingly emphasizes the need for a nuanced approach, acknowledging the vital role of both economic growth and equitable distribution in achieving sustainable social well-being, with a focus on human capital development, environmental sustainability, and inclusive growth strategies.
