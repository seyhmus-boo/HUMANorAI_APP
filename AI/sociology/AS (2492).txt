Social norms, the unwritten rules governing social behavior, are fundamental to societal cohesion and stability.  While often implicitly learned, their formation and perpetuation are significantly influenced by educational processes. This paper investigates the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms, exploring how formal and informal learning environments contribute to their transmission, modification, and eventual internalization.  We argue that education acts not merely as a conveyor of existing norms, but also as a crucial agent for social change, facilitating the development of new norms and the challenging of outdated or harmful ones.  Our analysis considers various educational levels, from primary schooling to higher education, examining the impact of curricula, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment on normative behavior.  Understanding this dynamic is crucial for designing effective interventions aimed at promoting positive social change. Practical applications of this research include developing curricula that explicitly address social issues, fostering critical thinking skills necessary for norm evaluation, and designing educational strategies to counteract harmful norms such as gender inequality, prejudice, and violence.  Ultimately, this research contributes to a deeper comprehension of the powerful interplay between education and the evolving landscape of social norms.
