The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, demanding an interdisciplinary approach.  Purely economic analyses, focusing solely on GDP growth or inflation, fail to capture the nuanced impact of policy on social outcomes.  Sociology provides crucial insight into how economic inequality, fostered by certain policies, affects social cohesion and health disparities.  For example, regressive taxation can exacerbate poverty, leading to increased crime rates and reduced life expectancy, as demonstrated by numerous sociological studies.  Similarly, public health research reveals the correlation between economic insecurity and mental health issues, highlighting the limitations of purely economic metrics.  Psychology contributes by exploring the impact of economic instability on individual stress and well-being, and how policies aimed at providing social safety nets can mitigate these negative effects.  Therefore, a holistic understanding necessitates integrating perspectives from economics, sociology, public health, and psychology to effectively design and evaluate policies that genuinely enhance social well-being, rather than solely focusing on economic growth.
