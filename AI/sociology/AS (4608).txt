This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, moving beyond simplistic narratives of positive or negative influence.  We analyze the pervasive nature of social media's influence on cognition, emotion, and social interaction, drawing upon recent empirical research in psychology and sociology.  Specifically, we explore the effects of social comparison on self-esteem, the role of algorithmic curation in shaping information consumption and political polarization, and the impact of online social interaction on offline relationships.  The presentation will critically assess both the affordances and limitations of current methodologies in studying these complex relationships, highlighting the challenges of establishing causality and disentangling correlational effects.  Finally, we discuss practical applications of this research. This includes strategies for mitigating the negative impacts of social media use, such as fostering media literacy and developing interventions to address cyberbullying and online harassment.  Furthermore, we will explore the potential of social media for positive behavioral change, including its application in public health campaigns and promoting prosocial behavior.
