This review examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change.  While diverse in their goals and tactics, social movements consistently demonstrate the capacity to challenge existing power structures and influence policy agendas.  Analysis of extant literature reveals a complex interplay between movement mobilization, framing strategies, and the broader socio-political context.  Successful movements effectively leverage resources, build coalitions, and utilize various forms of collective action, from protests and civil disobedience to digital activism. However, the impact of social movements is not guaranteed, and factors such as state repression, counter-movements, and internal divisions significantly influence outcomes. The review highlights the ongoing debate concerning the extent to which movements achieve their stated goals, versus generating more nuanced, unintended consequences.  Ultimately, social movements are crucial actors in processes of social transformation, representing vital spaces for marginalized voices and catalysts for progressive change, although their efficacy remains contingent on a multitude of interacting factors. Future research should further explore the long-term impacts of movements, paying particular attention to the intersection of online and offline activism.
