The advent and proliferation of social media platforms have irrevocably altered the landscape of human interaction and communication, prompting extensive investigation into their impact on behaviour.  While the earliest forms of online social interaction can be traced back to bulletin board systems and early chat rooms of the 1980s and 90s, the rise of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram in the 21st century represents a paradigm shift in scale and influence. This rapid expansion has created a uniquely pervasive environment, impacting not only interpersonal relationships but also broader societal trends, political discourse, and even mental health. This paper examines the multifaceted influence of social media on human behavior, exploring both its positive and negative ramifications. We will analyze its effects on self-esteem and identity formation, considering the impact of curated online personas and the pressures of social comparison.  Further, we will investigate the role of social media in shaping political opinions and facilitating both social movements and the spread of misinformation. Finally, the paper will critically assess the current research landscape and propose avenues for future investigation into this rapidly evolving field.
