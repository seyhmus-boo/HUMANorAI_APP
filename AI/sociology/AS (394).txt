This review examines the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted societal effects.  Existing literature consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between socioeconomic disparities and a range of negative outcomes, impacting both individual well-being and societal stability.  Studies highlight the detrimental effects on health, education, and life expectancy, with lower-class individuals experiencing significantly poorer outcomes.  Furthermore, class inequality fuels social unrest, contributing to increased crime rates, political polarization, and diminished social cohesion.  The mechanisms through which inequality operates are complex and interconnected, encompassing factors such as limited access to resources, discriminatory practices, and inherited advantage.  While some research emphasizes the economic consequences, others underscore the psychological and social implications, including increased stress, reduced social mobility, and the perpetuation of intergenerational disadvantage.  Future research should focus on developing effective interventions targeting both the root causes and the cascading effects of class inequality, with a particular emphasis on policy solutions promoting equitable access to opportunities and resources.  Addressing class inequality is crucial for fostering a more just and prosperous society.
