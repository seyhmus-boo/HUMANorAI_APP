This presentation examines the role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on the inherent experimental challenges in studying their efficacy. While widely acknowledged as powerful agents of transformation, rigorous causal inference regarding their impact remains elusive.  The inherent complexity of social movements – their decentralized nature, diverse goals, and dynamic interactions with existing power structures – presents significant methodological hurdles.  Traditional quantitative approaches struggle to isolate the effects of a specific movement from broader societal trends or concurrent events.  Qualitative methods, while offering rich contextual understanding, often lack generalizability.

This presentation will discuss several key experimental challenges:  the difficulty in establishing robust counterfactuals, the ethical considerations of manipulating social movement activities, and the challenges of measuring long-term, diffuse impacts. We will explore innovative methodologies such as process tracing, comparative case studies employing statistical matching techniques, and the potential of natural experiments, focusing on instances where exogenous shocks impact movement trajectories. Ultimately, we argue that a mixed-methods approach, carefully considering the limitations of each technique, is crucial for advancing our understanding of the causal mechanisms linking social movements to societal change.  The presentation will conclude with suggestions for future research directions designed to overcome these experimental challenges.
