Globalization's impact on local cultures can be conceptually modeled using quantum mechanical principles of superposition and entanglement.  Pre-globalization, a culture exists in a relatively pure state, analogous to a localized wave function.  Globalization introduces interactions, akin to external potentials, causing superposition. The culture is no longer solely defined by its original characteristics but exists in a probabilistic superposition of its traditional elements and externally-introduced influences.  This superposition isn't simply additive; the interaction terms introduce complex interference patterns, leading to unpredictable outcomes.  Some traditional aspects may be amplified, others attenuated, depending on the strength and nature of the globalizing forces.

Further, different cultures become entangled.  The adoption of globalized trends in one culture influences the state of others, creating correlated cultural evolutions.  This entanglement, however, is not perfect; individual cultural identities retain a degree of independence, represented by the non-zero uncertainty in the measurement of individual cultural characteristics.  Ultimately, globalization's effect isn't a simple process of assimilation or replacement, but a complex, probabilistic entanglement generating a new, superpositioned stateâ€”a hybridized culture shaped by the interplay of internal and external influences.  The final outcome is not deterministic but subject to the stochastic nature of cultural interactions.
