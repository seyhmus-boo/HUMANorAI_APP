This paper examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth alone is insufficient for achieving societal prosperity.  We posit that effective economic policies must consider a broader range of social outcomes, including health, education, and environmental sustainability, acknowledging their interconnectedness with economic indicators.  A review of existing literature reveals a complex interplay: while robust economic growth can undoubtedly contribute to improved living standards,  unequal distribution of wealth and income, often exacerbated by neoliberal policies prioritizing deregulation and austerity, can significantly undermine social well-being.  Furthermore, the pursuit of short-term economic gains frequently neglects long-term social costs, such as environmental degradation and increased social inequality.  Conversely, social investments in areas such as healthcare and education, while potentially involving short-term economic costs,  generate significant long-term benefits in terms of a healthier, more productive, and ultimately more prosperous society. We conclude that holistic policymaking, explicitly incorporating social metrics and equity considerations alongside purely economic ones, is crucial for achieving sustainable and inclusive social well-being.  Future research should focus on developing robust methodologies for measuring and quantifying this complex interplay.
