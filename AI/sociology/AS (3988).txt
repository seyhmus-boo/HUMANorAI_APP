The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a complex and multifaceted issue demanding an interdisciplinary approach.  While traditional economics focuses on aggregate measures like GDP, a comprehensive understanding necessitates integrating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science.  Studies reveal a strong correlation between economic inequality and decreased social cohesion, a finding supported by sociological research on the social consequences of poverty and wealth disparity.  Psychological studies further illuminate the impact of economic insecurity on mental health and well-being, highlighting the non-monetary dimensions of economic policy's effects.

Political science contributes by analyzing the distributional effects of policies and the political processes influencing their design and implementation.  For example, policies prioritizing neoliberal deregulation may boost GDP but simultaneously exacerbate inequality, leading to social unrest as documented by political scientists.  Effectively addressing social well-being requires acknowledging this interplay.  Future research should focus on developing more nuanced metrics beyond GDP, incorporating subjective well-being measures and considering the diverse pathways through which economic policies affect different social groups.  Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for designing and evaluating economic policies that truly promote both economic growth and social well-being.
