Education's influence on societal norms is a subject of enduring scholarly interest, yet its multifaceted mechanisms and dynamic impact remain areas of ongoing investigation.  This paper explores the evolving role of education in shaping social norms, acknowledging recent developments that challenge traditional understandings. While earlier research predominantly focused on the transmission of pre-existing cultural values through formalized curricula, contemporary scholarship increasingly emphasizes the pedagogical environment's capacity for norm creation and transformation.  Recent studies utilizing longitudinal data and sophisticated statistical methods have revealed nuanced relationships between educational attainment, exposure to diverse perspectives, and subsequent shifts in individual attitudes and behaviors concerning issues such as gender equality, environmental sustainability, and civic participation.  Furthermore, the proliferation of digital learning environments and globalized educational exchanges necessitate re-evaluation of traditional models, acknowledging the potential for both homogenization and diversification of social norms. This paper will analyze these recent developments, examining the interplay between formal and informal educational settings, the impact of curriculum design, and the role of peer interactions in shaping evolving social norms.
