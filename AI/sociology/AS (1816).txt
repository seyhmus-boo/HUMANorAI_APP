This presentation explores the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, emphasizing the crucial need for interdisciplinary collaboration to achieve effective and equitable outcomes.  While traditional economics often prioritizes growth metrics, a holistic understanding requires integrating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science.  We argue that focusing solely on GDP growth overlooks crucial aspects of social well-being, such as health, education, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.  Using a mixed-methods approach, we examine how specific economic policies, including taxation, social welfare programs, and environmental regulations, differentially impact diverse social groups.  The presentation will analyze case studies demonstrating the social consequences of austerity measures versus investment in human capital and social infrastructure.  By drawing on interdisciplinary frameworks, such as the capability approach and social determinants of health, we identify policy recommendations that prioritize not just economic growth but also a more just and equitable distribution of resources, leading to improved societal well-being across different segments of the population.  The discussion will highlight the potential for creating more robust and socially beneficial policy design through interdisciplinary dialogue and collaboration.
