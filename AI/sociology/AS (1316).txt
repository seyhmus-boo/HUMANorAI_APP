Education's role in shaping social norms has long been a subject of sociological inquiry, but recent developments in cognitive science and behavioral economics offer nuanced perspectives on this complex relationship.  While traditional views emphasized education's function in transmitting pre-existing societal values, contemporary research increasingly highlights its capacity to actively *construct* and even *transform* norms.  This paper explores this dynamic interplay, examining how formal and informal educational settings influence the internalization and dissemination of social norms.

Recent studies leveraging longitudinal data and experimental methodologies have illuminated the mechanisms through which education impacts normative behavior.  For instance, research on cognitive development underscores the importance of education in fostering critical thinking skills, enabling individuals to evaluate and potentially challenge existing norms.  Furthermore, advancements in understanding social learning and conformity demonstrate the role of educational institutions in modeling desired behaviors and providing social contexts for norm internalization.

This paper will analyze these recent findings, considering the influence of various educational factors, such as curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the broader socio-cultural environment of the educational institution, on shaping social norms across different contexts.  We will further discuss the implications of these findings for policy and practice, particularly regarding the design of educational interventions aimed at promoting positive social change.
