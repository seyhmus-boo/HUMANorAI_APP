This presentation explores the unconventional application of quantum mechanical principles to understand the complex relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  We posit that societal systems, while macroscopic, exhibit emergent properties analogous to quantum phenomena, characterized by superposition and entanglement.  Economic policies, acting as external potentials, can induce transitions between different "social states," each representing a unique configuration of well-being indicators (e.g., health, education, inequality).  We argue that the efficacy of a policy isn't solely determined by its classical, deterministic effects, but also by its ability to steer the system's evolution through the superposition of potential outcomes.  Furthermore, the entanglement between various well-being indicators suggests that interventions targeting one aspect (e.g., income redistribution) might unexpectedly affect seemingly unrelated factors (e.g., public health). This perspective challenges traditional neoclassical assumptions of rationality and predictability, proposing a more nuanced understanding of policy impact. We will illustrate this conceptual framework using simplified models, exploring how quantum-inspired computational methods could be employed to analyze and predict the probabilistic evolution of social well-being under different policy scenarios. The ultimate goal is to identify policy strategies that optimize not just average outcomes but also minimize the risk of undesirable societal collapses analogous to quantum decoherence.
