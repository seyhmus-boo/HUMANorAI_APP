This presentation explores the impact of globalization on local cultures through the lens of quantum mechanics, proposing a conceptual framework based on superposition and entanglement.  Globalization, we argue, acts as a complex, multi-faceted “measurement” upon the superposition of cultural states that exist within a given locality.  Prior to significant globalization, a culture exists in a superposition of potential expressions, a probabilistic wave function encompassing various traditions, practices, and beliefs.  Globalization, through the influx of information and interactions, collapses this wave function, favoring certain cultural aspects while suppressing others.  This "measurement" is not deterministic;  the resulting cultural state is probabilistic and influenced by factors like pre-existing cultural robustness and the strength of globalizing forces.  Furthermore, entanglement arises through cultural exchange – local cultural elements become intertwined with global trends, resulting in hybrid forms exhibiting properties not present in the isolated systems.  However, this entanglement isn't necessarily uniform; some cultural elements may remain relatively decoherent, exhibiting strong local resilience.  The presentation will analyze case studies illustrating these phenomena, highlighting the non-linear and often unpredictable nature of cultural change within the globalized landscape and suggesting avenues for future research exploring cultural resilience through the framework of quantum-inspired models.
