This research paper explores the pervasive societal impact of class inequality through a novel lens: the conceptual framework of quantum mechanics. While seemingly disparate, the principles of superposition, entanglement, and quantum tunneling offer intriguing parallels to the complex, interconnected, and often unpredictable dynamics of social stratification.  Traditional sociological analyses predominantly employ classical mechanics, focusing on individual and group actions within established structures.  However,  the emergent nature of societal inequality, with its unpredictable consequences arising from myriad individual interactions, suggests the limitations of this purely deterministic approach. We posit that a quantum mechanical perspective, emphasizing probabilistic outcomes and the influence of seemingly minor events on macroscopic societal structures, can provide valuable insights. This paper will investigate how concepts such as superposition – representing the simultaneous existence of multiple class identities within an individual – and entanglement – reflecting the interconnectedness of class experiences across different societal domains – can enrich our understanding of inequality's multifaceted effects.  Specifically, we will analyze how the "tunneling" effect, representing the potential for social mobility despite seemingly insurmountable barriers, can be conceptualized and measured within this framework.  The ultimate aim is to demonstrate the potential of quantum-inspired models in enriching our understanding of class inequality and its societal consequences.
