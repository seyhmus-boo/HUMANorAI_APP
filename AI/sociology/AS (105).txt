This review examines the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, synthesizing existing research across sociology, anthropology, and psychology.  While diversity is often posited as a societal strength, its impact on social integration is complex and contingent upon various contextual factors.  Studies consistently demonstrate that greater diversity can be associated with increased social capital in some contexts, fostered by intercultural contact and the development of bridging social ties. However, the presence of significant cultural cleavages, coupled with insufficient institutional support for intercultural dialogue and equity, can lead to social fragmentation and exclusion.  This review highlights the critical role of inclusive policies, effective communication strategies, and proactive efforts to address prejudice and discrimination in fostering successful social integration within diverse societies.  Future research should focus on longitudinal studies examining the dynamic interplay between specific diversity dimensions (e.g., ethnic, religious, linguistic) and their impact on different aspects of social cohesion, such as trust, civic engagement, and intergroup relations.  Ultimately, the successful integration of diverse populations hinges on creating equitable environments that value both individual differences and shared social goals.
