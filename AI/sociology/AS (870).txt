Social movements, collective actions aimed at achieving social or political change, have historically been pivotal in reshaping societies.  This paper examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal transformation, considering recent theoretical and empirical developments.  While classical theories emphasized resource mobilization and political opportunity structures, contemporary scholarship increasingly highlights the significance of framing processes, identity politics, and the influence of digital technologies.  Recent events, including the Arab Spring uprisings, the Black Lives Matter movement, and the global climate justice activism, underscore the continued potency of social movements in challenging established power structures and advocating for alternative visions of society.  These movements demonstrate the evolving strategies employed, ranging from online mobilization and viral campaigns to localized, grassroots organizing, highlighting the fluidity and adaptability of collective action in the 21st century.  This study will analyze the interplay between these factors, exploring how movements leverage digital platforms, cultivate collective identities, and frame their narratives to achieve their objectives, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of their impact on societal change.
