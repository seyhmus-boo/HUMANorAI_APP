The advent and proliferation of social media platforms have profoundly reshaped the human experience, presenting a fertile ground for investigating their impact on individual and collective behavior.  While interpersonal communication has always been a cornerstone of human society, the digital revolution, beginning with the emergence of early online forums and bulletin board systems in the late 20th century, dramatically altered its scale and dynamics. The subsequent rise of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, characterized by their ease of use and widespread accessibility, has accelerated this transformation, creating unprecedented opportunities for social interaction, information dissemination, and community building. However, this unprecedented connectivity has also raised significant concerns about its influence on mental health, political polarization, the spread of misinformation, and the formation of social identities. This research paper explores the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, examining both the positive and negative consequences of its pervasive influence.  We will analyze existing literature across various disciplines, including psychology, sociology, and communication studies, to provide a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving field and highlight areas requiring further investigation.
