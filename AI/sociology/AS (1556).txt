Globalization's impact on local cultures remains a complex and contested area of research. While proponents emphasize increased cultural exchange and hybridity, critics highlight cultural homogenization and the erosion of traditional practices. Recent developments suggest a nuanced reality beyond simplistic dichotomies.  Studies employing mixed-methods approaches reveal a heterogeneous response to globalization, with local cultures exhibiting varying degrees of resilience and adaptation.  The digital revolution, a key driver of contemporary globalization, facilitates both the dissemination of global cultural products and the revitalization of local traditions through online platforms.  However, this digital connectivity can also exacerbate power imbalances, with dominant cultures disproportionately shaping online narratives.  Furthermore, research increasingly emphasizes the agency of local communities in negotiating globalization's effects, demonstrating their active role in selectively adopting, adapting, or resisting global influences.  Future research should focus on unpacking the diverse mechanisms through which globalization shapes cultural landscapes, paying particular attention to the interplay between global flows and local agency in shaping cultural outcomes.
