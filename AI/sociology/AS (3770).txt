Education plays a multifaceted role in shaping social norms, acting as both a transmitter and a transformer of societal values. This abstract examines the existing literature exploring this complex relationship.  Formal education transmits existing norms through curriculum content, pedagogical practices, and the hidden curriculum, reinforcing pre-existing societal expectations and behaviors.  However, education also possesses transformative potential.  Exposure to diverse perspectives within educational settings, coupled with critical thinking skills development, can challenge entrenched norms and foster the adoption of more inclusive and equitable ones.  Research highlights the efficacy of educational interventions targeting specific norms, such as gender equality or environmental sustainability, demonstrating a positive correlation between education levels and acceptance of progressive social values.  Nevertheless, the impact of education on social norms varies depending on factors such as the educational system's structure, curriculum design, teacher training, and the broader socio-cultural context. Future research should focus on disentangling these interacting factors to better understand the mechanisms through which education influences norm formation and change, thereby enabling more effective interventions aimed at promoting positive social transformation.
