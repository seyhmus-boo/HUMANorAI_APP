This lecture explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth alone is insufficient to guarantee societal progress.  Effective economic policies must consider their distributional effects and broader social impacts to foster genuine well-being.  We examine how macroeconomic policies, such as fiscal and monetary measures, influence employment rates, income inequality, and access to essential services like healthcare and education.  Furthermore, the lecture analyzes the role of social safety nets, including unemployment benefits and welfare programs, in mitigating economic hardship and promoting social stability.  The importance of inclusive growth, emphasizing equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, is highlighted as a crucial factor in achieving sustainable and equitable social well-being.  Finally, the lecture concludes by emphasizing the need for integrated policy approaches that prioritize both economic efficiency and social justice, recognizing the interdependent nature of economic prosperity and societal flourishing.  Empirical evidence and case studies illustrate the complex interplay between these two domains.
