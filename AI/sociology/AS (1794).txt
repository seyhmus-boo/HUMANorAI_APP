Globalization, characterized by intensified interconnectedness and interdependence across national boundaries, has profoundly impacted local cultures worldwide.  While the homogenizing effects of globalization have been extensively debated, recent developments necessitate a nuanced re-evaluation of this simplistic narrative.  This paper examines the multifaceted influence of globalization on local cultures, moving beyond the traditional dichotomy of cultural convergence versus divergence.  Recent research highlights the rise of "glocalization," where global trends are adapted and integrated into pre-existing local frameworks, generating hybrid cultural forms.  Furthermore, the proliferation of digital technologies, particularly social media, has facilitated both the dissemination of global cultural elements and the revitalization of localized traditions through online communities and transnational networks.  This study will analyze these contemporary dynamics, focusing on the interplay between global flows of information, capital, and people, and their consequences for cultural preservation, transformation, and resistance.  We argue that the impact of globalization on local cultures is neither uniform nor solely negative, but rather a complex process shaped by diverse factors including power dynamics, economic inequalities, and agency at the local level.
