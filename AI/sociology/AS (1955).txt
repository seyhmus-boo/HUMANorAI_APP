The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has long been a subject of intense debate and scholarly inquiry.  While traditionally approached through the lens of economics, a comprehensive understanding necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, integrating insights from sociology, psychology, political science, and public health.  This paper explores the multifaceted connections between macroeconomic strategies, microeconomic interventions, and their impact on various dimensions of social well-being, including health, education, and social equity. We move beyond a purely utilitarian perspective, acknowledging the complex interplay of factors – such as social capital, inequality, and environmental sustainability – that mediate the effectiveness of economic policies in achieving societal flourishing.  This research utilizes a mixed-methods approach, drawing on both quantitative economic data and qualitative social research to analyze the causal links and unintended consequences of different policy choices. By fostering dialogue across disciplinary boundaries, we aim to offer a more nuanced and holistic understanding of how economic policies shape societal outcomes, ultimately informing the development of more effective and equitable policies that promote genuine social progress.
