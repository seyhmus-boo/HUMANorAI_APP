This presentation examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change.  Moving beyond simplistic triumphalist or failure-oriented narratives, it explores the diverse mechanisms through which movements achieve, or fail to achieve, their objectives.  The analysis draws on a comparative framework, examining cases across different historical periods and geographical contexts, highlighting the interplay between movement strategies, organizational structures, and the broader socio-political environment.  Key themes include the significance of framing processes in shaping public opinion, the role of resource mobilization and network formation in sustaining movement activity, and the impact of state repression and co-optation on movement trajectories.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the complex relationship between social movements and institutional change, considering both the transformative potential of movements and the limitations they encounter when navigating established power structures. Ultimately, this presentation argues for a nuanced understanding of social movements as dynamic agents of change, capable of both profound societal transformations and incremental shifts in policy and public consciousness.  The discussion will conclude by considering the implications of this analysis for future research on social movements and their enduring impact on society.
