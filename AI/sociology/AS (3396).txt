This presentation explores the societal implications of class inequality through a novel lens: quantum mechanical principles. While seemingly disparate, the concepts of superposition and entanglement offer intriguing parallels to the complex, interconnected nature of societal stratification.  We posit that class, rather than being a static, definitively measurable entity, exists in a state of superposition, with individuals simultaneously occupying multiple socio-economic positions depending on context (e.g., employment, access to resources). This “quantum class” is entangled with other societal variables like health, education, and opportunity, resulting in non-local correlations.  Disparities in access to resources—the "quantum potential"—influence the probability of transitioning between class states, creating a system where certain states are more likely than others, perpetuating inequality. This entanglement further implies that interventions targeting one variable (e.g., improving education) can have cascading, non-linear effects on the overall system, highlighting the interconnected nature of tackling class inequality.  We will present a conceptual framework illustrating these principles, drawing parallels between quantum phenomena and observed societal trends, ultimately suggesting that a nuanced understanding of this "quantum class" system is vital for designing effective strategies to address societal inequities.
