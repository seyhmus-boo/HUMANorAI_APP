Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, demands an interdisciplinary approach to fully comprehend its multifaceted effects.  This presentation explores the complex interplay of economic stratification with social, political, and health outcomes, drawing on insights from sociology, economics, and public health.  We examine how socioeconomic disparities manifest in unequal access to quality education, healthcare, and housing, ultimately impacting life expectancy, social mobility, and political participation.  Sociological perspectives on social reproduction and cultural capital illuminate how class advantages are transmitted across generations, perpetuating inequalities.  Economic models highlighting wealth distribution and income inequality demonstrate the structural mechanisms underpinning these disparities.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the public health implications of class inequality, focusing on the relationship between socioeconomic status and health outcomes like chronic disease prevalence and mental health.  By integrating these diverse perspectives, we argue for a holistic understanding of class inequality, emphasizing the need for interdisciplinary collaborations in developing effective policy interventions to mitigate its detrimental societal effects and promote a more equitable future.
