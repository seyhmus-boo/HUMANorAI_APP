This presentation examines the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted consequences for societal well-being.  We move beyond simple descriptions of wealth disparity to explore the profound impact of class on key social determinants of health, educational attainment, and criminal justice outcomes.  The presentation will draw upon established sociological and economic theories, synthesizing existing literature to highlight the systemic nature of inequality and its reinforcement through various social institutions.

Specifically, we will analyze the intergenerational transmission of poverty, the limitations placed on social mobility by unequal access to resources, and the resulting polarization of political and social attitudes.  Furthermore, the presentation will explore practical applications of this research, focusing on policy interventions designed to mitigate class inequality. We will discuss the potential effectiveness of progressive taxation, targeted social welfare programs, and investments in early childhood education as mechanisms for promoting greater social equity and improving overall societal outcomes.  Finally, the presentation will conclude by outlining promising avenues for future research and advocating for a multi-pronged approach to address this enduring societal challenge.
