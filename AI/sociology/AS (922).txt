This paper investigates the pivotal role of education in shaping and transforming social norms.  While the transmission of cultural values through socialization has been extensively studied, the specific mechanisms by which formal education contributes to this process remain under-explored. We argue that education acts as a multifaceted agent of norm change, operating through both explicit and implicit curricula.  Explicitly, educational institutions directly promote certain values and behaviors through instruction and policy. Implicitly, the social interactions within educational settings, including peer influence and teacher modeling, subtly shape students' beliefs and practices.  This research examines this duality, analyzing how different educational structures and pedagogical approaches differentially impact the internalization of societal norms. We explore this relationship through a review of existing literature on educational sociology, social psychology, and cultural transmission, supplemented by empirical examples demonstrating the impact of education on diverse norm domains, including gender roles, environmental awareness, and civic engagement.  The study ultimately aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the interplay between education and social change, highlighting the potential of educational interventions to foster positive societal transformations.
