This review examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change.  While diverse in their goals and tactics, social movements consistently demonstrate a capacity to challenge existing power structures and norms.  Analysis reveals their influence extends beyond achieving immediate policy changes, encompassing broader shifts in public opinion, cultural norms, and political discourse.  Successful movements effectively utilize framing strategies to resonate with broader societal values, mobilize resources, and build coalitions across diverse groups.  However, the review also highlights the inherent challenges faced by social movements, including internal divisions, state repression, and co-optation by established institutions.  Furthermore, the impact of social media and digital technologies on movement mobilization and sustainability is explored, revealing both opportunities and limitations.  Ultimately, this review emphasizes the significant, though often complex and uneven, contribution of social movements to progressive societal transformations, underscoring the need for further research into the factors that contribute to their success or failure.  Future studies should prioritize comparative analyses across different contexts and movement types to refine theoretical understandings of their impact.
