Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and reinforcing societal norms, acting as a primary agent of socialization beyond the family unit. This paper argues that formal education transmits cultural values, beliefs, and behaviors through curricula, pedagogy, and the hidden curriculum, subtly influencing student perspectives and actions.  Explicit instruction on civic responsibility and social etiquette directly contributes to norm internalization.  Furthermore, the hidden curriculum, encompassing implicit rules and expectations within the educational environment, shapes social interactions, power dynamics, and acceptable conduct.  The peer group influence within educational settings significantly amplifies this process, solidifying norms through social learning and conformity.  While education can propagate existing norms, it also possesses the potential to challenge and reform them.  Critical pedagogy and inclusive curricula can foster reflection on societal structures and encourage the development of more equitable and just norms.  However, achieving this requires conscious effort to address power imbalances and diversify perspectives within educational systems.  Future research should explore the nuanced interplay between educational practices and evolving social norms across diverse contexts.
