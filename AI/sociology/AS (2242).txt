This presentation examines the pivotal role of education in shaping and transforming social norms.  While often viewed as a conduit for knowledge transmission, educational institutions exert a profound influence on societal values and behaviors.  We argue that education's impact extends beyond curriculum content, encompassing the implicit socialization occurring within the school environment.  This presentation will explore three key mechanisms:  the transmission of explicit values through curricula (e.g., civic education, character development programs), the implicit socialization through peer interactions and teacher-student dynamics (e.g., reinforcement of gender roles, promotion of conformity), and the empowerment fostered through critical thinking and awareness-raising initiatives (e.g., challenging existing power structures, promoting social justice).  Using a mixed-methods approach, incorporating sociological and psychological frameworks, we analyze the effectiveness of various educational strategies in promoting positive social change.  Our findings highlight the complex interplay between formal and informal learning environments, illustrating how educational institutions can either reinforce existing norms or contribute to their evolution towards more equitable and sustainable societal structures.  The presentation will conclude by offering recommendations for educators and policymakers to harness education's transformative potential for positive social change.
