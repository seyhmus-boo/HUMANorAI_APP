This review examines the multifaceted impact of urbanization on community life, synthesizing existing literature on social cohesion, civic engagement, and the built environment.  While urbanization offers economic opportunities and access to amenities, it frequently undermines traditional community structures.  Studies consistently demonstrate a correlation between increasing population density and decreased social capital, manifested in reduced neighbourly interaction and a decline in informal social support networks.  The anonymity fostered by large urban settings can hinder the development of strong community bonds, potentially leading to social isolation and increased crime rates.  However, the negative impacts are not inevitable.  Effective urban planning, including the creation of accessible public spaces, the promotion of mixed-use developments, and investment in community-based initiatives, can mitigate these challenges.  This review concludes that although urbanization presents significant threats to community life, proactive strategies are crucial in fostering vibrant, inclusive, and resilient urban communities that prioritize social wellbeing alongside economic growth. Further research is needed to explore the effectiveness of diverse interventions designed to bolster social cohesion in rapidly expanding urban areas.
