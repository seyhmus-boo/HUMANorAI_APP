This presentation explores the multifaceted and often contradictory effects of globalization on local cultures, focusing on the methodological challenges inherent in empirically investigating such a complex phenomenon.  While globalization is often framed as a homogenizing force, empirical evidence reveals a far more nuanced reality, encompassing cultural hybridity, resistance, and adaptation.  The research presented highlights the difficulties in isolating the impact of globalization from other contributing factors such as technological advancements, internal social dynamics, and political interventions.

We discuss the limitations of traditional quantitative approaches, such as surveys, in capturing the subtle and subjective aspects of cultural change.  The inherent biases in sampling techniques and the difficulties in establishing clear causal links between globalization processes and specific cultural outcomes are critically examined.  Furthermore, the presentation will explore the ethical considerations associated with researching cultural change, including issues of representation and potential for researcher influence.  Finally, we propose an integrated methodology combining qualitative ethnographic methods, such as participant observation and in-depth interviews, with quantitative data analysis to provide a more robust and nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between globalization and local cultural dynamics. This integrated approach offers a more complete picture, overcoming some limitations of purely experimental or purely observational studies.
