The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has long been a central theme in the social sciences.  While traditional economic models often prioritized GDP growth as the sole indicator of societal progress, a growing body of research acknowledges the multifaceted nature of well-being and its complex interplay with economic factors.  Recent developments highlight a shift away from purely macroeconomic perspectives, incorporating diverse measures of social well-being, including health, education, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion.  This nuanced approach acknowledges that economic prosperity, while essential, is insufficient to guarantee a flourishing society.

Recent empirical studies leveraging longitudinal data and advanced econometric techniques offer increasingly sophisticated analyses of policy impacts on various well-being dimensions.  For example, research exploring the effects of minimum wage increases on poverty reduction or the impact of universal basic income pilot programs on mental health and financial stability is significantly expanding our understanding.  Furthermore, the increasing awareness of environmental and social externalities has spurred investigations into the trade-offs between economic growth and long-term sustainability, challenging the traditional growth-centric paradigm. This paper examines the multifaceted nature of this relationship, focusing on recent theoretical and empirical advances to assess the effectiveness of various economic policies in fostering genuine social progress, beyond purely economic indicators.
