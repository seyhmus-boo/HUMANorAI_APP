This lecture examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth alone is insufficient for achieving holistic societal progress.  While robust economic performance, facilitated by policies such as investment in infrastructure and human capital, demonstrably improves material living standards and reduces poverty, its impact on social well-being is mediated by several factors.  Distributional effects, for instance, are crucial: policies promoting equitable wealth distribution are essential to mitigate inequalities and enhance social cohesion.  Furthermore,  the pursuit of economic growth must not come at the expense of environmental sustainability or social justice. Policies neglecting these aspects, such as unchecked industrialization or insufficient social safety nets, can lead to negative externalities undermining long-term social well-being.  Ultimately, a balanced approach is required, integrating economic objectives with social considerations, fostering inclusive growth, and prioritizing sustainable development to ensure a just and prosperous society.  This necessitates a holistic policy framework that accounts for both economic indicators and qualitative measures of social progress.
