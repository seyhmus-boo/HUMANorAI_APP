Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, demanding nuanced analysis beyond simple homogenization narratives. This presentation explores the historical trajectory of this interaction, tracing its roots from early mercantile expansion to the contemporary era of hyper-connectivity.  While earlier forms of globalization, such as colonialism, often resulted in cultural dominance and suppression, the contemporary landscape exhibits a more dynamic interplay. We will examine the tensions between global homogenizing forces, exemplified by the spread of transnational media and consumerism, and the resilience and adaptation of local cultures. This includes analyzing processes of cultural hybridity, where global and local elements merge to create unique expressions, and instances of cultural revitalization, driven by local communities seeking to protect their heritage in the face of external pressures. The presentation will argue that globalization does not necessarily lead to the erasure of local cultures, but rather fosters a complex negotiation between global forces and local agency, resulting in diverse and often unpredictable outcomes. Empirical examples drawn from various cultural contexts will illustrate these complexities and offer a more nuanced understanding of this ongoing process.
