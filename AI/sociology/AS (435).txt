Class inequality, a persistent societal feature throughout history, manifests as the uneven distribution of resources, opportunities, and power across social strata.  Historically, feudal systems rigidly defined class hierarchies based on land ownership and inherited status.  The industrial revolution, while generating wealth, exacerbated inequality, creating a burgeoning proletariat exploited by a powerful capitalist class.  This period witnessed the rise of Marxist thought, emphasizing class struggle as the engine of historical change and the inherent instability of capitalist systems due to their unequal distribution of capital.

Contemporary manifestations of class inequality are nuanced but equally impactful.  While overt feudal structures have largely dissolved, disparities in wealth, income, education, and healthcare persist, often reproducing themselves across generations.  This has significant societal consequences, contributing to diminished social mobility, increased crime rates, poorer health outcomes for lower classes, and political polarization.  The concentration of wealth in the hands of a few limits democratic participation and fuels social unrest.  Addressing class inequality requires multifaceted approaches encompassing progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, investment in education and healthcare, and policies promoting fairer labor practices.  Understanding its historical roots is crucial for effectively tackling its contemporary challenges.
