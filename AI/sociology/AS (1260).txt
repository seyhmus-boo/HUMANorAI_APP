Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, exerts profound and multifaceted effects across various societal domains, necessitating an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding.  Economic disparities, a core element of class inequality, are demonstrably linked to disparities in health outcomes, as evidenced by sociological studies showing a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and life expectancy, morbidity rates, and access to quality healthcare.  Psychological research further reveals the detrimental impact of economic insecurity and social stratification on mental health, leading to increased rates of stress, anxiety, and depression among lower socioeconomic groups.  Moreover, political science studies highlight how class inequality contributes to political instability and reduced social cohesion, manifesting in decreased voter turnout, heightened social unrest, and the erosion of democratic institutions.  Critically, anthropological perspectives illuminate the cultural reproduction of class inequalities across generations, revealing how ingrained societal norms and practices perpetuate socioeconomic disparities.  Ultimately, a holistic comprehension of class inequality requires a synthesis of economic, sociological, psychological, political, and anthropological insights, demonstrating the intricate interconnectedness of this complex social issue.
