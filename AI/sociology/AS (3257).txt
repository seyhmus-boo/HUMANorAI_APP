Social movements, collective actions aimed at achieving social or political change, play a crucial role in reshaping societal structures and norms.  Recent scholarship highlights the increasingly networked and fluid nature of these movements, facilitated by digital technologies.  While traditional models emphasized centralized leadership and clear-cut goals, contemporary movements often exhibit decentralized organization, leveraging social media for mobilization, communication, and framing. This decentralized structure allows for greater inclusivity but also presents challenges in maintaining cohesion and achieving concrete objectives.

Recent developments underscore the significance of framing strategies in shaping public perception and garnering support. Movements skillfully employ narrative construction and symbolic action to resonate with broader societal values and concerns, influencing public opinion and pressuring political actors.  However, the digital sphere also presents vulnerabilities, including the spread of misinformation and the manipulation of narratives by counter-movements and state actors.  Furthermore, the efficacy of social movements remains contingent upon factors such as existing power structures, institutional responsiveness, and the mobilization of resources.  Analyzing the intersection of these factors provides a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between social movements and societal change in the contemporary era.
