This presentation explores the multifaceted role of education in shaping and transforming social norms, drawing upon insights from sociology, psychology, and pedagogy.  We argue that education acts not merely as a transmitter of knowledge, but as a powerful agent of socialization, influencing individuals' beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors.  Through curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the hidden curriculum, educational institutions actively contribute to the reproduction or subversion of existing norms.

We will analyze the interplay between formal and informal learning environments, highlighting how peer interactions, teacher expectations, and institutional structures collectively impact norm internalization.  Furthermore, we will examine the efficacy of different educational strategies in promoting positive social change, such as promoting critical thinking, fostering empathy, and encouraging intercultural understanding.  By exploring interdisciplinary perspectives, we aim to identify key mechanisms through which education shapes social norms and discuss implications for curriculum development and educational policy.  Ultimately, we posit that a more nuanced understanding of this complex relationship is crucial for designing effective interventions aimed at fostering socially responsible and equitable societies.
