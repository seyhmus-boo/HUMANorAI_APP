Globalization's impact on local cultures remains a complex and contested area of study. This presentation examines recent developments in the ongoing interplay between global homogenizing forces and the resilience of local traditions.  While concerns regarding cultural erosion due to the spread of global media, consumerism, and migratory flows persist,  recent research highlights a nuanced reality.  We analyze evidence suggesting that globalization doesn't solely lead to cultural dilution, but can also stimulate cultural hybridity and revitalization.  Specifically, the presentation will explore the rise of "glocalization," where global trends are adapted and reinterpreted within local contexts, creating unique cultural blends.  Furthermore, we will examine the role of digital technologies in facilitating both cultural exchange and the preservation of indigenous languages and practices.  By focusing on case studies from diverse regions, this presentation argues that the effects of globalization on local cultures are far from uniform and are shaped by pre-existing power dynamics, socio-economic factors, and agency of local communities.  Finally, we discuss the implications for cultural policy and the need for frameworks that support cultural diversity in an increasingly interconnected world.
