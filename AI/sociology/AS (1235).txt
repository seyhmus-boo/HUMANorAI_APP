This presentation examines the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted detrimental effects on societal well-being.  Focusing on a multi-dimensional approach, we move beyond a purely economic definition of class, incorporating social capital, cultural capital, and access to resources as key determinants of inequality. We argue that the existing class structure significantly influences health outcomes, educational attainment, and opportunities for social mobility.  Drawing upon recent sociological and economic research, we present evidence demonstrating the correlation between class inequality and increased rates of crime, mental health issues, and political polarization. Furthermore, we analyze the intergenerational transmission of disadvantage, highlighting the cyclical nature of poverty and its impact on long-term social stratification.  The presentation concludes by briefly discussing potential policy interventions aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of class inequality, including investments in early childhood education, progressive taxation, and initiatives promoting social inclusion.  Ultimately, we contend that addressing class inequality is crucial for fostering a more equitable, just, and prosperous society.
