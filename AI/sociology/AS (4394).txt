This presentation examines the experimental challenges inherent in researching the multifaceted impacts of class inequality on society.  While observational studies readily demonstrate correlations between socioeconomic status and a range of social outcomes – health, education, crime – establishing causal relationships remains elusive.  We discuss the limitations of existing experimental designs, highlighting the difficulty in manipulating class status ethically and practically.  Randomized controlled trials, while the gold standard, face significant logistical hurdles, including the cost and complexity of long-term interventions targeting large population segments.  Furthermore, the inherent multidimensionality of class, encompassing income, wealth, occupation, and social capital, complicates the isolation of specific causal mechanisms.  We critically analyze quasi-experimental methods, such as regression discontinuity designs and instrumental variables, evaluating their strengths and weaknesses in mitigating confounding factors and establishing causal inferences.  Finally, we propose avenues for future research, emphasizing the need for innovative experimental designs that leverage naturally occurring variations in social contexts and incorporate mixed-methods approaches to overcome the inherent limitations of solely quantitative methodologies.  The aim is to foster a more robust understanding of the causal pathways linking class inequality to societal disparities.
