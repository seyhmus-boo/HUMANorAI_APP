Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to fully grasp its complex effects. This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of class inequality, drawing upon insights from sociology, economics, and political science.  We will examine how socioeconomic disparities manifest in unequal access to resources, such as quality education, healthcare, and housing, thereby perpetuating cycles of disadvantage.  Economic analyses will highlight the role of unequal income distribution and wealth concentration in driving social stratification and limiting upward mobility.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the political implications of class inequality, including its influence on electoral outcomes, policymaking, and the erosion of democratic participation.  By integrating sociological perspectives on social mobility and cultural capital, we will analyze how class inequality shapes social identities, attitudes, and behaviors, contributing to social fragmentation and potentially fueling social unrest.  Ultimately, this presentation argues for a more holistic and interdisciplinary understanding of class inequality to facilitate the development of effective and equitable societal interventions.
