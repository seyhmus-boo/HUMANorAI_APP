The pervasive influence of social media on contemporary human behavior presents a complex and multifaceted research challenge.  Its impact can be likened to a pervasive atmospheric shift: subtle yet profoundly altering the landscape of human interaction.  Just as the introduction of electricity fundamentally reshaped daily life, social media has infiltrated nearly every aspect of modern existence, from interpersonal relationships to political discourse.  However, unlike the readily observable effects of electricity, the impact of social media is less tangible, resembling a silent, pervasive current subtly influencing the flow of information and social behaviour.  This paper examines this "current," exploring the multifaceted ways in which social media platforms shape human behavior, drawing parallels to established social psychological theories and phenomena.  We will investigate how the architecture of these platforms – their algorithms, design features, and affordances – acts as a scaffolding for the construction of identity, the formation of social bonds, and the dissemination of ideas, much like a sculptor uses a framework to shape their art.  Through a review of existing literature and a proposed conceptual framework, this research aims to illuminate the intricate and often paradoxical effects of this increasingly ubiquitous technological force.
