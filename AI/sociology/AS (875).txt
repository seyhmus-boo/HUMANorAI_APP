Applying a quantum mechanical analogy to class inequality illuminates its societal effects.  We can consider societal strata as distinct energy levels within a social system.  Individuals, analogous to particles, occupy these levels with varying probabilities, dictated by socioeconomic factors acting as potentials.  High class individuals reside in low-energy, stable states, possessing substantial "social capital" –  a form of potential energy.  Conversely, lower classes occupy high-energy, unstable states, characterized by precariousness and limited resources.

The large energy gap between these states represents entrenched inequality.  Transitions between levels – social mobility – are hindered by high potential barriers, analogous to activation energy in chemical reactions.  These barriers manifest as systemic biases, limited access to education and resources, and generational disadvantages.  A significant energy imbalance results in societal instability, mirroring a highly excited system prone to spontaneous transitions, such as social unrest or revolution.  Furthermore, the superposition principle suggests individuals might exist in a probabilistic state, simultaneously experiencing the benefits and deprivations associated with different social levels.  This ambiguity contributes to social fragmentation and hinders collective action to overcome inequality. The resulting system, far from equilibrium, exhibits significant societal entropy, manifesting as reduced overall well-being and diminished societal cohesion.
