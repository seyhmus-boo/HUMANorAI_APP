Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and transmitting social norms, acting as both a conservator and a catalyst for change.  Formal education systems, through curricula and pedagogy, actively socialize individuals into existing societal expectations, reinforcing norms related to behaviour, morality, and social hierarchies.  This transmission occurs implicitly through the hidden curriculum – the unspoken values and beliefs embedded within the educational structure – and explicitly through subjects like civics and social studies.  

However, education is not merely a passive conveyor of norms.  It also functions as a space for critical examination and potential reform.  Exposure to diverse perspectives and critical thinking skills within educational settings can challenge established norms and foster social change.  For instance, inclusive education initiatives actively promote tolerance and challenge discriminatory norms.

Practical applications of this understanding include designing curricula that explicitly address social issues, promoting critical pedagogy to empower students to question norms, and integrating culturally diverse perspectives to foster inclusivity.  By carefully curating educational experiences, societies can leverage education to both maintain social cohesion and facilitate positive social evolution.
