Globalization's impact on local cultures is a subject of ongoing debate, with narratives ranging from homogenization to hybridity.  While numerous studies have explored this complex relationship through observational and comparative methodologies, rigorous experimental investigation remains comparatively limited. This paper addresses this gap by focusing on the inherent challenges of designing experiments to effectively isolate and measure globalization's influence on cultural practices.  Specifically, we examine the difficulties associated with defining and operationalizing "globalization" itself, given its multifaceted nature encompassing economic, technological, and social processes that interact dynamically and unevenly across localities.  Further, isolating the impact of globalization from other concurrent social and economic changes poses a significant methodological hurdle. The paper explores various experimental designs, including field experiments, natural experiments leveraging exogenous shocks, and the potential of agent-based modeling, acknowledging the limitations and ethical considerations of each. We ultimately argue that a multi-method approach, combining experimental designs with qualitative data collection, is necessary to achieve a nuanced understanding of globalization's complex and often unpredictable effects on the diverse tapestry of local cultures.
