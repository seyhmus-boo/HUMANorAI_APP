This presentation explores the multifaceted role of education in shaping and transforming social norms, drawing upon insights from sociology, psychology, and anthropology.  We argue that education acts not merely as a transmitter of knowledge but as a crucial socialising agent, influencing attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours that underpin societal norms.  Through the curriculum, pedagogy, and the broader school environment, educational institutions actively construct and reinforce (or challenge) prevailing social norms around topics such as gender, race, class, and environmental responsibility.

The presentation will examine the interplay between formal and informal learning processes within educational settings.  We will discuss how sociological concepts like social reproduction and habitus illuminate the ways in which education can perpetuate existing inequalities by reinforcing dominant norms.  Conversely, we will explore how psychological principles of social learning and cognitive development can inform the design of effective educational interventions aimed at promoting positive social change and challenging discriminatory norms.  Finally, drawing upon anthropological perspectives, we will analyze the role of cultural context in shaping the effectiveness of educational strategies for norm transformation.  The presentation concludes by highlighting the interdisciplinary potential for developing more effective and equitable educational approaches capable of fostering positive societal shifts through norm change.
