The rigid delineation of gender roles, once considered a cornerstone of societal structure, is undergoing rapid transformation in modern societies. This paper explores the complex and multifaceted evolution of gender roles, drawing upon an interdisciplinary framework to illuminate the interplay of sociological, psychological, anthropological, and economic factors driving this ongoing shift.  We move beyond simplistic narratives of progress, acknowledging the persistent inequalities and complexities inherent in the process. Sociological perspectives, focusing on social institutions and power dynamics, will be central in analyzing the impact of legislation, education, and media representation on evolving gender norms.  Psychological analyses will contribute insights into the internalization of gender roles and their effect on individual identity and well-being.  Furthermore, anthropological studies provide valuable cross-cultural comparisons, highlighting the diversity of gender expressions and challenging universalized models. Finally, economic perspectives will examine the influence of labor market participation, wage gaps, and access to resources on gender equality and the reshaping of traditional family structures. By integrating these diverse lenses, this research aims to offer a nuanced understanding of the ongoing evolution of gender roles and its profound implications for contemporary societies.
