This paper explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  We posit that while economic growth is often cited as a primary objective, its impact on social well-being is neither direct nor uniformly positive.  The effectiveness of economic policies in improving social well-being hinges on their distributional effects and their alignment with broader social goals.  Policies focused solely on macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP growth, may exacerbate inequality and neglect crucial social determinants of health and happiness, including access to quality healthcare, education, and social safety nets. Conversely, policies prioritizing social inclusion, such as progressive taxation and robust social security systems, can contribute to greater equity and improved well-being, even if accompanied by moderate economic growth.  This study argues for a multidimensional approach to policy evaluation, integrating economic metrics with indicators of social progress, including measures of health, education, and environmental sustainability.  Only through such a holistic framework can the true impact of economic policies on the well-being of society be accurately assessed and optimized.
