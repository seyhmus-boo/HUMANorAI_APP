Globalization's impact on local cultures remains a complex and hotly debated topic.  This presentation examines recent developments highlighting both the homogenizing and heterogenizing effects of interconnectedness. While concerns about cultural erosion due to the dominance of global media and consumerism persist, a nuanced understanding reveals a more intricate reality.  Recent research demonstrates the resilience of local cultures, often manifested through adaptation and hybridity.  We explore the rise of "glocalization," where global trends are adapted to local contexts, resulting in unique cultural expressions.  Furthermore, the digital revolution, while initially perceived as a homogenizing force, has also facilitated the revitalization of marginalized languages and traditions through online communities and digital platforms.  The presentation will analyze case studies illustrating these contrasting trends, focusing on the role of social media in cultural preservation and the ongoing negotiation between global and local identities in a rapidly changing world.  It concludes by emphasizing the need for critical engagement with globalization's multifaceted effects, acknowledging both its challenges and its potential to foster intercultural dialogue and creativity.
