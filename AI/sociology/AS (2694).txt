Class inequality, characterized by the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities across societal strata, exerts profound and multifaceted effects on societal well-being. This abstract reviews the extant literature demonstrating the detrimental consequences of high levels of class inequality.  Empirical evidence consistently links greater inequality to reduced social mobility, hindering individual advancement and perpetuating intergenerational disadvantage.  Furthermore, high inequality correlates with increased crime rates, poorer physical and mental health outcomes across the population, and diminished social cohesion, evidenced by lower levels of trust and civic engagement.  These effects are mediated by various mechanisms, including unequal access to quality education, healthcare, and political influence, which exacerbate existing disparities.  The resulting polarization can destabilize democratic institutions and foster social unrest.  Addressing class inequality necessitates multi-pronged interventions targeting education reform, progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and policies promoting fair labor practices.  Future research should focus on longitudinal studies exploring the causal pathways between specific inequality measures and downstream societal impacts, refining our understanding of effective mitigation strategies.
