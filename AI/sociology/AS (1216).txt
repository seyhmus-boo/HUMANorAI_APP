This presentation explores the ongoing evolution of gender roles in contemporary societies, drawing on insights from sociology, anthropology, economics, and psychology.  We move beyond simplistic binary understandings of gender to acknowledge the complex interplay of biological, social, and cultural factors shaping gender identity and performance.  The analysis examines the multifaceted impact of globalization, technological advancements, and shifting economic structures on traditional gender divisions of labor, familial roles, and power dynamics.  Specific attention is paid to the increasing visibility and acceptance of non-binary genders and the persistent challenges to gender equality despite significant legislative and social progress.  By integrating perspectives from diverse disciplines, we aim to illuminate the nuanced and often contradictory processes driving the transformation of gender roles.  The presentation will highlight how economic indicators (e.g., wage gaps, occupational segregation) correlate with sociological findings on gendered social norms and psychological research on gender identity formation.  Ultimately, we argue for a more interdisciplinary approach to understanding this crucial societal shift, emphasizing the need for collaborative research to effectively address persistent inequalities and promote genuine gender inclusivity.
