This presentation examines the enduring problem of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on society.  Historically, class structures have manifested in diverse forms, from ancient slave societies to feudal systems and the modern capitalist model. While the specific mechanisms of stratification have evolved, the fundamental disparity in access to resources, power, and opportunities has persisted.  This presentation will trace the historical evolution of class inequality, highlighting key transitions and shifts in the nature of its manifestation.

We will explore the contemporary consequences of this enduring inequality, focusing on its impact on key societal indicators such as health outcomes, educational attainment, and criminal justice involvement.  Empirical evidence will demonstrate the robust correlation between socioeconomic status and these critical areas. Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the social and political ramifications of high levels of inequality, including increased social unrest, political polarization, and reduced social mobility.  Finally, we will briefly discuss potential avenues for mitigating class inequality, acknowledging the complexities and challenges inherent in addressing this deeply entrenched societal issue.  The overall aim is to provide a concise overview of the historical trajectory and contemporary implications of class inequality, stimulating discussion and further research into this crucial topic.
