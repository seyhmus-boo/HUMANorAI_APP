Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, exerts profound and multifaceted effects across various societal domains. This review examines existing literature exploring the relationship between class stratification and its consequences, focusing on health, education, and political participation.  Studies consistently demonstrate a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and health outcomes, with lower-class individuals experiencing higher rates of morbidity and mortality due to limited access to quality healthcare and increased exposure to environmental hazards.  Educational attainment is significantly impacted, as disadvantaged backgrounds often limit access to resources and opportunities, perpetuating intergenerational inequality.  Furthermore, political disenfranchisement is evident, with lower-class individuals exhibiting lower voter turnout and reduced political influence, contributing to a democratic deficit.  The cumulative effect of these disparities reinforces existing inequalities, hindering social mobility and fostering social unrest.  Addressing class inequality requires multifaceted interventions targeting resource allocation, educational reform, and policies promoting social justice and equitable opportunities. Future research should focus on longitudinal studies exploring the complex interplay between various factors contributing to and resulting from class inequality.
