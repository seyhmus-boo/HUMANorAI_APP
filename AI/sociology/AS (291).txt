Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, play a crucial role in driving societal change.  This paper explores the multifaceted nature of social movements, highlighting the critical interplay between various disciplines for a comprehensive understanding of their emergence, dynamics, and impact.  Drawing on insights from sociology, political science, history, and psychology, we analyze how social movements leverage collective identity formation, resource mobilization, framing processes, and strategic action to challenge existing power structures and advocate for alternative social arrangements.  Interdisciplinary perspectives are essential in examining the complex interplay between movement structures, mobilization strategies, and the broader socio-political context, including the role of media, state responses, and counter-movements.  Furthermore, we consider the lasting effects of movements, encompassing both intended and unintended consequences, and address the enduring debate surrounding their efficacy in achieving lasting societal transformation.  Empirical evidence demonstrates the importance of incorporating insights from diverse disciplines to illuminate the complex mechanisms through which social movements contribute to—and are shaped by—ongoing societal shifts.
