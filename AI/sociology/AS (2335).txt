This presentation examines the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on society, drawing upon insights from sociology, economics, and political science.  We argue that a purely disciplinary approach fails to capture the complexity of class stratification and its consequences.  Focusing on the interdisciplinary linkages, we will explore how economic disparities manifest in differential access to education, healthcare, and political participation, as documented by sociological research on social mobility and stratification.  Economic models illustrating wealth concentration and its impact on social mobility will be juxtaposed with political science analyses of the influence of money in politics and the erosion of democratic accountability.  Furthermore, we will consider the psychological impacts of class inequality, highlighting research on stress, mental health, and the reproduction of class-based inequalities across generations. By weaving together these different perspectives, the presentation aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the societal ramifications of class inequality, advocating for a more integrated and interdisciplinary approach to addressing this persistent social challenge.  Finally, we will briefly discuss potential policy implications derived from this multi-faceted analysis.
