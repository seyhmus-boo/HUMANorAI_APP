The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, a topic of ongoing academic debate.  Traditionally, economic policies focused heavily on macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth, often neglecting distributive effects.  However, recent developments highlight a shift towards a more holistic approach.  The rise of the “well-being” agenda, evident in initiatives like the OECD's Better Life Index, underscores a growing recognition that economic growth alone is insufficient for societal progress.

Recent research increasingly emphasizes the importance of policies promoting social inclusion and reducing inequality as vital components of broader well-being. This involves examining the impacts of taxation, social safety nets, and labor market regulations on factors like health, education, and social cohesion.  For example, universal basic income trials are informing policy discussions on mitigating poverty and income inequality, while investments in human capital are recognized as crucial drivers of long-term economic prosperity and improved quality of life.  Furthermore, the growing awareness of environmental sustainability has integrated ecological concerns into the economic policy equation, acknowledging their profound implications for future well-being.  This evolving perspective emphasizes a need to move beyond narrow economic metrics toward a more comprehensive evaluation of societal progress.
