The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being remains a central concern in contemporary political economy.  While traditional macroeconomic models often prioritize economic growth as the primary indicator of success, a growing body of research emphasizes the need for a more nuanced understanding of the distributional effects of economic policies and their impact on various dimensions of social well-being.  Recent developments, particularly the increasing awareness of widening income inequality and the persistent challenges of social mobility, have spurred renewed interest in this multifaceted field.  This paper examines this dynamic relationship, moving beyond simplistic correlations to explore the causal pathways linking specific economic policies to measurable improvements or deteriorations in social well-being.  We consider recent theoretical advances that account for factors like social capital, health outcomes, and environmental sustainability, alongside empirical analyses incorporating more robust methodologies and datasets, including large-scale longitudinal studies and advanced econometric techniques.  The analysis will focus on specific policy areas, such as taxation, social safety nets, and labor market regulations, assessing their effectiveness in promoting equitable and sustainable development that enhances the overall social well-being of populations.
