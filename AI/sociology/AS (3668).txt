Urbanization, the increasing concentration of human populations in urban areas, is a defining feature of the 21st century, profoundly impacting the fabric of community life. This research explores the multifaceted consequences of urbanization on community structures and dynamics, highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary nature of understanding this complex phenomenon.  Traditional sociological analyses of community breakdown and social capital erosion are insufficient to fully capture the scope of the issue.  This study therefore draws upon insights from multiple disciplines, including urban planning, geography, public health, and environmental studies, to provide a more holistic perspective.  We examine how physical urban design, accessibility to resources, and environmental factors intersect with social interactions, influencing community cohesion, social inequalities, and residents' well-being.  Specifically, we investigate the relationship between urban density and social connectedness, the impact of infrastructure development on community participation, and the environmental justice implications of uneven urbanization patterns.  By integrating these diverse disciplinary lenses, this research aims to contribute a richer understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by urbanization for fostering vibrant and sustainable community life.
