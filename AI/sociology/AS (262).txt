This presentation examines the pivotal role of education in shaping and reshaping social norms across historical periods.  Historically, educational systems have often served to reinforce existing power structures and societal hierarchies, transmitting dominant norms and values through curricula and pedagogy.  Examples range from the classical education promoting elite civic virtue to the mass education systems of the 20th century reinforcing national identities and ideologies.  However, education has also been a crucial site of social change, challenging prevailing norms and fostering alternative values.

The abstract will analyze how educational institutions, through curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the hidden curriculum, influence the internalization of social norms related to gender, race, class, and sexuality.  Furthermore, it will explore the dynamic interplay between education and social movements, demonstrating how educational reform initiatives have been instrumental in challenging discriminatory practices and advocating for inclusivity.  By examining historical case studies and contemporary examples, this presentation aims to illuminate the complex and multifaceted relationship between education and social norms, highlighting both its conservative and transformative potential.  It concludes by considering the implications for contemporary educational practices and their capacity to promote equitable and socially just societies.
