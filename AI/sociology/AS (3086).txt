This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidimensional focus on economic growth alone is insufficient for achieving broad societal flourishing.  We analyze the complex interplay between various economic policy instruments – including fiscal, monetary, and trade policies – and their multifaceted impacts on key social indicators.  Specifically, we examine how policies designed to stimulate economic growth can inadvertently exacerbate social inequalities, potentially leading to decreased well-being for marginalized groups.  Conversely, we investigate the potential for policies prioritizing social justice, such as progressive taxation and robust social safety nets, to foster both equitable growth and improved societal well-being.  Drawing upon both theoretical frameworks and empirical evidence from diverse national contexts, the presentation will critically assess the effectiveness of different policy approaches in promoting inclusive and sustainable development.  Finally, we propose a framework for evaluating economic policies through a lens of social well-being, incorporating indicators beyond GDP to provide a more holistic assessment of societal progress.  This framework advocates for a policy shift that prioritizes human development and social justice alongside economic growth, ultimately aiming for a more equitable and flourishing society.
