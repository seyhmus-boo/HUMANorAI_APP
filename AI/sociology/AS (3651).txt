Social movements, collective actions aiming to effect societal change, have undergone significant transformations in recent decades.  While traditional models emphasized centralized organization and clear-cut goals, contemporary movements increasingly exhibit decentralized structures facilitated by digital technologies.  Online platforms enable rapid mobilization, information dissemination, and cross-border solidarity, fostering globalized activism.  However, this digital affordance also presents challenges, including the spread of misinformation and the potential for echo chambers to reinforce existing biases, hindering inclusive participation.  Recent scholarship emphasizes the interplay between online and offline mobilization, highlighting the crucial role of "bridging social capital" in translating digital engagement into real-world impact.  Moreover, research increasingly investigates the complex relationship between movement tactics and outcomes, challenging simplistic cause-and-effect narratives.  Future research should focus on understanding the long-term impacts of digitally mediated activism, the effectiveness of diverse mobilization strategies, and the evolving relationship between social movements and state power in an increasingly interconnected world.  Analyzing these dynamics is crucial for understanding the ongoing evolution of societal change.
