Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, play a significant role in shaping societal change.  This paper examines the mechanisms through which movements influence societal transformation, focusing on three key areas:  agenda-setting, framing, and mobilization.  We argue that successful movements effectively place issues on the public agenda, framing their demands in ways that resonate with broader societal values and norms.  This framing process involves constructing narratives that connect individual experiences to wider systemic issues, fostering a sense of collective identity and urgency.  Furthermore, effective mobilization strategies, including resource acquisition, network building, and strategic communication, are crucial for sustaining momentum and achieving desired outcomes.  We analyze diverse case studies, including the Civil Rights Movement and the environmental movement, to illustrate the varied approaches and outcomes associated with different movement strategies. The paper concludes by highlighting the contextual factors that influence movement success, including state repression, pre-existing social networks, and the broader political climate, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between movements and the societal structures they seek to transform.  Future research should focus on developing more nuanced theoretical models that account for the complex interactions between these factors and the long-term consequences of social movement activity.
