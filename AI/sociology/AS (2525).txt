Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex and multifaceted issue demanding an interdisciplinary approach. This presentation explores the multifaceted effects of globalization, drawing upon anthropology, sociology, economics, and media studies to offer a nuanced understanding.  We will examine how economic liberalization, facilitated by global trade and investment, influences cultural production and consumption patterns, potentially leading to both cultural homogenization and hybridity.  The role of media globalization in disseminating dominant cultural narratives and influencing local identities will be critically analyzed, acknowledging the agency of local communities in adapting and resisting global forces.  Furthermore, the presentation will investigate the tensions between globalized cultural products and the preservation of traditional practices, exploring the strategies employed by communities to maintain cultural distinctiveness in a globalized world. By integrating perspectives from various disciplines, this presentation aims to move beyond simplistic narratives of cultural loss or dominance, offering a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between globalization and local cultural resilience.
