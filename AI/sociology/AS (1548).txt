Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, significantly impacts various aspects of social life, from health outcomes to political participation.  This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in researching the multifaceted effects of class inequality. While observational studies readily reveal correlations, establishing causal links necessitates robust experimental designs that are often difficult, if not impossible, to implement ethically and practically.  We examine limitations of existing methodologies, such as the challenges in randomly assigning individuals to different class strata, the ethical considerations of manipulating socioeconomic status, and the difficulties in controlling for confounding variables across long-term studies.  The presentation critically evaluates the use of natural experiments, such as policy interventions or unforeseen economic shocks, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in isolating the effect of class inequality.  Furthermore, we discuss emerging methodological approaches, including agent-based modeling and field experiments with carefully designed interventions, as potential avenues for overcoming some of these experimental challenges.  Finally, we propose a framework for future research focusing on ethically sound and methodologically rigorous approaches to better understand the causal mechanisms linking class inequality to its diverse societal consequences.
