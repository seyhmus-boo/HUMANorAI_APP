This presentation explores the complex interplay between cultural diversity and social integration, focusing on recent developments in the field.  While increased migration and globalization have fostered unprecedented levels of cultural diversity in many societies, the impact on social integration remains a contested issue.  Recent research highlights the nuanced relationship between diversity and integration, challenging simplistic narratives of either conflict or harmony.  We will examine emerging theoretical frameworks that move beyond assimilationist models, emphasizing the importance of intercultural dialogue and inclusive policies.  Specific attention will be given to the role of digital technologies in facilitating both integration and exclusion, as online spaces can amplify existing social divisions or foster new forms of community.  Furthermore, we will discuss the limitations of existing integration measures and propose alternative approaches rooted in participatory research and community-led initiatives.  Ultimately, this presentation argues that successful social integration requires a proactive, nuanced understanding of cultural diversity, moving beyond tolerance towards genuine inclusivity and equity.  The presentation will conclude by highlighting key policy implications for fostering social cohesion in diverse societies.
