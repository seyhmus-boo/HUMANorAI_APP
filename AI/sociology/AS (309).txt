Social movements, collective actions aiming to effect societal change, play a crucial role in challenging existing power structures and driving transformative processes.  Recent scholarship emphasizes their fluidity and diverse forms, moving beyond traditional models of centralized organization.  Networked activism, facilitated by digital technologies, allows for rapid mobilization and cross-border solidarity, as exemplified by the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements.  These movements demonstrate the significance of framing – the strategic articulation of grievances – in shaping public opinion and influencing policy agendas.

However, recent developments also highlight the challenges faced by social movements.  The rise of "post-truth" politics and the proliferation of misinformation complicate efforts to build consensus and mobilize support.  Furthermore,  state repression, including surveillance and legal restrictions, continues to stifle activism in many contexts.  While digital technologies enhance mobilization, they also present vulnerabilities, including data breaches and algorithmic manipulation.  Consequently, understanding the interplay between technological affordances, strategic framing, and counter-mobilization efforts is crucial for comprehending the ongoing evolution and impact of social movements on societal change.  Future research should further explore the intersection of digital technologies and movement efficacy within specific socio-political contexts.
