Globalization's pervasive influence on local cultures is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate. While proponents highlight increased intercultural exchange and access to diverse perspectives, critics emphasize the homogenizing pressures that threaten cultural diversity and unique traditions.  This paper investigates the multifaceted effects of globalization on local cultures, specifically addressing the inherent methodological challenges in empirically measuring cultural change.  Traditional quantitative approaches often struggle to capture the nuanced and subjective nature of cultural shifts, while qualitative methods, while richer in detail, can suffer from issues of generalizability and researcher bias.  Furthermore, disentangling the impact of globalization from other concurrent societal changes—such as technological advancements or internal socio-political dynamics—presents a significant hurdle.  This research acknowledges these limitations and proposes a mixed-methods approach incorporating both quantitative indices of cultural traits (e.g., language usage, traditional practice prevalence) and qualitative data gathered through ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews. This methodology aims to offer a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of globalization’s complex relationship with local cultures, addressing inherent experimental challenges through triangulation and careful contextualization.
