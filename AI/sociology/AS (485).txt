While a purely quantum mechanical explanation of social media's impact on human behavior is currently beyond our capabilities, a theoretical framework can be proposed.  We can posit that the human mind, a complex system with emergent properties, might be analogous to a quantum system exhibiting superposition and entanglement.  Social media feeds, representing a constant influx of information, could be considered an external perturbation affecting this system.  The multitude of choices presented (likes, shares, comments) creates a superposition of potential behavioral states, with the final action representing a "measurement" collapsing the wave function.

Furthermore, the interconnected nature of social networks mirrors entanglement.  An individual's post influences the emotional states and subsequent actions of connected users, thus entangling their behavioral wave functions.  Algorithmic curation, selectively exposing users to specific content, manipulates the probability amplitudes of different behavioral outcomes, potentially biasing the system towards certain actions, such as polarization or conformity.  This suggests that the "observer effect" – the act of observing influencing the observed – plays a crucial role, with the algorithms acting as a selective observer.  Further research employing computational models incorporating quantum principles may be necessary to fully explore this complex interplay.
