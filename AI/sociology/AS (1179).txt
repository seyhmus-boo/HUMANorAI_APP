Economic policies significantly influence social well-being, a multifaceted concept encompassing health, education, and social inclusion.  Historically, a focus on macroeconomic stability, often prioritizing GDP growth, dominated policy agendas. However, recent developments highlight the limitations of this narrow approach.  The growing recognition of inequality, alongside the climate crisis and technological disruption, has shifted the discourse towards more inclusive and sustainable economic strategies.

Recent research emphasizes the importance of distributional effects of economic policies.  For instance, regressive tax systems, while boosting overall GDP, can exacerbate inequality, negatively impacting social well-being through reduced access to healthcare and education for vulnerable populations. Conversely, progressive taxation and social safety nets, while potentially impacting short-term economic growth, can demonstrably improve health outcomes and social cohesion.  Furthermore, policies promoting green technologies and sustainable practices contribute to both environmental sustainability and long-term economic resilience, positively affecting future well-being.  Thus,  contemporary economic policymaking necessitates a holistic approach, integrating social and environmental considerations alongside traditional macroeconomic targets.
