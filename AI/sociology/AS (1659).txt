This abstract explores the relationship between economic policies and social well-being through a novel quantum mechanical framework.  Traditional macroeconomic models often treat societal components as classical, deterministic entities.  We propose a quantum-like approach, modeling individual agents' well-being as a superposition of states representing various levels of satisfaction, influenced by policy-induced potential "fields."  These fields, corresponding to factors like income inequality, access to healthcare, and educational opportunities, modulate the probability amplitudes of each well-being state.  Policy interventions, akin to quantum measurements, collapse these superpositions, impacting the distribution of well-being across the population.  Specifically, we hypothesize that policies aiming to minimize inequality and maximize resource accessibility create a more evenly distributed probability amplitude landscape, leading to a higher expectation value of social well-being.  Furthermore, we suggest that the entanglement of individual well-being states, reflecting interconnectedness within society, plays a crucial role.  A quantitative model utilizing density matrix formalism, incorporating policy parameters as external influences, is proposed for future research to validate this framework and allow for predictive analysis of policy effectiveness on social well-being.  This quantum-inspired approach offers a potentially richer and more nuanced understanding of complex socio-economic dynamics than purely classical models.
