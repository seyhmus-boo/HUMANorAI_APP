Globalization's impact on local cultures remains a complex and hotly debated topic. This presentation examines recent developments highlighting both the homogenizing and diversifying effects of interconnectedness.  While concerns over cultural imperialism, driven by the dominance of global media and consumerism, persist,  we argue that the narrative is far more nuanced.  Recent research demonstrates a rise in "glocalization," where global trends are adapted and reinterpreted within specific local contexts, creating hybrid cultural forms.  This process is facilitated by digital technologies, enabling localized content creation and dissemination, fostering both cultural exchange and resistance.  The presentation will analyze case studies demonstrating the dynamic interplay between global forces and local agency, focusing on the resilience and adaptation of cultural practices in the face of globalization. We will specifically explore the role of social media in preserving and promoting vernacular languages and traditions, alongside its potential to exacerbate cultural anxieties. Finally, we will discuss the implications of these shifting dynamics for cultural preservation strategies and future research directions.
