This paper examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond simplistic correlations to explore nuanced causal pathways.  We posit that the impact of economic policies on social well-being is contingent upon both the specific policy instrument employed and the socio-political context within which it is implemented.  While neoliberal policies focused on market liberalization often prioritize economic growth, evidence suggests their effects on social well-being are heterogeneous, potentially exacerbating inequality and undermining social safety nets in certain contexts.  Conversely, social democratic policies emphasizing redistribution and social investment may yield improved health outcomes, reduced poverty, and greater social cohesion, although they may face challenges related to fiscal sustainability and economic competitiveness.  The paper argues for a more holistic approach, integrating qualitative and quantitative methods to assess the distributional effects of economic policies, accounting for factors such as social capital, access to essential services, and environmental sustainability.  Further research is needed to establish robust causal links between specific policy interventions and diverse dimensions of social well-being, informing the design of more equitable and effective economic strategies.
