Social integration, the process by which individuals become full and active members of a society, is increasingly shaped by the complexities of cultural diversity.  While the benefits of multicultural societies are widely acknowledged – encompassing economic dynamism and enriched cultural landscapes – the impact of cultural diversity on social integration remains a nuanced and actively debated topic.  Recent research has moved beyond simplistic assimilation models, recognizing the importance of intercultural contact and the role of social structures in facilitating or hindering integration.  This paper examines the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, considering recent developments in several key areas.  Firstly, we analyze emerging methodologies for measuring social integration beyond traditional assimilationist frameworks, acknowledging the diverse pathways to belonging. Secondly, we explore the impact of socio-economic inequalities and discriminatory practices on integration outcomes for minority groups, highlighting the persistent challenges faced by marginalized communities.  Finally, we assess the effectiveness of policies aimed at fostering intercultural dialogue and promoting inclusive citizenship, examining their impact on social cohesion in diverse societies. By integrating insights from various disciplines, including sociology, anthropology, and political science, this paper aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of this crucial societal issue.
