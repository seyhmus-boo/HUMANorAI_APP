This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, tracing its evolution from early online forums to the ubiquitous platforms of today.  Early research focused on the potential for enhanced social connection and information dissemination, mirroring utopian visions of a globally interconnected society.  However, the proliferation of social media has yielded more complex outcomes.  We examine the documented influence on self-esteem, body image, and mental health, highlighting the correlation between heavy social media use and increased rates of anxiety and depression, particularly amongst young adults.  Furthermore, the presentation analyzes the impact on political polarization, echo chambers, and the spread of misinformation,  demonstrating how algorithmic curation can reinforce pre-existing biases and hinder critical thinking.  Finally, we consider the implications of social media's pervasive influence on attention spans, interpersonal communication, and the very construction of identity in the digital age. The presentation concludes by suggesting avenues for future research and potential strategies for mitigating negative consequences while harnessing the positive aspects of this powerful technology.
