This research paper explores the complex interplay between mental health and its societal ramifications through a sociological lens, highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary connections necessary for a comprehensive understanding. While the medical model often dominates discussions of mental illness, focusing on biological and psychological factors, a sociological perspective emphasizes the significant influence of social structures, cultural norms, and power dynamics on mental health outcomes and experiences.  This paper argues that a purely biomedical approach is insufficient, necessitating the integration of insights from disciplines such as anthropology, economics, and political science.  Anthropology offers crucial context regarding culturally-specific expressions and understandings of mental distress, while economics illuminates the impact of socioeconomic inequalities on mental health disparities.  Furthermore, political science contributes to our understanding of policy formations and resource allocation within mental healthcare systems. By examining the intersection of these disciplines, this research aims to shed light on the social determinants of mental health, the stigmatization surrounding mental illness, and the efficacy of various social interventions. Ultimately, this interdisciplinary approach is crucial for developing effective strategies to promote mental well-being and reduce the social burden of mental health issues.
