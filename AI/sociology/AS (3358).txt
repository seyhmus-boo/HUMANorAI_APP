Class inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across social strata, presents significant societal challenges that are difficult to experimentally isolate and analyze.  While observational studies readily demonstrate correlations between socioeconomic status and outcomes like health, education, and incarceration, establishing causal links remains problematic.  Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for causal inference, are ethically and practically challenging to implement on a societal scale.  Manipulating factors like income or access to quality education for large populations is infeasible. 

Furthermore, confounding variables – pre-existing differences in individual characteristics and environmental factors – are highly influential and difficult to control.  These confounders interact complexly with class status, obscuring the independent impact of inequality.  Experimental designs attempting to isolate the effect of specific inequality dimensions, such as wealth disparity versus access to healthcare, face similar challenges in defining and manipulating the variables of interest while accounting for their interconnectedness and the inherent longitudinal nature of societal processes. This methodological complexity ultimately hinders a precise understanding of the full causal mechanisms linking class inequality to its widespread societal consequences.
