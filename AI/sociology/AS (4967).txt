This paper explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth is insufficient for achieving broad-based societal improvement.  We posit that a robust framework requires consideration of both macroeconomic and microeconomic policies that directly impact diverse dimensions of well-being, including health, education, and social inclusion.  Expansionary fiscal policies, while potentially stimulating economic growth, may exacerbate inequality if not coupled with targeted social safety nets and progressive taxation.  Similarly, neoliberal structural adjustment programs, although aiming for market efficiency, can negatively impact vulnerable populations through increased unemployment and reduced access to essential services.  Conversely, investments in human capital through education and healthcare, alongside policies promoting fair labor practices and social protection, can significantly contribute to enhanced social well-being, even if short-term economic growth targets are not immediately met.  Ultimately, a balanced approach acknowledging the interplay between economic outcomes and social equity is crucial for achieving sustainable and inclusive development.  Further research should focus on empirically evaluating the long-term societal impacts of various policy interventions, moving beyond simplistic correlations to establish causal relationships.
