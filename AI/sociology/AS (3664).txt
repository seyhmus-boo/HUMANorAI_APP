The pervasive influence of social media on human behavior is a subject of extensive sociological and psychological research.  However, a novel perspective emerges when considering the inherent indeterminacy and interconnectedness inherent in quantum mechanics. This paper proposes a framework for understanding the impact of social media through a quantum-inspired lens, moving beyond classical deterministic models of human action. We argue that the seemingly chaotic and unpredictable nature of online interactions mirrors the probabilistic nature of quantum phenomena.  The constant influx of information, the rapid shifting of attention, and the entangled nature of online relationships can be conceptualized using quantum principles like superposition and entanglement.  Instead of viewing individual users as isolated entities responding predictably to stimuli, we propose a model where users exist in a superposition of states, influenced by a complex interplay of probabilistic interactions within their social media network.  This entanglement manifests in the rapid propagation of information, the formation of echo chambers, and the amplification of specific behavioral patterns.  By applying quantum theoretical concepts, this research aims to offer a more nuanced understanding of the complex and often counterintuitive ways in which social media shapes individual and collective behavior.
