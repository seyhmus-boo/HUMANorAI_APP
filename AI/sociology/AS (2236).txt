Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, profoundly impacts various aspects of human life and social structures. This paper investigates the multifaceted nature of class inequality and its pervasive effects on society, moving beyond a purely economic lens to encompass social, political, and health outcomes.  Existing literature predominantly focuses on the economic disparities associated with class, such as income gaps and wealth accumulation. However, this research adopts a broader perspective, examining how class inequality manifests in unequal access to quality education, healthcare, and political representation. We analyze the perpetuation of intergenerational inequality and the social mechanisms that reinforce class stratification, including discriminatory practices, limited social mobility, and the concentration of power within specific socioeconomic groups.  Furthermore, we explore the societal consequences of this inequality, including increased crime rates, social unrest, and diminished overall societal well-being. Through a critical review of existing literature and a synthesis of empirical evidence, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of class inequality's intricate and far-reaching implications, contributing to a more nuanced discussion of potential solutions and policy interventions.
