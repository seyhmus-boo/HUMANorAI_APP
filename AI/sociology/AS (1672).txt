This presentation examines the persistent and evolving nature of class inequality and its multifaceted societal impacts.  Recent developments, particularly the exacerbation of inequality during the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, highlight the urgent need for renewed scholarly and policy attention. We will explore how these crises have disproportionately affected lower socioeconomic groups, widening existing disparities in health, education, and economic opportunity.  Beyond immediate material impacts, the presentation will analyze the longer-term consequences of inequality, including its contribution to political polarization, social unrest, and decreased social mobility.  Drawing on recent empirical research, we will consider the evolving role of technological advancements, automation, and globalization in shaping class structures and exacerbating inequality.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly discuss innovative policy interventions proposed to mitigate inequality, such as strengthened social safety nets, progressive taxation, and investments in human capital.  Finally, we will consider the limitations of existing approaches and propose avenues for future research aimed at fostering more equitable and just societies.
