Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex interplay of homogenization and hybridization.  While increased interconnectedness facilitates the dissemination of global cultural products and norms, leading to potential cultural erosion through homogenization, local cultures demonstrate remarkable resilience and adaptability.  This paper argues that globalization does not necessarily result in uniform cultural landscapes. Instead, it fosters processes of hybridization, where global and local elements intertwine to create new cultural forms. This hybridization can manifest as the selective adoption of global elements, their adaptation to existing local contexts, or the strategic use of global platforms to promote and revitalize local traditions.  However, the power dynamics inherent in globalization often privilege dominant cultures, creating uneven power relationships that can negatively impact the viability of less powerful cultural expressions. Therefore, understanding globalization's effects necessitates examining the nuanced interactions between global flows and local agency, acknowledging both the risks of cultural homogenization and the potential for creative cultural hybridity.
