Good morning.  Today's lecture explores class inequality through a unique lens: quantum mechanical principles.  While seemingly disparate, the concept of superposition, inherent in quantum mechanics, offers a compelling analogy.  Individuals in a society, much like quantum particles, exist in a superposition of potential outcomes, their future trajectories determined by a complex interplay of societal forces.  However, class inequality introduces a bias, akin to a strong external field, collapsing this superposition prematurely.  The privileged, possessing inherent "wave function collapse" advantages (access to education, resources, etc.), are more likely to materialize in favorable outcomes.  Conversely, the disadvantaged remain in a less-defined state, their potential suppressed by systemic barriers.

This results in a societal wave function characterized by high variance:  a broad distribution of outcomes where a small proportion dominate the higher energy levels (wealth, power), while the majority populate lower, less desirable states.  This uneven distribution contributes to social instability, reducing overall societal "coherence" and increasing the probability of disruptive events, analogous to quantum decoherence. Addressing class inequality, therefore, necessitates manipulating this societal "wave function," mitigating the external field bias to allow for a more equitable superposition and a more stable, coherent societal outcome.
