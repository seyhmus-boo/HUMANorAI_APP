This presentation examines the evolving role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on recent developments and challenges.  Traditional models emphasizing centralized organization and hierarchical leadership are increasingly challenged by the rise of decentralized, networked movements facilitated by digital technologies.  We will explore how these digital platforms, while empowering grassroots activism and global mobilization, also present new complexities concerning information dissemination, counter-movements, and the potential for manipulation and surveillance.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the interplay between online and offline mobilization, considering how digital activism translates into tangible political and social impact.  Recent examples, including the #MeToo movement, Black Lives Matter, and climate activism, will illustrate the diverse strategies employed by contemporary social movements and their varying degrees of success in achieving their goals.  Finally, we will discuss the ongoing debates surrounding movement efficacy, sustainability, and the long-term effects of digital activism on democratic participation and societal transformation. The presentation aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding of the dynamic relationship between social movements and societal change in the digital age.
