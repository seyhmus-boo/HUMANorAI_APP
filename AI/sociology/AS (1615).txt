This paper examines the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms, moving beyond a simplistic transmission model to explore its complex and often contradictory influence. While education is frequently posited as a vehicle for societal progress and norm internalization, its impact is mediated by various factors including curriculum content, pedagogical approaches, social interactions within educational settings, and the broader socio-political context.  We argue that education simultaneously reinforces existing norms, challenges them, and contributes to the creation of new ones.  This study analyzes the interplay between formal and informal learning environments, exploring how educational institutions both transmit dominant cultural values and provide spaces for critical reflection and social change.  Through a review of existing literature and employing a theoretical framework that integrates sociological and pedagogical perspectives, we investigate how different educational systems and levels of schooling impact the adoption, modification, and resistance of social norms. The findings contribute to a nuanced understanding of education's agency in shaping societal values and behaviors, highlighting its potential both to perpetuate inequalities and to foster positive social transformation.
