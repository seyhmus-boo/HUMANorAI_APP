This presentation examines the evolving role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on recent developments and their implications for theoretical understanding.  While traditional models emphasized collective action framing and resource mobilization, contemporary movements demonstrate a shift towards decentralized, networked organizing facilitated by digital technologies.  We will analyze the impact of this "digital activism" on mobilization strategies, including the rapid dissemination of information, the formation of global solidarity networks, and the ability to bypass traditional media gatekeepers.  However, this digital turn also presents challenges, such as the spread of misinformation, the vulnerability to online surveillance, and the potential for echo chambers and polarization.  The presentation will further explore the increasingly fluid boundaries between online and offline activism, showcasing how movements strategically utilize both spaces to achieve their goals.  Finally, it will discuss the implications of these developments for future research on social movements, suggesting a need for interdisciplinary approaches that incorporate digital ethnography and network analysis alongside traditional sociological methodologies to comprehensively understand their impact on societal transformation.
