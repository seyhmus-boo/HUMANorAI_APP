Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, typically analyzed through sociological and economic lenses, offers a compelling avenue for exploration through a novel, albeit unconventional, framework: quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate, the principles of quantum mechanics, specifically those concerning entanglement and superposition, provide potent metaphors for understanding the intricate, interconnected, and often unpredictable nature of class stratification and its societal consequences. This paper argues that viewing class inequality through this lens allows for a more nuanced understanding of the system's emergent properties, transcending traditional linear cause-and-effect models.  We posit that the interwoven states of different socioeconomic classes, analogous to entangled quantum particles, exhibit non-local correlations, meaning the condition of one class significantly influences the others in unforeseen ways.  This entanglement manifests in societal phenomena like wealth disparity, limited social mobility, and systemic discrimination, each acting as a "measurement" that collapses the system's potential states into observable realities.  By applying quantum theoretical concepts, we aim to demonstrate how the seemingly deterministic aspects of class inequality are, in fact, shaped by probabilistic interactions and feedback loops, challenging established paradigms and offering new avenues for intervention and policy design.
