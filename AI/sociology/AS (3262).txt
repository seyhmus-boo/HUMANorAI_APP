This presentation examines the multifaceted nature of class inequality and its pervasive effects on society, drawing on insights from sociology, economics, and political science.  We argue that understanding class inequality requires a move beyond simplistic economic indicators to encompass its social and political dimensions.  Sociological perspectives on social stratification and cultural capital will be integrated with economic analyses of income distribution and wealth concentration to illuminate the mechanisms by which inequality is reproduced across generations.  Specifically, we will explore how unequal access to education, healthcare, and political representation reinforces existing power structures.  Furthermore, the presentation will examine the political consequences of class inequality, including its impact on democratic participation, social cohesion, and the legitimacy of governing institutions.  By adopting an interdisciplinary lens, we aim to demonstrate how class inequality manifests not merely as an economic problem, but as a systemic issue with far-reaching social and political repercussions, requiring a similarly multifaceted approach to mitigation and reform.  The presentation will conclude by briefly discussing potential avenues for future research focusing on the intersectionality of class with other social categories such as race and gender.
