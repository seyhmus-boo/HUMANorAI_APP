This presentation examines the persistent and evolving nature of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on contemporary society.  Recent scholarship highlights a complex interplay of factors beyond traditional economic indicators, including access to quality education, healthcare, and social mobility.  While income inequality remains a significant concern, we will explore emerging research emphasizing the role of intergenerational wealth transmission, the increasing concentration of capital, and the erosion of social safety nets in exacerbating existing inequalities.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the societal consequences of this widening gap, focusing on its contribution to declining social cohesion, increased political polarization, and poorer health outcomes across various demographic groups.  We will consider the impact of automation and technological advancements on labour markets and their disproportionate effect on lower-income populations.  Finally, we will briefly survey recent policy interventions designed to mitigate class inequality and discuss their effectiveness and limitations, prompting further discussion on potential future strategies for addressing this persistent societal challenge.
