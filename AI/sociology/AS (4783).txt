This presentation explores the pivotal role of education in shaping societal norms, arguing that it functions not merely as a transmitter of knowledge, but as a powerful societal sculptor.  We posit that education acts like a potter's wheel, molding individual attitudes and behaviors into socially acceptable forms.  The curriculum, akin to the potter's clay, provides the raw material –  facts, values, and perspectives – upon which the educational process operates.  Teachers, acting as skilled artisans, guide this process, shaping the "clay" through pedagogical techniques, fostering critical thinking, and promoting ethical reasoning.  

However, this analogy highlights inherent limitations.  A flawed potter's wheel (e.g., inequitable access to quality education) produces uneven results, perpetuating social inequalities.  Similarly, biased curricula, acting as contaminated clay, can mold individuals into upholding harmful norms.  We will analyze how educational systems, influenced by prevailing power structures, can either reinforce existing norms or challenge them, leading to social progress or stagnation.  Ultimately, we argue for a critical examination of educational practices, advocating for inclusive and equitable systems that foster critical consciousness and equip individuals to actively shape, rather than passively inherit, societal norms.  The presentation concludes by considering the implications for educational reform towards more just and equitable societies.
