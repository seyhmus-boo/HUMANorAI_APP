This presentation examines the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted societal effects, drawing upon insights from sociology, economics, and political science.  We argue that a purely disciplinary approach is insufficient to grasp the complex interplay of factors contributing to and resulting from class stratification.  Sociological perspectives, focusing on social mobility, cultural capital, and the reproduction of inequality through institutions, are crucial.  However, these insights are incomplete without integrating economic analyses of income distribution, wealth concentration, and the impact of neoliberal policies.  Furthermore, political science illuminates how class inequality shapes political participation, representation, and policy outcomes, often reinforcing existing power structures.

The presentation will explore the interdisciplinary connections between these fields, demonstrating how economic disparities translate into social exclusion and political marginalization.  Specific examples will illustrate how unequal access to education, healthcare, and justice systems perpetuate the cycle of inequality.  We will conclude by discussing the implications of this interconnectedness for developing effective strategies to mitigate class inequality and foster a more equitable society. This interdisciplinary lens allows for a more nuanced and holistic understanding of this critical societal challenge, offering pathways for future research and policy interventions.
