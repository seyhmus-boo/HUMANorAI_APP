The conventional understanding of the relationship between economic policies and social well-being primarily relies on classical and neoclassical economic models, often neglecting the inherent complexities and uncertainties of human behavior. This paper proposes a novel framework, drawing upon the principles of quantum mechanics, to analyze this relationship.  Instead of deterministic outcomes, we posit that social well-being, conceptualized as a multifaceted superposition of individual experiences and societal outcomes, is influenced by economic policies in a probabilistic manner.  We argue that the inherent uncertainties and interconnectedness within socio-economic systems warrant a departure from classical models, embracing the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics to better capture the emergent properties of social well-being. This research will explore the application of quantum-inspired concepts such as superposition, entanglement, and wave-particle duality to model the impact of specific economic policies – such as taxation, welfare programs, and investment strategies – on indicators of well-being like health, education, and social cohesion. By adopting this novel approach, we aim to shed light on the unpredictable and often counterintuitive outcomes of economic interventions, offering a more nuanced and potentially more effective understanding of the complex interplay between economic policy design and societal outcomes.
