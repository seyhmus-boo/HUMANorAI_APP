Education plays a pivotal role in shaping societal norms, acting as a powerful engine of social change.  Think of norms as the unwritten rules governing social interaction; education provides the blueprint for understanding and modifying these rules.  Like a sculptor chiseling away at a block of marble, education refines raw societal tendencies.  It introduces concepts of equality, justice, and tolerance, chipping away at ingrained prejudices and biases â€“ a process akin to refining crude ore into valuable metal.  

Furthermore, education acts as a societal lubricant, reducing friction between different groups. Through exposure to diverse perspectives and critical thinking skills, individuals develop empathy and understanding, mitigating potential conflicts that stem from differing norms.  It's similar to a well-oiled machine, where education reduces the resistance between disparate parts, allowing for smoother societal functioning.  Ultimately, education empowers individuals to not simply conform to existing norms but to critically evaluate and, where necessary, actively reshape them, fostering a more equitable and just society.
