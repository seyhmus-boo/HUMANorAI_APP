The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, demanding an interdisciplinary approach encompassing economics, sociology, political science, and public health.  While neoclassical economics often prioritizes GDP growth as the primary indicator of well-being, a broader perspective acknowledges its limitations.  Social well-being encompasses a wider array of factors, including health outcomes, education levels, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability.  Distributional effects of economic policies are crucial; policies prioritizing trickle-down economics may stimulate growth but exacerbate inequality, negatively impacting social well-being. Conversely, social safety nets, while potentially impacting short-term economic growth, can mitigate poverty and improve overall societal health and stability, aligning with capabilities and human development approaches.  Political science sheds light on the influence of power dynamics and lobbying on policy choices, often favouring certain groups at the expense of others.  Furthermore, public health research demonstrates the strong correlation between socioeconomic status and health outcomes, highlighting the societal costs of economic inequality.  An effective approach requires integrating insights from these disciplines to design holistic policies that foster both economic prosperity and genuine social progress, acknowledging the interconnectedness of economic and social spheres.
