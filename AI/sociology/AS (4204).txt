Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies since the Neolithic Revolution, refers to the unequal distribution of resources, power, and opportunities based on socioeconomic status.  Historically, this manifested in feudal systems with rigid hierarchies and later, in capitalist societies, through disparities in wealth, income, and access to education and healthcare.  While industrialization initially promised upward mobility, it also exacerbated existing inequalities, leading to the emergence of a distinct working class and a concentration of wealth among the elite.

The consequences of persistent class inequality are multifaceted and profoundly impact societal stability.  High levels of inequality correlate with increased crime rates, poorer health outcomes across the lower strata, and diminished social mobility.  Furthermore, it fuels political polarization, erodes social cohesion, and undermines democratic institutions by concentrating power in the hands of a privileged few.  Addressing this complex issue requires comprehensive strategies encompassing progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and investments in education and equitable opportunities to promote a more just and inclusive society.
