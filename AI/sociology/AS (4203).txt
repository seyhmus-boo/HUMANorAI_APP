Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the pervasive issue of class inequality and its societal ramifications, specifically focusing on the inherent challenges in experimental investigation.  While observational studies readily demonstrate correlations between socioeconomic status and various outcomes – health, education, incarceration rates – establishing causal links proves exceptionally difficult.  Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard in causal inference, are ethically problematic and often practically infeasible when manipulating socioeconomic factors.  

Consider attempting to randomly assign individuals to different income brackets. The logistical and ethical complexities are insurmountable. Furthermore, the multifaceted nature of class – encompassing wealth, education, occupation, and social capital – complicates isolating specific causal pathways.  Confounding variables are rampant, obscuring the true effects of class inequality.  Therefore, researchers rely heavily on quasi-experimental designs and sophisticated statistical techniques, acknowledging the inherent limitations and potential for bias in drawing definitive causal conclusions about the societal impact of this complex phenomenon.
