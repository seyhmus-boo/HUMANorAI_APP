The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, demanding an interdisciplinary approach.  While traditional economics focuses on aggregate measures like GDP, a holistic understanding requires integrating perspectives from sociology, psychology, and political science.  For instance, neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and free markets, while potentially boosting economic growth, may exacerbate social inequality, leading to decreased social cohesion as explored by sociological studies on wealth distribution.  Furthermore, psychological research highlights the impact of economic insecurity on mental health and well-being, demonstrating a direct link between economic policies and individual psychological outcomes.  Political science adds another layer by examining how policy choices reflect power dynamics and influence access to resources, thereby impacting social justice and equity.  Therefore, effective policymaking necessitates moving beyond purely economic indicators and incorporating a broader understanding of the social, psychological, and political consequences of economic decisions to achieve genuine social well-being.
