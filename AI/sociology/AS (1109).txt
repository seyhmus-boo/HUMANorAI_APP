The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has long been a central theme in social science research.  While traditional economic models often prioritize GDP growth as the primary indicator of success, a growing body of literature emphasizes the multifaceted nature of well-being, incorporating factors such as health, education, environmental sustainability, and social equity.  Recent developments in the field have moved beyond simple correlations, employing increasingly sophisticated econometric techniques and incorporating diverse datasets to better understand the nuanced pathways through which economic policies impact social outcomes.  This paper examines this dynamic interplay, focusing particularly on the implications of recent policy shifts.  Specifically, we analyze the contrasting effects of austerity measures versus expansionary fiscal policies on various dimensions of well-being, considering both short-term and long-term consequences.  Furthermore, we investigate the role of inclusive growth strategies, focusing on policies designed to address income inequality and promote social mobility, and their impact on broader societal well-being.  The analysis will draw upon recent empirical studies and theoretical frameworks to provide a comprehensive assessment of this crucial relationship in the context of contemporary global challenges.
