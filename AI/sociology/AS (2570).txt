Education plays a crucial role in shaping and perpetuating social norms, acting as both a transmitter and a transformer of societal values.  This paper explores the multifaceted nature of this influence, arguing that formal education transmits existing norms through curricula, pedagogy, and the hidden curriculum, reinforcing dominant societal structures and power dynamics.  The socialisation process within educational institutions, including peer interactions and teacher-student relationships, further solidifies these norms. However, education also possesses a transformative potential.  Critical pedagogy and inclusive curricula can challenge established norms by fostering critical thinking, promoting social justice, and encouraging dialogue surrounding alternative perspectives.  The effectiveness of education in shaping social norms depends on the interplay between the intended curriculum, the lived experiences of students, and the broader socio-political context.  Future research should investigate the differential impact of educational interventions on diverse populations and explore strategies for leveraging education to promote positive social change and equitable norms.
