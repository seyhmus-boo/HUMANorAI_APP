Education's role in shaping social norms is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon with deep historical roots.  Historically, formal education systems, particularly those established by nation-states, have actively promoted assimilation and the inculcation of dominant cultural values.  From the Prussian model's emphasis on obedience and national unity to the post-colonial imposition of Western curricula, education served as a powerful tool for social engineering, reinforcing existing power structures and norms.  However, this narrative is increasingly challenged by critical pedagogy, which highlights education's capacity for social critique and transformation.

Contemporary scholarship emphasizes the interplay between the formal curriculum, hidden curriculum (unwritten norms and values), and the broader socio-cultural context in shaping individual beliefs and behaviours.  Education transmits not only explicit knowledge but also implicit social norms related to gender, race, class, and other social categories, often perpetuating inequalities.  Conversely, education can also serve as a catalyst for social change. By fostering critical thinking, promoting intercultural understanding, and empowering marginalized groups, educational institutions can challenge and reshape existing social norms, promoting inclusivity and social justice.  The effectiveness of this transformative potential depends on a conscious and deliberate effort to deconstruct ingrained biases and create equitable learning environments.
