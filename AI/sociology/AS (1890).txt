Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have profoundly shaped societal change throughout history.  From the abolitionist movement dismantling slavery to the suffrage movement securing women's voting rights, their impact is undeniable.  Early scholarship focused on characterizing movement structures and resource mobilization, emphasizing factors like leadership, organizational capacity, and access to resources.  However, contemporary approaches, such as framing theory and political process theory, offer more nuanced understandings.  Framing theory highlights the crucial role of narrative construction in mobilizing support, emphasizing how movements frame issues to resonate with broader societal values.  Political process theory emphasizes the interplay between movement mobilization and the political opportunity structure, suggesting that successful movements leverage existing political cleavages and institutional vulnerabilities.

Furthermore, the impact of social movements extends beyond immediate policy changes.  They often reshape cultural norms and values, fostering greater awareness and altering public discourse.  The Civil Rights Movement, for instance, not only achieved legislative victories but also significantly altered racial attitudes and societal perceptions of equality. While not always successful in achieving all their goals, social movements remain a vital mechanism for challenging established power structures and driving transformative societal change, constantly adapting their strategies and tactics in response to evolving political contexts.
