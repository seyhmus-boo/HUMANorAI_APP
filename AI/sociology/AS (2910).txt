Social media's pervasive influence on human behavior is a subject of growing scholarly concern. This lecture explores the multifaceted impact of these platforms, focusing on three key areas. Firstly, the curated nature of online profiles fosters social comparison, potentially leading to increased feelings of inadequacy and anxiety, particularly amongst young adults.  Secondly, the algorithmic design of social media feeds contributes to filter bubbles and echo chambers, limiting exposure to diverse perspectives and reinforcing pre-existing biases, potentially impacting political polarization and societal cohesion. Finally, the constant connectivity facilitated by these platforms can lead to addiction-like behaviors, impacting sleep patterns, attention spans, and overall mental well-being.  Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term consequences of these behavioral shifts, especially considering the evolving nature of social media technologies and their continuous integration into daily life.  Addressing these challenges requires a multidisciplinary approach encompassing psychological, sociological, and technological perspectives.
