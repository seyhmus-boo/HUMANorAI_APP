This presentation explores the impact of globalization on local cultures through the lens of quantum mechanics, moving beyond classical deterministic models.  We propose that cultural interaction under globalization can be viewed as a complex superposition of states, where traditional cultural norms coexist with globally-influenced adaptations. This superposition is not a simple mixture, but rather an entangled state, reflecting the interconnectedness and mutual influence of global and local elements.  The collapse of this superposition – a shift towards either dominant global norms or the reinforcement of local identity – is not predetermined, but rather influenced by various factors acting as "measurement operators." These include technological penetration, economic integration, migration patterns, and government policies.  The strength of entanglement between global and local influences determines the resilience of local cultures;  stronger entanglement suggests a greater capacity for adaptation and hybridity, while weaker entanglement may lead to cultural homogenization or fragmentation.  This quantum-inspired framework offers a novel approach to understanding the non-linear and often unpredictable dynamics inherent in globalization's effects on cultural diversity, suggesting that preservation of cultural uniqueness requires strategic interventions to actively support the superposition state.  We will discuss implications for cultural policy and preservation strategies based on this theoretical framework.
