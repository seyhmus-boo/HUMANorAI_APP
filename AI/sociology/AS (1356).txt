Good morning. Today's lecture will examine class inequality and its societal ramifications, focusing on recent trends.  While class stratification has historically existed, contemporary developments demonstrate a concerning exacerbation.  Rising income inequality, fuelled by globalization and technological advancements, has led to a widening gap between the wealthy elite and the working class, particularly impacting access to quality education, healthcare, and housing.

Recent studies highlight a correlation between increased inequality and diminished social mobility, hindering the ability of individuals to improve their socioeconomic standing. This contributes to a fractured society, characterized by growing social unrest and political polarization.  Furthermore, the concentration of wealth at the top limits investment in public goods and exacerbates social problems such as crime and poor health outcomes.  Addressing this requires multifaceted approaches, including progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and investments in education and skills training to promote greater equity and opportunity.  The consequences of inaction are profound and threaten social cohesion.
