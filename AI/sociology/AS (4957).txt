Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies since the emergence of stratified social structures, refers to the unequal distribution of resources, power, and opportunities based on social class.  Historically, feudal systems starkly exemplified this, with rigid hierarchies determining access to land and privilege.  The Industrial Revolution, while generating unprecedented wealth, exacerbated inequality, creating a chasm between the burgeoning capitalist class and the exploited working class.  This disparity fueled social unrest and movements advocating for greater equity, as witnessed in various socialist and communist ideologies.

Today, class inequality manifests in disparities in education, healthcare, housing, and political influence.  Its societal effects are profound.  High levels of inequality correlate with reduced social mobility, hindering individual aspirations and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  Furthermore, it contributes to social instability, manifesting as increased crime rates, political polarization, and a decline in social cohesion.  The concentration of power within a small elite can lead to policies that further disadvantage marginalized groups, creating a self-perpetuating system of unequal distribution and reinforcing societal divisions.  Addressing class inequality requires multifaceted approaches targeting economic policies, education reform, and social safety nets.
