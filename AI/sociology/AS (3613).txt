While a direct application of quantum mechanics to societal structures like class inequality is inherently metaphorical, a conceptual analogy can be drawn.  Consider social strata as analogous to quantized energy levels within an atom.  Individuals occupy specific "levels" determined by socioeconomic factors, akin to electron orbitals.  The energy difference between these levels represents class inequality – a significant energy gap hinders upward mobility, mirroring the energy required for an electron to jump to a higher orbital.

Large energy gaps (substantial inequality) lead to societal instability, analogous to an atom in a highly excited state prone to decay.  This instability manifests as social unrest, crime, and political polarization.  The system strives for a lower energy state, a more equitable distribution, but transitions are not continuous.  They occur through discrete "events" – social movements, policy changes – that alter the overall energy landscape.  The probability of such transitions depends on the energy difference and the presence of external "perturbations," like economic crises or technological advancements.  Ignoring these energy gaps risks a system perpetually teetering on the brink of instability, a socially unsustainable state mirroring an unstable atomic nucleus.  A more equitable distribution, reducing the energy gap between levels, enhances societal stability and overall well-being.
