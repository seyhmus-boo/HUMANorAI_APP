The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being constitutes a central theme in contemporary socio-economic research.  While economic growth is often posited as a primary driver of societal progress, the extent to which specific economic policies translate into improved social well-being remains a subject of ongoing debate. This paper examines the multifaceted connections between diverse economic policy instruments – encompassing fiscal, monetary, and social policies – and key indicators of social well-being, such as health, education, income inequality, and social cohesion.  We argue that a simplistic focus on GDP growth overlooks crucial mediating factors that determine the distribution of economic benefits and their impact on citizens' lives.

This study contributes to the existing literature by employing a comparative analysis of selected developed and developing economies, exploring how different policy approaches yield varying outcomes in social well-being.  Our findings hold practical applications for policymakers seeking to design more effective and equitable strategies.  Understanding the complex interplay between economic policies and social outcomes enables the development of targeted interventions that not only promote economic growth but also ensure its benefits are broadly shared, contributing to a more just and flourishing society.  Ultimately, this research seeks to inform evidence-based policymaking that prioritizes both economic prosperity and social justice.
