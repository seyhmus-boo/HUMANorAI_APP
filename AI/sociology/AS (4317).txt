Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, continues to evolve, demanding renewed scholarly attention. This presentation examines recent developments in understanding its multifaceted effects on society.  We move beyond traditional analyses of income disparities, incorporating nuanced perspectives on wealth concentration, intergenerational mobility, and the impact of technological advancements on labour markets.  Recent research highlights a widening gap between the wealthiest and the poorest, not solely in terms of financial resources, but also in access to quality education, healthcare, and social networks â€“ creating a feedback loop perpetuating inequality across generations.

Furthermore, the presentation explores the burgeoning literature on the societal consequences of this widening gap.  We will examine the links between class inequality and declining social cohesion, increased political polarization, and rising rates of mental health issues.  The erosion of trust in institutions and the rise of populist movements are also considered as potential outcomes of exacerbated class divisions. Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss emerging policy interventions and their efficacy in mitigating the negative societal effects of class inequality, highlighting the need for multi-faceted strategies that address both the root causes and the consequences of this persistent social problem.
