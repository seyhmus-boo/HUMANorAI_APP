Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have historically served as potent catalysts for societal transformation.  This paper examines the multifaceted role of social movements in shaping societal change, focusing on recent developments that challenge established theoretical frameworks.  While classic theories emphasized resource mobilization and political opportunity structures as primary determinants of movement success, contemporary scholarship increasingly highlights the significance of digital technologies, transnational networks, and the evolving nature of collective identity formation.  The proliferation of online activism and the rise of globalized social justice movements necessitate a reassessment of established models.  This research explores the complexities of these new dynamics, examining how digital platforms facilitate mobilization, communication, and transnational solidarity, yet simultaneously present challenges regarding authenticity, reach, and the potential for co-optation.  Furthermore, it investigates the impact of diverse forms of collective action, from large-scale protests to micro-level activism, on policy outcomes and broader societal shifts, ultimately arguing for a nuanced understanding that accounts for both the successes and limitations of social movements in contemporary society.
