Social movements, defined as collective actions aimed at challenging existing power structures and promoting societal change, play a crucial role in shaping societal norms and institutions. This paper explores the mechanisms through which social movements effect change, highlighting their efficacy in mobilizing collective action, framing issues for public discourse, and exerting pressure on political elites.  Successful movements leverage resource mobilization, including material resources, organizational capacity, and symbolic resources, to build momentum and achieve their goals.  Framing strategies, which construct narratives that resonate with public values and mobilize support, are critical in shaping public opinion and influencing policy agendas.  Moreover, movements employ diverse tactics, ranging from peaceful protests and civil disobedience to more disruptive actions, to exert pressure on authorities and create a sense of urgency for change.  Ultimately, the impact of social movements on societal transformation is contingent upon a complex interplay of factors including the movement's internal organization, the broader political context, and the prevailing social and cultural climate.  Further research should explore the long-term consequences of movement activity and the interplay between movement strategies and institutional responses.
