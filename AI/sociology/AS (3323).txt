Social movements, collective actions aimed at challenging or maintaining social structures, are pivotal agents of societal change. Their efficacy stems from their ability to mobilize resources and influence across multiple societal spheres, highlighting the inherently interdisciplinary nature of their study.  Sociology provides frameworks for understanding mobilization dynamics, resource mobilization theory explaining how movements acquire and utilize resources, while political science analyzes their interaction with state power and institutional structures.  

Anthropology contributes by examining the cultural frames and narratives employed by movements to construct identities and garner support, illustrating how shared values and beliefs drive collective action.  Psychology explores the individual motivations and cognitive processes involved in participation, analyzing factors such as social identity and group polarization.  Economics, meanwhile, considers the economic impacts of movements, both on their internal organization and broader societal production and distribution.  This interdisciplinary approach is crucial for a complete understanding of social movements' complex relationship with societal change, encompassing both their success and failures in achieving their objectives.
