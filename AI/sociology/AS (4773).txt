This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of rapid urbanization on community life, focusing on recent developments in social cohesion, civic engagement, and access to resources.  While urbanization offers economic opportunities and improved infrastructure, its effects on community structures are complex and often detrimental.  Recent research highlights a growing disconnect between residents, particularly in sprawling megacities, leading to decreased social capital and weakened community bonds.  This erosion is exacerbated by factors such as increased social inequality, gentrification, and the prevalence of transient populations.  Furthermore, the spatial organization of urban environments, often prioritizing efficiency over social interaction, limits opportunities for spontaneous community building.  However, counter-narratives are emerging, emphasizing the role of digitally mediated social interaction and the resurgence of community-led initiatives focused on local food systems, environmental sustainability, and social justice.  The presentation will analyze these contrasting trends, examining how technological advancements and policy interventions are shaping community life in the context of ongoing urbanization, and will conclude by suggesting avenues for fostering stronger, more inclusive urban communities.
