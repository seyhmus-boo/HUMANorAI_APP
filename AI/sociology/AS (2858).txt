This presentation examines the evolving relationship between economic policies and social well-being, focusing on recent developments that challenge traditional assumptions.  While neoliberal policies emphasizing market liberalization and deregulation have long been championed for their purported growth benefits, recent evidence suggests a more nuanced picture.  Rising inequality, stagnant wages for a significant portion of the population, and increasing social fragmentation in many developed nations cast doubt on the extent to which economic growth translates into widespread social well-being.  

This presentation will analyze recent research highlighting the limitations of solely focusing on GDP growth as a measure of societal progress. We will explore alternative metrics, such as the Human Development Index and measures of subjective well-being, which offer a broader perspective on societal flourishing.  Furthermore, we will discuss the growing emphasis on policies aimed at addressing social determinants of health, such as income inequality, access to quality education, and affordable healthcare, demonstrating a shift towards a more holistic understanding of economic development. The presentation concludes by examining the implications of these shifts for future policy design, advocating for a more integrated approach that prioritizes equitable growth and social justice alongside economic efficiency.
