Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies throughout history, manifests as a hierarchical distribution of resources, power, and opportunities.  From ancient agrarian societies characterized by stark divisions between landowners and laborers to the stratified industrial and post-industrial economies of the modern era, unequal access to wealth has consistently shaped social structures and dynamics.  Historically, systems of feudalism and chattel slavery exemplify extreme forms of class inequality, where inherited status determined access to land, resources, and even personal freedom. The Industrial Revolution, while fostering unprecedented economic growth, exacerbated class divisions, creating a burgeoning proletariat reliant on factory owners for employment and subject to exploitative labor practices.  The resulting social unrest fueled movements for social reform and the development of welfare states aimed at mitigating, albeit imperfectly, the effects of class inequality.  Today, class inequality manifests in disparities in education, healthcare, housing, and political influence, perpetuating cycles of poverty and disadvantage. This inequality undermines social cohesion, fosters resentment and social instability, and limits overall societal progress by hindering the potential contributions of marginalized groups.  Understanding the historical trajectory of class inequality is crucial for effectively addressing its contemporary manifestations and working towards a more equitable future.
