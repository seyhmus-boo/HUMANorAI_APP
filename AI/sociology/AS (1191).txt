This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, drawing upon interdisciplinary perspectives from anthropology, sociology, and economics. While globalization fosters interconnectedness and cultural exchange, its effects on local traditions are complex and often contested.  We will examine the tension between homogenization, characterized by the spread of global brands and cultural norms, and hybridization, where local cultures adapt and integrate global influences, creating unique syncretic forms.  The economic dimensions will be considered, exploring how global markets incentivize cultural commodification and the potential displacement of traditional livelihoods.  Anthropological lenses will illuminate how globalization affects community structures, identity formation, and the transmission of cultural knowledge across generations.  Sociological analysis will further examine the role of power dynamics and resistance movements in shaping the reception and adaptation of global influences.  By integrating these perspectives, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the ongoing interplay between globalization and local cultural persistence, demonstrating both the challenges and opportunities presented by this increasingly interconnected world.
