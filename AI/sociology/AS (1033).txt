This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, drawing upon insights from psychology, sociology, and communication studies.  While offering unprecedented opportunities for connection and information dissemination, social media platforms also present significant challenges.  We examine the psychological effects, including the development of online identity, the influence of social comparison on self-esteem, and the potential for addiction and mental health issues such as anxiety and depression.  Sociologically, we analyze the impact of social media on social capital, the formation of online communities, and the spread of misinformation and polarization.  From a communication perspective, we discuss the evolving nature of language, the dynamics of online discourse, and the role of algorithms in shaping information consumption.  By integrating these interdisciplinary perspectives, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex and often contradictory ways social media shapes individual and collective behavior, highlighting both the benefits and detrimental consequences for society.  The presentation concludes by suggesting avenues for future research and potential strategies for mitigating negative impacts.
