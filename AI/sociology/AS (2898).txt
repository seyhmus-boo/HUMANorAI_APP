Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the experimental challenges inherent in studying class inequality and its societal effects.  While the existence of class inequality is readily observable, rigorously demonstrating its causal impact presents significant methodological hurdles.  Firstly, establishing causality requires controlling for confounding variables â€“ individual agency, inherited traits, and access to resources are all intertwined with class, making isolation of class effects extremely difficult.  Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard in causal inference, are largely infeasible due to the ethical and practical difficulties of randomly assigning individuals to different socioeconomic strata.

Consequently, researchers rely on observational studies, vulnerable to selection bias and endogeneity.  For instance, correlating class with health outcomes might reflect not only the direct impact of class but also the influence of pre-existing health conditions or individual choices.  Furthermore, longitudinal studies, while mitigating some of these issues, face challenges regarding data collection over extended periods, subject attrition, and the ever-evolving nature of class dynamics.  Overcoming these challenges requires innovative methodological approaches, including advanced statistical techniques and the development of more nuanced measures of class, to better understand this complex societal phenomenon.
