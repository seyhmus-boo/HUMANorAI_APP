The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being remains a central concern in contemporary political economy.  While traditional macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth have long served as proxies for societal progress, recent scholarship increasingly emphasizes a more nuanced understanding of this connection, acknowledging the distributional effects of economic policies and their impact on diverse aspects of well-being. This paper explores this complex interplay, focusing on recent developments that challenge conventional wisdom.  Specifically, we examine the limitations of solely relying on GDP growth as a measure of social progress, considering instead multidimensional indicators incorporating health, education, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion.  Recent policy debates surrounding universal basic income, wealth taxes, and green economic initiatives highlight a growing recognition that equitable distribution of resources and sustainable environmental practices are crucial components of genuine social well-being.  Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically exposed the fragility of social safety nets and the disproportionate impact of economic shocks on vulnerable populations, underscoring the urgent need for re-evaluating existing economic policies and their social consequences.  This analysis will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of how economic strategies can be designed to effectively promote not just economic growth, but also a more just and sustainable society.
