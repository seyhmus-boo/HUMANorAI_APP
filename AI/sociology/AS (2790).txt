Social movements, collective actions aimed at achieving social or political change, have undergone significant evolution in recent decades.  While traditional models emphasized centralized leadership and clear organizational structures, contemporary movements increasingly demonstrate decentralized, networked characteristics, facilitated by digital technologies.  Online platforms enable rapid mobilization, information dissemination, and cross-border solidarity, exemplified by the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements.  These digital affordances, however, also present challenges, including issues of misinformation, echo chambers, and the potential for surveillance and repression.  Recent research highlights the complex interplay between online and offline mobilization, demonstrating that digital tools are not solely responsible for success but rather amplify existing social networks and grievances.  Furthermore, scholars are increasingly exploring the role of emotions, framing, and identity construction in shaping movement efficacy and longevity.  Analyzing the diverse strategies employed – from disruptive protests to legal challenges and advocacy – reveals the nuanced relationship between social movement dynamics and consequential societal transformations, including shifts in policy, law, and cultural norms.  Future research should focus on understanding the long-term impacts of digitalization on movement sustainability and the effectiveness of diverse mobilization tactics across different socio-political contexts.
