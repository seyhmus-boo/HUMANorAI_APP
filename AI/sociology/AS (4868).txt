Globalization's impact on local cultures remains a complex and hotly debated topic. This presentation examines recent developments in this ongoing process, moving beyond simplistic narratives of homogenization or resistance. We analyze the nuanced interplay between global flows of information, capital, and people, and their effects on cultural practices, identities, and expressions.  Recent research highlights the emergence of "glocalization," where global trends are adapted and reinterpreted within specific local contexts, generating hybrid cultural forms. This presentation will explore case studies illustrating this dynamic, focusing on the appropriation and re-signification of global cultural products, the resilience of traditional practices in the face of global pressures, and the rise of transnational cultural movements.  Furthermore, we will address the role of digital technologies in both accelerating cultural exchange and fostering localized forms of cultural production and dissemination.  Finally, we will consider the ethical implications of these developments, particularly regarding cultural appropriation, commodification, and the potential loss of linguistic and cultural diversity.  The presentation concludes by arguing for a more nuanced understanding of globalization's impact, acknowledging its multifaceted and often contradictory effects on local cultures.
