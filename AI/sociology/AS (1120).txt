This presentation explores the crucial intersection of sociology and mental health, examining how social structures and processes shape mental well-being and its societal consequences.  We argue that understanding mental health requires moving beyond individualistic explanations and instead focusing on the social determinants of mental illness.  The presentation will analyze the impact of socioeconomic inequality, social exclusion, discrimination (including stigma), and traumatic social events on mental health outcomes, drawing upon relevant sociological theories such as symbolic interactionism, social stress theory, and the concept of social capital.  Further, we will examine how societal responses to mental illness, including the provision of mental healthcare services and the construction of mental health policy, are influenced by social factors, impacting access, quality of care, and ultimately, individuals' lives.  The presentation will conclude by discussing the broader social implications of mental health disparities, highlighting the need for socially just and equitable interventions that address the root causes of mental ill-health and promote mental well-being within a broader framework of social justice.  Empirical examples from recent research will be used to illustrate key concepts throughout.
