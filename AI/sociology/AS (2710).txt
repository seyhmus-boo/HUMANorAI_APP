This presentation examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, tracing its evolution through historical contexts.  Historically, laissez-faire economics, dominant from the 18th century onwards, prioritized economic growth often at the expense of social equity, resulting in significant disparities in wealth and well-being.  The Great Depression exposed the inherent instability of this approach, paving the way for Keynesian interventions aimed at stabilizing the economy and mitigating social hardship through government spending and social safety nets.

However, the latter half of the 20th century witnessed the rise of neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and privatization.  While proponents argued these fostered economic efficiency, critics pointed to increased inequality and a decline in social provisions in many countries.  The 2008 financial crisis further highlighted the limitations of an unfettered market approach, prompting renewed debate on the optimal balance between economic growth and social well-being.

This presentation will analyze these historical shifts, exploring the impact of different policy paradigms on key indicators of social well-being, such as health, education, and income inequality.  It will argue that a nuanced understanding of this complex interplay is crucial for formulating effective policies that promote both economic prosperity and social justice in the 21st century.  The discussion will conclude by considering contemporary challenges and potential future directions for policy-making.
