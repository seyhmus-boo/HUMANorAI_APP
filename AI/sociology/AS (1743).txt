The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, extending beyond simple correlations between GDP growth and subjective happiness. Recent scholarship emphasizes the limitations of solely focusing on macroeconomic indicators.  While economic growth remains crucial for resource allocation and poverty reduction, its impact on well-being is mediated by factors like income inequality, access to quality healthcare and education, and environmental sustainability.  

Recent developments highlight a growing emphasis on inclusive growth strategies. This entails policies that actively address wealth disparities, promoting equitable access to opportunities and resources.  For example, initiatives focusing on universal basic income or strengthening social safety nets are gaining traction, alongside policy debates around wealth taxation and progressive taxation systems aimed at reducing inequality's detrimental impact on social cohesion and mental health.  Furthermore, the burgeoning field of behavioral economics underscores the importance of incorporating psychological and social factors into policy design, recognising that individual well-being is influenced by factors beyond material wealth.  Ultimately, achieving sustainable social well-being requires a holistic policy approach that considers both economic growth and its equitable distribution, alongside investments in social infrastructure and environmental protection.
