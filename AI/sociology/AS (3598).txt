Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and perpetuating social norms, acting as both a transmitter and a potential transformer of societal values.  This paper explores the theoretical mechanisms through which educational institutions influence norm formation and acceptance.  Firstly, the formal curriculum, encompassing explicit instruction and assessments, directly imparts societal values and expectations, fostering conformity to established norms. Secondly, the hidden curriculum, comprising implicit learning through school culture and social interactions, reinforces existing power dynamics and social hierarchies, thereby implicitly shaping acceptable behaviors.  Furthermore, education facilitates social interaction and the development of social capital, exposing individuals to diverse perspectives and potentially challenging existing norms.  However, the extent to which education fosters norm conformity or challenges them is contingent upon factors such as the socio-cultural context, the curriculum's content, and the pedagogical approaches employed.  Ultimately, while education can reinforce existing social structures, it also possesses the potential to promote critical thinking and social change, thereby facilitating the evolution of social norms.
