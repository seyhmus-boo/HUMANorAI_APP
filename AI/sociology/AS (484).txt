This presentation examines the evolving role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on recent theoretical and empirical developments.  Traditional models emphasizing resource mobilization and political opportunity structures are increasingly complemented by analyses that foreground the significance of framing, identity construction, and digital technologies.  Recent movements, such as #MeToo and Black Lives Matter, demonstrate the power of networked activism and the strategic use of social media to circumvent traditional gatekeepers and amplify marginalized voices.  However, these digital landscapes also present challenges, including the spread of misinformation and the potential for co-optation by established power structures.  The presentation will explore these complexities, highlighting how contemporary social movements leverage new media while confronting the inherent limitations and risks.  It will further analyze the varying degrees of success achieved by different movements, considering factors such as the level of institutional support, the nature of counter-movements, and the broader political context.  Ultimately, this presentation argues for a nuanced understanding of social movements as dynamic, multifaceted actors capable of both profound societal transformation and significant limitations, shaped by a confluence of factors both online and offline.
