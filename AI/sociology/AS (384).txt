Education plays a multifaceted role in shaping and perpetuating, or challenging and transforming, societal norms. This paper explores the complex interplay between educational systems and the transmission of cultural values, examining both the intended and unintended consequences of pedagogical practices.  Formal curricula explicitly transmit knowledge and skills, often reinforcing existing norms through the selection of content and pedagogical approaches.  However, the hidden curriculum, encompassing the informal rules and values implicitly communicated within educational settings, exerts a significant influence, shaping students' perceptions of social hierarchies, power dynamics, and appropriate behavior.  Furthermore, peer interactions within educational environments contribute to norm formation and reinforcement, with social learning processes shaping individual attitudes and beliefs. While education can serve as a powerful instrument for social change by promoting critical thinking, challenging dominant ideologies, and fostering inclusivity, its capacity to effect transformative change is often constrained by broader societal structures and power relations.  Ultimately, understanding the nuanced relationship between education and social norm formation requires a critical analysis of both formal and informal learning processes within their socio-political context.
