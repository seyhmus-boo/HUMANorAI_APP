Education's role in shaping social norms is a multifaceted and deeply influential process.  This review examines existing literature demonstrating education's capacity to both reinforce and challenge prevailing societal expectations.  Formal schooling, through curricula and pedagogy, transmits established norms, fostering social cohesion and shared values.  However, critical analysis reveals education's potential to act as an agent of social change, fostering critical thinking and challenging ingrained biases.  Studies highlight the impact of educational interventions on attitudes toward gender equality, environmental sustainability, and intergroup relations, suggesting a direct correlation between educational attainment and progressive social shifts.  Conversely, the perpetuation of inequalities within educational systems themselves, including disparities in access and resource allocation, can reinforce existing social stratification and limit the transformative potential of education.  Future research should focus on developing inclusive pedagogical approaches that actively challenge harmful norms while promoting critical engagement with diverse perspectives.  Understanding the complex interplay between education and social norms is crucial for designing effective strategies to achieve equitable and socially just societies.
