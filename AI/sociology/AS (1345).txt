This presentation examines the persistent issue of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on society, drawing upon historical context to illuminate contemporary challenges.  Historically, class stratification, while manifesting differently across eras and geographical locations, has consistently shaped access to resources, opportunities, and power. From feudal systems to industrial capitalism, disparities in wealth and status have fueled social unrest and limited societal progress.  This presentation will analyze the evolution of class structures, highlighting the enduring influence of factors such as inheritance, education, and occupation on intergenerational mobility.  We will explore the consequences of entrenched inequality, including its impact on health outcomes, educational attainment, political participation, and social cohesion.  Specific attention will be given to the detrimental effects of concentrated wealth on democratic processes and the erosion of social trust.  Furthermore, the presentation will briefly consider potential policy interventions aimed at mitigating class inequality, acknowledging the complexities and challenges involved in addressing such a deeply ingrained societal feature.  The ultimate aim is to stimulate discussion around the persistent relevance of class inequality and its profound implications for a just and equitable future.
