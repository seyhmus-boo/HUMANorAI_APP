This presentation explores the multifaceted role of education in shaping and transforming social norms.  While often viewed as a mechanism for individual skill development, education serves a crucial societal function in transmitting, reinforcing, or challenging prevailing norms.  We examine this influence through three key lenses: the curriculum's explicit and implicit messaging regarding social values and behaviours; the hidden curriculum, encompassing the informal learning environment and social interactions within educational institutions; and the transformative potential of critical pedagogy in fostering self-reflection and challenging established norms.  Drawing on sociological and educational literature, we analyze case studies illustrating how educational contexts can both perpetuate inequalities and biases embedded in existing norms and, conversely, cultivate social change through promoting inclusivity, critical thinking, and empathy.  The presentation argues that intentional curriculum design, coupled with a supportive learning environment fostering critical engagement, is pivotal in leveraging education's power to positively shape social norms, promoting equitable and just societies.  We conclude by suggesting avenues for future research focused on measuring the long-term impact of educational interventions on norm change and advocating for education's proactive role in societal transformation.
