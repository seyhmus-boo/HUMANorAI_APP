This presentation explores the role of education in shaping social norms through a novel lens: quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate, the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement offer a compelling framework for understanding the dynamic and interconnected nature of societal values.  We propose that individual beliefs, analogous to quantum states, exist in a superposition prior to education.  Formal and informal educational experiences act as measurement operators, collapsing this superposition into a more defined, yet probabilistic, social norm adherence.  The strength of these "measurements" is influenced by factors such as educator pedagogy, social context, and individual predispositions.  Further, the entanglement of individual beliefs, facilitated by social interaction and the transmission of knowledge, leads to correlated social norms within groups and communities.  We will examine how differing educational methodologies may produce varying degrees of entanglement, resulting in diverse and potentially conflicting social norms across different populations. This perspective offers a fresh approach to understanding the complex interplay between individual learning, social influence, and the evolution of collective behaviors, suggesting avenues for designing more effective educational strategies capable of fostering positive social change.
