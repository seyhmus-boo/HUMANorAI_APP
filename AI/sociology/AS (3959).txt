The conventional understanding of the relationship between economic policies and social well-being largely relies on classical and neoclassical economic models, often neglecting the inherently complex and interconnected nature of societal systems.  This paper proposes a novel framework for analyzing this relationship by drawing parallels with quantum mechanical principles. We posit that social well-being, akin to a quantum state, is not a simply measurable quantity but a superposition of various factors, including health, education, income distribution, and environmental sustainability, each contributing with a specific weight.  Economic policies, therefore, can be viewed as operators that act upon this superposition, potentially leading to measurable changes in the overall social well-being "wave function."  This approach departs from deterministic models, acknowledging the inherent uncertainty and probabilistic nature of social outcomes.  By utilizing concepts such as entanglement (interdependence of social factors), superposition (simultaneous existence of multiple well-being states), and measurement problem (difficulties in accurately assessing well-being), we aim to provide a more nuanced understanding of how economic interventions impact social outcomes. This quantum-inspired lens offers a potential pathway to developing more effective and targeted policies that account for the intricate interplay of social determinants.
