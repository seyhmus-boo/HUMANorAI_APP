Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, has profound and multifaceted effects on social structures and individual well-being.  This presentation will explore the historical trajectory of class inequality, tracing its evolution from agrarian societies with rigid caste systems to the more fluid, yet still stratified, systems of modern capitalism.  We will examine how historical processes, including enclosure movements, industrialization, and neoliberal policies, have shaped and exacerbated existing inequalities.  The presentation will then analyze the societal consequences of this inequality, focusing on its impact on key social indicators such as health outcomes, educational attainment, and political participation.  We will demonstrate how unequal access to resources and opportunities reinforces existing power structures and perpetuates cycles of disadvantage across generations.  Furthermore, we will discuss the link between class inequality and social unrest, highlighting the potential for heightened social instability in contexts characterized by significant disparities in wealth and power.  Finally, the presentation will briefly consider potential policy interventions aimed at mitigating the negative consequences of class inequality and promoting a more equitable society.
