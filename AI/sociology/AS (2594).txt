This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, drawing upon insights from anthropology, sociology, and economics. While globalization fosters interconnectedness and cultural exchange, its effects on local traditions and identities are complex and often contested.  We examine the phenomenon of cultural homogenization, analyzing the spread of globalized consumerism and media's role in shaping cultural norms, potentially leading to the erosion of unique cultural practices.  Conversely, we consider the processes of glocalization and hybridity, where global influences are adapted and integrated into existing cultural frameworks, creating novel forms of cultural expression.  This interdisciplinary approach will utilize case studies to illuminate the diverse experiences of communities facing globalization's pressures.  Specifically, we will investigate how economic policies impact cultural preservation efforts and the role of social movements in resisting cultural appropriation and promoting cultural resilience.  The presentation concludes by considering strategies for fostering sustainable cultural development in a globalized world, emphasizing the importance of acknowledging both the challenges and opportunities presented by increased interconnectedness.
