This paper examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth alone is insufficient to guarantee improved societal outcomes.  We posit that a nuanced understanding requires analyzing the distributional effects of various policy choices, considering their impact on factors such as health, education, and environmental sustainability.  While policies promoting economic growth, such as deregulation or tax incentives, can potentially increase overall wealth, their benefits may not be evenly distributed, leading to increased inequality and social unrest.  Conversely, policies prioritizing social welfare, such as universal basic income or robust social safety nets, may moderate economic growth in the short-term but contribute to greater social equity, reducing poverty and improving overall population health and well-being. The paper employs a multi-faceted approach, incorporating theoretical frameworks from welfare economics and empirical evidence from diverse national contexts to demonstrate the complex interplay between economic performance and social indicators. Ultimately, we advocate for a policy paradigm shift that integrates social well-being as a primary objective alongside economic growth, necessitating a holistic assessment of policy impacts across multiple dimensions.  Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated metrics capable of capturing the multifaceted nature of social well-being and its intricate relationship with economic policy interventions.
