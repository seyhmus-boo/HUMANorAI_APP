The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has long been a central theme in economic and social science research.  While traditional macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth have been predominantly utilized to measure societal progress, recent scholarship increasingly emphasizes a more holistic approach, recognizing the limitations of solely relying on economic output as a proxy for well-being.  This paper examines the evolving understanding of this complex interplay, focusing on recent developments that challenge conventional wisdom.  Specifically, we explore the growing recognition of the distributional effects of economic policies, acknowledging that aggregate economic growth does not necessarily translate into improved well-being for all segments of society.  Furthermore, we investigate the rising importance of non-monetary factors, such as environmental sustainability, social inclusion, and mental health, in shaping overall societal well-being.  The paper analyzes the implications of these shifts for policy design, considering the emergence of alternative policy frameworks that prioritize inclusive growth and the measurement of multidimensional well-being indicators beyond traditional economic metrics.  Finally, we examine emerging debates regarding the effectiveness of different policy interventions in achieving genuine social progress.
