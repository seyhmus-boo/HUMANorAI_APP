Education's role in shaping social norms remains a complex and under-researched area, hampered by methodological challenges in isolating its independent effects. This abstract addresses experimental limitations in studying this relationship.  While observational studies reveal correlations between educational attainment and prosocial behaviours, establishing causality requires robust experimental designs.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) face significant challenges: ethical concerns surrounding educational manipulation, difficulty in creating homogenous intervention groups, and the long-term nature of norm internalization, demanding extensive follow-up periods.  Furthermore, spillover effects within and beyond treatment groups confound analyses, making it challenging to isolate the specific impact of educational interventions.  Natural experiments, like educational reforms or policy changes, offer valuable opportunities but are frequently limited by pre-existing confounding variables and the lack of precise control over treatment assignment.  Future research should prioritize innovative experimental approaches, such as leveraging digital platforms for targeted interventions and employing sophisticated statistical techniques to address confounding and address the complex interplay between education, individual agency, and evolving social norms.  Addressing these methodological hurdles is crucial for a more nuanced understanding of education's transformative potential.
