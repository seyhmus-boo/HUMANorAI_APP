This paper investigates the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, exploring the extent to which various policy interventions influence societal outcomes beyond simple economic growth.  We posit that a multifaceted approach, encompassing both macroeconomic and microeconomic strategies, is crucial for achieving holistic social well-being.  Analysis focuses on the impact of policies such as progressive taxation, social safety nets (including unemployment benefits and universal basic income), investment in education and healthcare, and environmental regulations.  Our findings suggest a strong correlation between equitable wealth distribution, facilitated by progressive taxation and robust social safety nets, and improved metrics of social well-being, including reduced poverty and inequality, enhanced health outcomes, and increased life satisfaction.  Conversely, policies prioritizing solely economic growth without addressing distributional concerns can exacerbate social disparities.  Practical applications of this research include informing policy decisions aimed at optimizing the balance between economic growth and social equity. This necessitates a shift towards evidence-based policymaking that prioritizes the holistic measurement of social well-being and incorporates diverse perspectives in the policy design process, ultimately promoting a more just and equitable society.
