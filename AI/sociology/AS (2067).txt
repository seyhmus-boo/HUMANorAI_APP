The advent of social media, while relatively recent, has profoundly impacted human behaviour, necessitating a critical examination of its influence.  Prior to its widespread adoption, interpersonal communication largely relied on face-to-face interaction and traditional media, fostering distinct social dynamics.  The rise of platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram marked a paradigm shift, enabling unprecedented connectivity and information dissemination.  However, this connectivity has presented both opportunities and challenges.  

Studies indicate a correlation between extensive social media use and increased rates of anxiety, depression, and body image issues, potentially linked to social comparison and cyberbullying. Conversely, social media facilitates the formation of online communities, enabling social support and mobilization around shared interests or causes. The constant pursuit of validation through likes and shares can foster addictive behaviours and a distorted perception of reality, while curated online personas can mask genuine self-expression. Ultimately, understanding the nuanced impact of social media requires a multifaceted approach, acknowledging its dual nature as both a tool for connection and a source of potential psychological distress.
