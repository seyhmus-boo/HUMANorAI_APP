Rapid urbanization presents a complex interplay of opportunities and challenges for community life, a dynamic increasingly shaped by recent technological and socio-political developments. This presentation examines the evolving impact of urbanization on community cohesion, social capital, and well-being.  Recent research highlights a nuanced picture, moving beyond simplistic narratives of urban decay and anomie.  We explore the emergence of digitally-mediated community spaces, analyzing their contribution to both strengthening existing ties and fostering new forms of social interaction, alongside the potential for increased social isolation and inequality.  Furthermore, the presentation considers the role of urban planning and policy in shaping community life, focusing on recent initiatives promoting inclusive urban development and fostering resilient communities.  Case studies from diverse urban contexts will illustrate the multifaceted nature of these interactions, highlighting both the positive impacts of innovative community-based interventions and the persistent challenges posed by unequal access to resources and opportunities.  Finally, we will discuss the need for interdisciplinary approaches to better understand and address the evolving relationship between urbanization and community well-being.
