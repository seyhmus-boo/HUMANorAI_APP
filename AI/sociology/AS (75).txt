This paper investigates the complex relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simple correlation to explore causal pathways and mediating factors.  We analyze a multi-faceted definition of social well-being encompassing health, education, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability, examining how macroeconomic policies (fiscal, monetary, and trade) influence these dimensions across diverse national contexts.  Our findings suggest that while economic growth is a necessary but insufficient condition for improved social well-being,  the distributional effects of economic policies are crucial.  Policies prioritizing inclusive growth, such as progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and investments in human capital, demonstrably correlate with higher levels of social well-being indicators. Conversely, policies favoring deregulation or austerity measures often exacerbate inequalities and negatively impact vulnerable populations.  Practical applications include informing policy design for poverty reduction,  improving public health outcomes through targeted interventions, and fostering sustainable development initiatives.  Further research should focus on quantifying the long-term impacts of specific policy instruments and exploring the role of institutional factors in mediating the relationship between economic policies and societal outcomes.
