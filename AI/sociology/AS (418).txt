This presentation examines the crucial role of social movements in driving societal change throughout history.  From the abolitionist movement’s dismantling of slavery to the suffragette movement’s securing of women's suffrage, and more recently, the Civil Rights Movement and LGBTQ+ rights movements, collective action has demonstrably reshaped social norms and political landscapes.  We will explore the historical trajectory of social movements, highlighting key phases and the evolving strategies employed, ranging from grassroots mobilization and civil disobedience to digital activism and transnational networks.  The presentation will analyze the factors contributing to a movement’s success or failure, emphasizing the interplay of  resource mobilization, framing, and political opportunity structures.  It will also address the complexities of social movement outcomes, acknowledging both intended consequences and unintended repercussions.  Finally, the presentation will consider the enduring relevance of social movements in addressing contemporary challenges, such as climate change, economic inequality, and social justice issues, proposing avenues for future research into their evolving dynamics and impact on a globalized world.
