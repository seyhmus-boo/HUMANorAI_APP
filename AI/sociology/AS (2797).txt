This presentation explores the multifaceted role of education in shaping societal norms, drawing upon interdisciplinary perspectives from sociology, psychology, and pedagogy.  We argue that education acts not merely as a transmitter of knowledge, but as a crucial agent of socialization, influencing individual beliefs, values, and behaviors, and subsequently, collective norms.  The presentation will examine how curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment contribute to the internalization of societal expectations and the reinforcement of existing power structures.  We will analyze the impact of different educational models—from traditional rote learning to more participatory and critical approaches—on the development of prosocial behaviors, tolerance, and civic engagement.  Furthermore, we will explore the interconnections between formal education and informal learning environments, considering how family, community, and media influences interact with school-based socialization.  By integrating insights from these diverse fields, this presentation aims to highlight the complex interplay between education and the construction of social norms, ultimately suggesting avenues for utilizing education to promote positive social change and challenge harmful norms.
