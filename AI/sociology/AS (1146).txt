The societal understanding and treatment of mental illness have undergone a dramatic transformation throughout history, evolving from supernatural explanations and stigmatization to the contemporary, albeit still imperfect, biomedical model. This paper explores the sociology of mental health, examining how social structures, cultural norms, and power dynamics shape both the experience and outcome of mental illness. Historically, individuals experiencing mental distress were often relegated to asylums, subjected to inhumane treatment, and marginalized within society.  The rise of the medical model in the late 19th and 20th centuries, while offering advancements in diagnosis and treatment, also inadvertently contributed to the medicalization of deviance and the pathologization of everyday distress.  This shift, however, failed to fully address the social determinants of mental health, such as poverty, inequality, and discrimination. This research investigates the persistent social inequalities affecting access to care, the influence of social stigma on help-seeking behaviour, and the broader societal implications of mental illness, including its impact on productivity, family dynamics, and the justice system.  Ultimately, this paper argues for a more holistic approach that integrates sociological perspectives with biological and psychological understandings to promote mental well-being and reduce the pervasive social burden of mental health challenges.
