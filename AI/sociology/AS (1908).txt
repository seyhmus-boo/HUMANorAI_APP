This paper proposes a novel framework for understanding class inequality and its societal effects, drawing upon the conceptual apparatus of quantum mechanics. While seemingly disparate, the principles of superposition, entanglement, and wave-particle duality offer illuminating parallels to the complex, intertwined nature of socioeconomic stratification.  We posit that societal structures, analogous to quantum systems, exist in a state of superposition, simultaneously exhibiting both stability and inherent instability, reflecting the co-existence of seemingly opposing forces like wealth accumulation and social mobility.  Furthermore, the interconnectedness of individual agents within the socio-economic system mirrors quantum entanglement; the fate of one individual is inextricably linked to the collective, influencing the overall societal "wave function."  We explore how the wave-particle duality of social actors – behaving sometimes as independent agents and sometimes as part of a collective – impacts the dynamics of inequality, particularly focusing on the propagation of both economic and social capital across different strata.  Finally, we propose that  a quantifiable measure of societal "entanglement" can be developed, offering a novel metric for analyzing the resilience and vulnerability of a society to the destabilizing effects of extreme class disparity.  This interdisciplinary approach aims to contribute a fresh perspective to a long-standing societal challenge.
