The relationship between economic policies and social well-being has been a central theme in economics and political science for centuries.  Historically, laissez-faire policies, dominant from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention, often resulting in significant social inequalities and periodic crises.  The Great Depression spurred a shift towards Keynesian economics, emphasizing government intervention to manage aggregate demand and mitigate unemployment, leading to improvements in social safety nets and reduced income disparity in many developed nations.  However, the latter half of the 20th century witnessed the rise of neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation, privatization, and market liberalization, often accompanied by increased income inequality and social stratification.  Contemporary research increasingly highlights the nuanced and complex relationship between economic growth and social well-being, suggesting that solely focusing on GDP growth may neglect crucial dimensions such as health, education, environmental sustainability, and social cohesion.  This necessitates a more holistic approach to policy-making, integrating diverse indicators of well-being and incorporating considerations of equity and sustainability alongside economic efficiency to achieve truly beneficial societal outcomes.  Future research should explore causal mechanisms linking specific policy interventions to multifaceted measures of well-being, accounting for contextual factors and potential unintended consequences.
