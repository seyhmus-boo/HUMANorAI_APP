Cultural diversity, a defining feature of increasingly globalized societies, has a complex and multifaceted relationship with social integration. Historically, periods of significant migration and intercultural contact, such as the post-colonial era and contemporary globalization, have witnessed both increased social cohesion and intensified social fragmentation. This abstract examines the influence of cultural diversity on social integration, drawing upon existing sociological and psychological literature.  Early assimilationist models posited a linear path towards integration, emphasizing the adoption of dominant cultural norms. However, more recent research highlights the limitations of such models, emphasizing the importance of multiculturalism and the potential for hybrid identities to foster social harmony.  Studies suggest that factors such as institutional policies promoting inclusivity, intergroup contact characterized by positive interactions, and the presence of strong social networks within and across cultural groups significantly affect the level of social integration achieved. Conversely, factors like prejudice, discrimination, and socioeconomic inequalities can hinder integration and exacerbate intergroup tensions.  Future research should focus on developing nuanced models that account for the dynamic interplay between cultural diversity, social policies, and individual agency in shaping social integration outcomes.
