Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies throughout history, continues to exert a profound and multifaceted impact on social structures and individual well-being. From ancient agrarian societies marked by rigid caste systems to the industrialized nations of the modern era, disparities in wealth, power, and status have shaped social relations and determined access to resources.  Historical analysis reveals the evolution of inequality from feudal hierarchies, where land ownership dictated social standing, to the capitalist system characterized by the concentration of wealth in the hands of a relatively small elite.  While industrialization and technological advancements promised increased prosperity for all, they simultaneously amplified existing inequalities, creating stark divides between the burgeoning bourgeoisie and the industrial working class, a dynamic explored extensively by Marx and subsequent theorists. This disparity has manifested in various ways, impacting not only economic outcomes but also influencing health outcomes, educational attainment, and political participation. This research paper examines the multifaceted nature of class inequality in contemporary society, investigating its root causes, manifestations, and consequential effects on social cohesion, political stability, and overall societal well-being.  It will explore the ongoing debate surrounding effective strategies for mitigation and the enduring challenge of fostering a more equitable and just society.
