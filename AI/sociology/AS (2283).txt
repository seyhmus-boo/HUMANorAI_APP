This presentation explores the complex and often contested relationship between economic policies and social well-being, focusing on the inherent challenges of establishing robust causal links through experimental methods. While randomized controlled trials (RCTs) offer a powerful tool for evaluating policy impact, their application to macroeconomic policies faces significant limitations.  The presentation will examine these limitations, including the difficulties in achieving truly random assignment at a large scale, the ethical concerns of manipulating economic variables, and the inherent complexities of measuring social well-being, which encompasses multifaceted dimensions like health, education, and social cohesion.  We discuss the challenges of external validity, considering the generalizability of findings from localized or specific interventions to diverse socio-economic contexts.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the methodological nuances of dealing with spillover effects and the long-term impacts of policies, arguing that conventional experimental designs often fall short of capturing these crucial aspects.  Finally, we will propose alternative approaches, such as natural experiments and quasi-experimental designs, and discuss their potential to supplement traditional RCTs in enriching our understanding of the multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being.
