This presentation explores the hitherto unconsidered application of quantum mechanical principles to understanding the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  Traditional economic models often rely on classical deterministic frameworks, neglecting the inherent uncertainty and probabilistic nature of human behavior and societal dynamics.  We propose a novel framework leveraging concepts from quantum mechanics, specifically superposition and entanglement, to model the complex interplay of individual choices, policy interventions, and emergent social outcomes.  Superposition can represent the multitude of potential societal states influenced by economic policies, while entanglement reflects the interconnectedness of individual well-being and macroeconomic indicators.  We argue that policies, acting as "measurements" on this quantum system, collapse the superposition, resulting in a specific societal state with a corresponding level of social well-being.  This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of policy effectiveness, acknowledging the inherent probabilistic nature of social outcomes and the limitations of predictive models based on classical assumptions.  The presentation will outline the foundational principles of this framework and discuss its potential applications in policy design, emphasizing the need for a more holistic, quantum-inspired approach to socio-economic modeling.
