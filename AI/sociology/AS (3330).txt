Globalization's impact on local cultures can be conceptually modeled using quantum mechanical principles of superposition and entanglement.  Prior to significant globalization, a culture exists in a relatively isolated superposition, exhibiting a distinct probability amplitude for its unique traditions and practices.  Increased globalization acts as a perturbation, introducing entanglement with other cultural systems.  This entanglement leads to a superposition of cultural elements, with the probability amplitudes of traditional practices decreasing and those of hybridized, globalized forms increasing.  

The degree of entanglement depends on factors analogous to coupling strengths in quantum systems: the intensity of global media exposure, migration patterns, and economic integration.  Strong coupling leads to rapid decoherence of the original cultural superposition, resulting in a more homogenized global culture.  Weaker coupling allows for a more resilient superposition, exhibiting a greater degree of cultural persistence despite globalization.  However, even in weaker coupling scenarios, the entangled state inherently alters the original culture, creating a new superposition distinct from its pre-globalization state.  The irreversible nature of measurement in quantum mechanics parallels the irreversible transformation of local cultures under globalization's influence.
