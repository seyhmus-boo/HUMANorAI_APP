This presentation examines the evolving role of education in shaping social norms, considering recent developments in educational theory and practice.  While traditionally focused on transmitting knowledge and skills, education increasingly recognizes its potent influence on societal values and behaviors.  We explore how curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment contribute to the normalization of specific attitudes and actions.  Recent research highlights the effectiveness of inclusive education in challenging discriminatory norms, while conversely, we analyze how educational systems can inadvertently perpetuate existing inequalities through biased curricula or implicit pedagogical biases.  Furthermore, the rise of digital technologies and online learning presents both opportunities and challenges, impacting the dissemination and reinforcement of social norms through novel platforms and interactive experiences.  This presentation will synthesize recent empirical findings to illuminate the complex interplay between education, social norms, and societal change, arguing for a more critically conscious approach to curriculum development and pedagogy that actively fosters positive social transformation.  Finally, we will briefly discuss implications for policy and future research directions.
