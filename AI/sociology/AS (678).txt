This paper explores the previously unconsidered application of quantum mechanical principles to understand the complex relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  We posit that societal well-being can be modeled as a superposition of states, representing diverse individual experiences and outcomes influenced by economic policy interventions.  These interventions, analogous to quantum measurements, collapse the wave function of societal well-being, resulting in a specific observed outcome.  Different policies, corresponding to distinct measurement operators, yield varying probability distributions across these well-being states.  The concept of entanglement is introduced to capture the interconnectedness of individual well-being within a societal system; policies impacting one sector can significantly influence others through correlated changes in individual states.  We propose a framework employing density matrix formalism to quantify the overall well-being of the system, considering both the average state and the variance (uncertainty) reflecting societal inequality.  Preliminary analysis suggests that policies aiming for maximum average well-being might neglect minimizing variance, leading to potentially unstable and inequitable outcomes.  Further research is needed to develop this framework and empirically validate the proposed quantum-inspired model, paving the way for a more nuanced understanding and optimization of economic policy for social well-being.
