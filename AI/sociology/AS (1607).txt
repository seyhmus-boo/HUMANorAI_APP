Social movements, collective actions aimed at achieving social or political change, have played a pivotal role in reshaping societies throughout history.  From abolitionist movements challenging slavery to the suffrage movement securing women's voting rights, their impact is undeniable.  Historically, these movements emerged from grievances stemming from social inequalities, economic disparities, or political oppression.  

Theories explaining their efficacy range from resource mobilization approaches, emphasizing the acquisition and deployment of resources, to framing theories, focusing on the construction of shared meanings and narratives that galvanize support.  Successful movements effectively frame their grievances, mobilizing collective action through various tactics, including protests, civil disobedience, and lobbying.  However, success is contingent upon factors such as the level of state repression, the prevailing socio-political context, and the internal organization and cohesion of the movement itself. Ultimately, social movements act as agents of societal transformation, challenging established power structures and driving significant shifts in norms, values, and policies.
