This presentation explores the crucial role of education in shaping and reshaping social norms.  We posit that education, beyond the transmission of knowledge and skills, acts as a powerful agent of socialization, influencing attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours that collectively constitute societal norms.  The curriculum, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment all contribute to this process, either reinforcing existing norms or fostering the adoption of new ones.  We will examine how formal education can promote prosocial behaviours, such as tolerance, cooperation, and respect for diversity, by incorporating inclusive curricula and fostering critical thinking skills.  Conversely, we will discuss how educational systems can inadvertently perpetuate harmful norms, such as gender stereotypes or social inequalities, through biased content or implicit pedagogical practices.  Practical applications will be discussed, including the design of culturally sensitive curricula addressing issues like gender equality, environmental sustainability, and civic engagement.  These applications will encompass teacher training programs focused on promoting inclusive pedagogy and the implementation of evidence-based interventions to challenge existing harmful norms.  Ultimately, we argue that a deliberate and critical approach to education design is essential for harnessing its power to create more equitable and just societies.
