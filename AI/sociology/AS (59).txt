Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have profoundly shaped societal change throughout history.  From the abolitionist movement dismantling slavery to the suffrage movement securing women's voting rights, their impact is undeniable.  Early scholarship, often focused on resource mobilization and political opportunity structures, emphasized the role of organizational capacity and favourable political contexts in movement success.  However, more recent theoretical frameworks, such as framing theory and new social movement theory, highlight the crucial role of collective identity formation, framing of issues, and the utilization of diverse tactics, including non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.  These movements not only challenge existing power structures but also contribute to the evolution of social norms and values, often through protracted processes of contestation and negotiation.  The success of a movement hinges on factors including the mobilization of resources, strategic framing of grievances, effective leadership, and a favourable political environment, while failure often stems from internal divisions, state repression, or co-optation by dominant groups.  Studying social movements, therefore, provides crucial insights into the dynamics of power, the processes of social change, and the ongoing struggle for social justice.
