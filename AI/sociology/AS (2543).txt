The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has long been a subject of intense scholarly debate.  While traditional macroeconomic models often prioritize economic growth as the primary indicator of societal progress, a growing body of research emphasizes the crucial role of social factors in achieving sustainable and equitable development.  Recent developments highlight a shift away from purely growth-centric approaches, acknowledging the limitations of GDP as a sole measure of well-being and the significant impact of economic policies on a wider range of social outcomes.

This paper examines the multifaceted links between economic policies and social well-being, focusing on recent advancements in the field.  We investigate the implications of various policy instruments, including fiscal policy, monetary policy, and social welfare programs, on key dimensions of social well-being such as health, education, inequality, and environmental sustainability.  Particular attention will be paid to the growing recognition of the social determinants of health and the increasing emphasis on inclusive growth strategies.  Furthermore, we analyze the impact of recent global crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, which have underscored the vulnerabilities within existing economic and social systems and highlighted the urgent need for more robust and equitable policies.  Ultimately, this research aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how economic choices directly shape societal outcomes and inform the design of policies that genuinely promote both economic prosperity and social justice.
