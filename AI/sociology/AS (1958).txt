Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies since the Neolithic Revolution's emergence of stratified social structures, refers to the unequal distribution of resources, power, and opportunities based on socioeconomic status.  Historically, feudal systems starkly exemplified this, with rigid hierarchies determining access to land and wealth.  Industrialization, while increasing overall wealth, exacerbated inequality, concentrating power in the hands of industrialists and landowners while creating a large, often exploited, working class.  This historical trajectory continues to shape contemporary societies.

The effects of class inequality are far-reaching.  Economically, it limits social mobility, perpetuating cycles of poverty and hindering economic growth by restricting access to education and capital for lower classes.  Socially, it fosters resentment, distrust, and social fragmentation, potentially leading to political instability and increased crime rates.  Furthermore, inequality impacts health outcomes, with lower socioeconomic groups experiencing higher rates of morbidity and mortality due to reduced access to healthcare and nutritious food.  Ultimately, pervasive class inequality undermines social cohesion and threatens the long-term stability and prosperity of any society.
