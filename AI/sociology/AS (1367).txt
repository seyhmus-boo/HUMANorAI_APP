Education's role in shaping social norms is a multifaceted and significant area of inquiry. This review examines the literature exploring this complex relationship, highlighting education's influence across various dimensions.  Formal schooling transmits explicit norms through curricula and pedagogy, fostering civic engagement, promoting values such as equality and tolerance, and shaping attitudes towards social issues.  However, the implicit transmission of norms, through school culture and peer interactions, is equally impactful, often reinforcing existing social hierarchies and inequalities.  Studies demonstrate a correlation between educational attainment and prosocial behaviors, but this relationship is not always straightforward, with variations dependent on contextual factors such as socioeconomic status and the specific educational system.  Furthermore, critical pedagogy challenges the inherent biases within educational systems, advocating for transformative education that actively deconstructs harmful norms and fosters social justice.  Future research should investigate the effectiveness of specific pedagogical approaches in fostering positive social change, considering the interplay between formal and informal learning environments and their varying impacts on diverse populations.  A more nuanced understanding of these dynamics is crucial for designing effective educational interventions aiming to cultivate socially responsible citizens and equitable societies.
