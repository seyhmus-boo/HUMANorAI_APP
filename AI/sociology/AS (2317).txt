This presentation explores the multifaceted impacts of urbanization on community life, emphasizing the crucial interdisciplinary connections needed for a comprehensive understanding.  Rapid urbanization, a defining characteristic of the 21st century, fundamentally reshapes social structures, ecological balances, and economic systems.  We argue that a solely sociological or economic analysis is insufficient to grasp the complexity of these changes.

The presentation will draw on insights from sociology, examining shifts in social capital, community cohesion, and the emergence of new social inequalities within urban environments.  It will also integrate perspectives from environmental science, highlighting the impacts of urban sprawl on biodiversity, resource consumption, and pollution levels, which in turn affect community health and well-being.  Furthermore, contributions from urban planning and geography will be incorporated to analyze spatial patterns of urban development and their influence on community accessibility, connectivity, and social interaction.  By weaving together these perspectives, we aim to demonstrate the urgent need for interdisciplinary collaboration in developing sustainable and socially equitable urban strategies that foster vibrant and resilient communities within rapidly changing urban landscapes.  The presentation will conclude by suggesting potential avenues for future interdisciplinary research in this critical area.
