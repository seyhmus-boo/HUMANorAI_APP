This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in researching the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration.  While a positive correlation between diversity and innovation is often posited, the mechanisms through which cultural diversity impacts social cohesion remain complex and contested.  We highlight the methodological hurdles in designing experiments that accurately capture the nuanced interplay of cultural factors, individual attitudes, and contextual variables influencing social integration.  Specifically, we discuss the difficulties in operationalizing "culture" itself, avoiding essentialist interpretations, and accounting for the heterogeneity within and between cultural groups.  Furthermore, we address the ethical considerations of manipulating cultural variables in experimental settings and the potential for unintended consequences, such as the reinforcement of stereotypes.  Finally, we propose a framework for future research that leverages mixed-methods approaches, focusing on participant-led methodologies and emphasizing the importance of context-specific analysis to move beyond simplistic models and offer more robust understandings of the complex dynamics between diversity and social integration.  This will contribute to a more nuanced and ethically responsible investigation of this vital societal issue.
