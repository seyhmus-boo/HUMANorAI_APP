Social norms, the unwritten rules governing behavior within a society, are fundamental to social order and cohesion.  While often implicitly acquired, the process of their formation and transmission is increasingly understood to be significantly influenced by educational institutions. This research paper examines the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms, moving beyond a simple transmission model to explore its capacity for both reinforcing existing norms and promoting societal change. We will analyze how formal curricula, informal interactions within educational settings, and the broader social environment of schools contribute to the internalization of norms related to various aspects of social life, including gender roles, civic engagement, and ethical conduct.  Furthermore, we will investigate the mechanisms through which education can effectively challenge and alter pre-existing norms, focusing on the role of critical thinking, exposure to diverse perspectives, and the development of empathy.  The practical applications of this research are significant, offering insights into the design of more effective educational interventions aimed at promoting positive social change, combating prejudice, and fostering inclusive and equitable societies. This includes informing curriculum development, teacher training, and the creation of supportive learning environments conducive to the internalization of prosocial norms.
