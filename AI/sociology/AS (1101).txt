This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, drawing upon interdisciplinary perspectives from anthropology, sociology, and economics. While globalization fosters interconnectedness and cultural exchange, its effects on local traditions are complex and often contested.  We examine the homogenizing forces of globalization, such as the spread of global brands and media, and their potential to erode cultural diversity and linguistic vitality.  Conversely, we analyze the processes of glocalization, where global trends are adapted and reinterpreted within specific local contexts, demonstrating cultural resilience and hybridity.  The economic dimensions of globalization, including tourism and international trade, are examined for their influence on cultural preservation and commodification.  By integrating insights from these disciplines, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the intricate relationship between globalization and local cultures, moving beyond simplistic narratives of either cultural dominance or unwavering resistance. The presentation will conclude by discussing the implications for cultural policy and sustainable development in a globalized world.
