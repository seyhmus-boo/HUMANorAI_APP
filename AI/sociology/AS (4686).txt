Education's role in shaping social norms is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate, yet recent developments underscore its profound and multifaceted influence.  Traditional perspectives emphasized education's transmission of established norms, promoting social cohesion and stability. However, contemporary research highlights its capacity for both reinforcing and challenging existing societal structures.  

Recent studies emphasize the crucial role of educational institutions in fostering critical thinking and challenging ingrained biases.  The rise of inclusive curricula and pedagogical approaches, promoting diversity and intercultural understanding, actively shape evolving social norms around issues such as gender equality, racial justice, and environmental sustainability.  Furthermore, digital technologies integrated into education provide unprecedented access to diverse perspectives, potentially accelerating the pace of social norm change.

However, criticisms remain.  Educational systems can inadvertently perpetuate existing inequalities and biases through curriculum content and pedagogical practices.  The uneven distribution of educational resources across socioeconomic groups contributes to the reproduction of social stratification.  Therefore, while education possesses significant potential for positive social transformation, realizing this potential demands critical examination of its own internal structures and practices.
