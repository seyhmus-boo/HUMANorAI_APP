This presentation examines the ongoing evolution of gender roles in contemporary societies, focusing on recent shifts and persistent challenges. While traditional gender binaries have demonstrably weakened,  a complete dismantling remains elusive. We will analyze recent sociological and anthropological studies highlighting the complexities of this transition.  Specifically, we'll explore the impact of increased female participation in the workforce on both professional and domestic spheres,  including the persistent gender pay gap and the unequal distribution of childcare responsibilities.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the burgeoning discourse surrounding gender fluidity and non-binary identities, considering their implications for social structures and legal frameworks.  Finally, we will discuss the role of social media and digital platforms in both challenging and reinforcing existing gender norms, exploring how online activism intersects with offline social change.  By considering both macro-level societal changes and micro-level individual experiences, this presentation aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the evolving landscape of gender roles and the continuing struggle for gender equality in the 21st century.
