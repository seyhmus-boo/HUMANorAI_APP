Class inequality, a persistent societal ill, casts a long shadow across numerous aspects of human experience.  This presentation will explore the multifaceted consequences of this pervasive stratification, utilizing accessible analogies to illuminate its complex mechanisms. We can consider society as an orchestra:  with extreme class inequality, a small number of highly skilled musicians (the elite) dominate the performance, while the vast majority, playing subpar instruments or lacking them altogether, are relegated to the background or silence. This imbalance produces a discordant, unsatisfying, and ultimately unstable composition.

Further, we will explore the concept of a societal "ecosystem."  Like a rainforest where a few dominant species consume disproportionate resources, leading to biodiversity loss, concentrated wealth and power within a small segment of society starve opportunities for others, hindering social mobility and overall societal health. This lack of social mobility can be likened to a rigged game of cards:  those born into advantageous circumstances hold a superior hand from the outset, regardless of their skill or effort.

Finally, the presentation will briefly analyze potential policy interventions, suggesting avenues towards a more equitable distribution of resources and opportunities â€“ akin to re-orchestrating the ensemble or restoring balance to a depleted ecosystem, ensuring a more harmonious and flourishing society for all.  These interventions, ultimately, aim to create a society where the "playing field" is levelled and the potential of all its "musicians" can be fully realized.
