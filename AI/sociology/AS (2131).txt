This presentation explores the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change, emphasizing the crucial interdisciplinary perspectives required for a comprehensive understanding.  While traditionally analyzed through sociological lenses, a truly holistic perspective necessitates incorporating insights from political science, history, anthropology, and communication studies.  The presentation argues that successful social movements leverage diverse strategies, from collective action and mobilization (political science) to framing narratives and utilizing media effectively (communication studies), impacting long-term cultural shifts (anthropology) and reshaping political landscapes (political science).  Historical analysis (history) reveals both the successes and limitations of past movements, illustrating the complex interplay between agency and structure in achieving social transformation.  Furthermore, the presentation examines the increasingly important role of digital technologies in facilitating mobilization and communication within contemporary movements, highlighting both opportunities and challenges.  By integrating these interdisciplinary lenses, we can develop a more nuanced and robust understanding of social movements' contributions to societal progress and their enduring impact on human societies.
