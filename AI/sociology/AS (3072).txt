The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and historically contingent.  Early economic thought, exemplified by laissez-faire capitalism, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention, often neglecting social consequences. This resulted in periods of extreme wealth inequality and social unrest, as evidenced by the Industrial Revolution's stark disparities.  The subsequent rise of Keynesian economics shifted the focus, advocating for government intervention to manage aggregate demand and mitigate economic downturns, implicitly recognizing the social costs of unemployment and poverty.

However, the precise nature of this relationship remains debated.  While policies aimed at increasing employment, providing social safety nets (e.g., unemployment benefits, universal healthcare), and promoting equitable income distribution demonstrably improve well-being metrics like life expectancy and happiness,  the efficacy and potential trade-offs are context-specific.  For instance, expansive welfare states may impact economic growth, while prioritizing austerity measures can exacerbate social inequalities.  Therefore, understanding this dynamic necessitates analyzing the interplay of various economic policies within a given societal and historical context, acknowledging both intended and unintended consequences on diverse social outcomes.
