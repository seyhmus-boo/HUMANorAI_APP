The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being remains a central focus of economic and social research.  Recent developments highlight a shift away from solely GDP-centric assessments towards a more multidimensional understanding of well-being, encompassing factors like health, education, and environmental sustainability.  Studies increasingly employ  techniques such as the Human Development Index (HDI) and subjective well-being measures to capture the broader impact of economic policies.  While neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and privatization have been associated with increased income inequality in several countries, recent research suggests that targeted social safety nets and investments in human capital can mitigate negative social consequences.  Furthermore, the growing awareness of environmental externalities has led to a surge in research exploring the trade-offs between economic growth and ecological sustainability, with a rising focus on policies promoting green growth and circular economies.  The COVID-19 pandemic underscored the vulnerability of populations facing economic shocks and highlighted the critical role of social protection programs in bolstering resilience and well-being. Future research should focus on further refining the measurement of social well-being and developing evidence-based policy interventions that foster inclusive and sustainable economic growth.
