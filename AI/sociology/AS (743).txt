This research paper explores the societal ramifications of class inequality through the novel lens of quantum mechanics. While seemingly disparate fields, we posit that the principles governing quantum entanglement and superposition offer insightful analogies for understanding the interconnectedness and complex dynamics of social stratification.  Traditional sociological analyses often treat class as a discrete variable, neglecting the inherent uncertainty and probabilistic nature of individual trajectories within stratified systems.  We argue that a quantum-inspired approach, focusing on the entangled states of individuals and groups within the socioeconomic landscape, offers a richer understanding of the emergent properties of inequality. Specifically, we propose that the "wave function" of societal well-being can be significantly altered by class-based disparities, leading to observable societal "collapse" into states of increased polarization or instability.  This framework moves beyond deterministic models, acknowledging the probabilistic nature of individual mobility and the unpredictable consequences of seemingly small perturbations within the system.  Our analysis leverages concepts such as quantum superposition, to represent individuals' potential for upward or downward mobility, and quantum entanglement, to highlight the interconnectedness of individual fortunes and the systemic nature of inequality.  The subsequent sections will detail our theoretical framework and its implications for understanding and potentially mitigating the detrimental effects of class inequality.
