The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has long been a central theme in the social sciences, yet its nuances remain a subject of ongoing debate and empirical investigation.  This paper examines the multifaceted connections between macroeconomic strategies and societal outcomes, focusing on recent developments that challenge traditional economic paradigms.  The rise of inequality, despite periods of aggregate economic growth, necessitates a reevaluation of policies solely focused on GDP maximization.  Recent research highlights the limitations of relying solely on market mechanisms to ensure equitable distribution of resources and opportunities, prompting a renewed interest in social safety nets and interventionist policies.  Furthermore, the growing awareness of environmental sustainability has introduced a critical dimension to the discussion, demanding a shift towards policies that prioritize long-term societal well-being over short-term economic gains. This paper will explore these shifts, analysing the impact of recent policy innovations, such as universal basic income trials and green fiscal policies, on key indicators of social well-being including health, education, and environmental quality.  Ultimately, the paper aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how economic policies can be designed to effectively promote both economic prosperity and genuine social well-being.
