Education has historically played a pivotal role in shaping social norms, acting as both a reflector and a shaper of prevailing cultural values.  Early formal education systems, often tied to religious or elite institutions, reinforced existing hierarchies and transmitted specific societal expectations.  However, the rise of mass education in the 19th and 20th centuries brought about a shift, with schools increasingly tasked with socializing individuals into a broader national identity and promoting civic values. This entailed the standardized curriculum's dissemination of shared knowledge and narratives, influencing beliefs around gender roles, citizenship, and economic participation.  Contemporary research highlights the nuanced impact of education on norm internalization.  While formal curricula directly impart information, the hidden curriculum, encompassing school climate and social interactions, profoundly influences studentsâ€™ attitudes and behaviors.  Moreover, education's impact varies across contexts, depending on factors like socioeconomic status, cultural background, and the specific educational policies enacted. Future research should focus on disentangling the interplay between formal and informal learning environments to better understand how education cultivates both conformity and critical engagement with existing social norms.
