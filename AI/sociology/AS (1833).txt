Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, continues to exert profound and multifaceted effects on social structures and individual well-being.  This research paper examines the pervasive influence of class inequality across various societal domains, drawing upon an interdisciplinary framework that integrates sociological, economic, and psychological perspectives.  While economic disparities are central, we argue that a comprehensive understanding necessitates exploring the interconnectedness of economic stratification with social mobility, political participation, and individual health outcomes.  Sociological analyses of social reproduction and stratification will be integrated with economic models of wealth accumulation and distribution to illuminate the mechanisms perpetuating inequality.  Furthermore, psychological research on the impacts of socioeconomic status on cognitive development, stress, and mental health will be incorporated to provide a nuanced perspective on the individual-level consequences.  By adopting this interdisciplinary approach, this paper aims to move beyond a solely economic lens, offering a more holistic and nuanced understanding of the societal costs associated with class inequality and proposing potential avenues for mitigation.
