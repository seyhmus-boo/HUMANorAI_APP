This presentation examines the persistent issue of class inequality and its multifaceted societal consequences, tracing its historical roots and contemporary manifestations.  Historically, class stratification, though manifesting differently across eras and geographies (from feudal systems to industrial capitalism), has consistently generated significant social and economic disparities.  We will explore how the concentration of wealth and power in the hands of a minority has shaped political systems, impacting policy decisions related to healthcare, education, and social welfare.  The consequences of this inequality are demonstrably negative, leading to increased rates of poverty, crime, and poor health outcomes for marginalized groups.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the psychological impacts of inequality, including reduced social mobility and diminished opportunities for individual advancement, thereby perpetuating cycles of disadvantage across generations.  Using empirical data and sociological theory, we will argue that addressing class inequality requires a multi-pronged approach that tackles systemic issues within economic structures, educational systems, and political representation to promote a more just and equitable society.  The presentation will conclude by briefly outlining potential policy interventions and future research directions.
