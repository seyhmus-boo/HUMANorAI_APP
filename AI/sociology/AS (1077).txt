This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, focusing on the inherent experimental challenges in researching this complex phenomenon.  Existing literature often presents a dichotomous view: globalization as either homogenizing or diversifying.  We argue that this simplification obscures the nuanced and dynamic interplay between global and local forces.  Empirically capturing this dynamic requires methodological innovations beyond traditional quantitative or qualitative approaches.  The presentation will detail the challenges encountered in designing experiments to isolate the effects of specific globalization processes (e.g., media flows, migration) on culturally-specific practices and values.  We will discuss issues surrounding the operationalization of "culture" itself, the difficulties of establishing control groups in a globally interconnected world, and the ethical implications of manipulating cultural contexts for experimental purposes.  Finally, we propose a mixed-methods approach incorporating ethnographic observation, survey data, and natural experiments to offer a more robust understanding of the complex, often unpredictable, effects of globalization on local cultural landscapes.  We anticipate that this discussion will stimulate critical debate on methodological best practices in this vital area of research.
