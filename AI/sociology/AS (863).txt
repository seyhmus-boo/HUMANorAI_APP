The conventional understanding of the relationship between economic policies and social well-being relies primarily on classical and neoclassical economic models, often neglecting the inherent complexities and uncertainties inherent in human behavior and societal dynamics.  This paper proposes a novel approach, leveraging concepts from quantum mechanics to explore this relationship. We argue that the limitations of classical economic frameworks in predicting and explaining social outcomes stem from their deterministic nature, failing to adequately account for the probabilistic and interconnected nature of societal factors. Drawing analogies from quantum superposition and entanglement, we suggest that individual well-being, influenced by various economic policies, exists not in a single defined state, but rather as a superposition of potential states, determined by a complex interplay of factors.  Furthermore, the entanglement of individual well-being with collective social factors, such as inequality and access to resources, necessitates a move beyond individualistic perspectives.  This research aims to explore how quantum-inspired methodologies, focusing on probability distributions and interconnectedness, can provide a more nuanced understanding of the intricate relationship between economic policy choices and the multifaceted nature of social well-being, ultimately offering more robust and comprehensive policy recommendations.  Specifically, we will examine the implications of superposition and entanglement for modeling the impact of specific economic interventions on diverse social groups.
