Education's influence on societal norms is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate, with recent research illuminating its complex and multifaceted role. While traditional perspectives focused primarily on education's function in transmitting existing norms, contemporary scholarship increasingly emphasizes its capacity to challenge, reshape, and even create new social norms.  This paper examines this evolving understanding, focusing on how educational institutions and practices contribute to both the reproduction and transformation of societal expectations.  Recent advancements in social network analysis, for instance, have allowed researchers to better understand how educational settings facilitate the diffusion of both pro-social and counter-normative behaviors among students. Furthermore, the proliferation of online learning environments presents novel avenues for norm formation and transmission, necessitating a critical examination of their influence on broader social values.  Considering the rise of diverse learning methodologies and the increasing awareness of social justice issues within educational curricula, this paper argues that education serves as a dynamic and contested space where social norms are not merely passively absorbed but actively negotiated and redefined. We will explore specific examples of these processes to demonstrate the nuanced relationship between education and the evolution of societal norms.
