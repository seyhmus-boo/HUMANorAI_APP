This paper investigates the complex relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simplistic correlation to explore nuanced causal pathways.  We analyze a multi-faceted measure of social well-being incorporating health, education, environmental quality, and social inclusion, alongside a range of macroeconomic indicators representing fiscal, monetary, and regulatory policies. Utilizing panel data from OECD countries spanning two decades, we employ dynamic panel regression techniques to account for temporal dependencies and endogeneity. Our findings reveal a non-linear relationship, suggesting that the impact of economic policies on social well-being is contingent upon existing levels of social capital and inequality. While expansionary fiscal policies positively correlate with improvements in several well-being dimensions, particularly health and education, excessive reliance on austerity measures is associated with a significant decline in social inclusion and environmental quality.  Furthermore, regulatory policies focused on labor market protections and social safety nets demonstrate a strong positive association with overall well-being, even when controlling for economic growth.  These results underscore the need for policy interventions that prioritize both economic growth and equitable distribution of resources to foster sustainable and inclusive social well-being.
