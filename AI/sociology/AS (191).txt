This presentation examines the evolving role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on recent developments and emerging trends.  While traditional models emphasized collective action and resource mobilization, contemporary movements increasingly leverage digital technologies and networked communication to mobilize support, circumvent traditional power structures, and amplify marginalized voices.  This has led to a shift from geographically-bound activism to globally interconnected campaigns, as evidenced by the rapid dissemination of information and coordination of protests across international borders seen in recent climate and Black Lives Matter movements.  However,  the digital realm also presents challenges, including the spread of misinformation, algorithmic manipulation, and the potential for online echo chambers to reinforce existing biases.  This presentation will analyze the interplay between online and offline strategies, exploring how movements navigate these complexities to achieve their objectives.  Furthermore, it will discuss the evolving relationship between social movements and institutional actors, examining instances of both cooperation and conflict in achieving policy changes and broader societal transformation.  Finally, the presentation will offer insights into the long-term impacts and sustainability of these digitally-mediated movements.
