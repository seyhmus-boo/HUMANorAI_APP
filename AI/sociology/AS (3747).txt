This presentation explores the evolving landscape of gender roles in contemporary societies, drawing upon insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics.  We move beyond simplistic binary models to examine the complex interplay of factors shaping gendered expectations and behaviors.  The presentation will first trace the historical trajectory of gender roles, highlighting the significant shifts witnessed in the past century, particularly concerning women's participation in the workforce and education.  Subsequently, we will analyze the persistence of traditional gender ideologies alongside emerging forms of gender fluidity and non-binary identities.  An interdisciplinary approach is crucial here, as economic structures influence access to resources and opportunities, shaping gendered power dynamics, while psychological research reveals the internalization of societal norms and the impact on individual identities.  Anthropological perspectives further illuminate the diversity of gender expression across cultures, challenging universalized notions of masculinity and femininity.  Finally, we will discuss the ongoing challenges and future directions of research in this field, acknowledging the complexities of achieving true gender equality in a rapidly changing world.
