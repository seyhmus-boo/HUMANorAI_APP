Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies throughout history, continues to pose significant challenges to social cohesion and economic progress.  While its manifestations have varied across time and geographical location – from ancient slave societies to feudal systems and modern capitalist economies – the fundamental disparity in access to resources, opportunities, and power remains a central theme.  Historically, rigid social hierarchies, often justified by religious or ideological doctrines, reinforced class divisions, limiting social mobility and perpetuating cycles of poverty and disadvantage.  The Industrial Revolution, while fostering unprecedented economic growth, also exacerbated class disparities, creating a stark divide between the burgeoning industrial bourgeoisie and the marginalized working class.  This period witnessed the rise of socialist and Marxist critiques, highlighting the exploitative nature of capitalism and advocating for more equitable distribution of wealth and power.  Contemporary societies, while ostensibly more egalitarian, still grapple with significant class inequalities manifested in disparities in income, wealth, education, healthcare, and political influence.  This paper will examine the multifaceted effects of class inequality on various societal aspects, exploring its impact on social mobility, health outcomes, political participation, and overall societal stability.
