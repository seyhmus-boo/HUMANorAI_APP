This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, tracing its evolution from early online communities to the pervasive platforms of today.  Historically, human interaction relied on geographically proximate networks, limiting the scale and speed of information dissemination. The advent of the internet and subsequently social media fundamentally altered this landscape, creating globally interconnected communities.  We will examine the demonstrable effects of this shift, focusing on several key areas: the impact on social connection and relationships, analyzing the rise of online communities alongside the potential for social isolation and polarization; the influence on self-perception and identity formation, considering the curated nature of online personas and the impact on body image and self-esteem; and finally, the role of social media in shaping political attitudes and behaviors, addressing the spread of misinformation and the amplification of existing biases.  The presentation will draw upon existing literature in sociology, psychology, and communication studies to illustrate the complex and often contradictory effects of social media, highlighting both its positive contributions to social mobilization and its potential for negative consequences on individual well-being and societal cohesion.  The concluding remarks will offer avenues for future research into mitigating negative impacts and harnessing the beneficial aspects of these powerful technological tools.
