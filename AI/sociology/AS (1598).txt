This presentation examines the evolving role of education in shaping social norms, focusing on recent developments in pedagogy and societal understanding.  While traditional education has always implicitly transmitted cultural values, contemporary research highlights its increasingly proactive role in fostering positive social change.  We will explore how advancements in social-emotional learning (SEL) curricula, coupled with a growing emphasis on inclusive and equitable pedagogical practices, are actively challenging harmful norms.  Recent studies demonstrate a correlation between effective SEL interventions and reduced rates of bullying, improved intergroup relations, and increased civic engagement among students.  Furthermore, the integration of critical thinking skills and media literacy into educational frameworks empowers learners to critically analyze prevalent social norms and actively participate in their transformation.  This presentation will analyze these developments, considering both the successes and challenges inherent in using education as a tool for social norm change, including issues of curriculum implementation, teacher training, and the potential for unintended consequences.  Ultimately, we argue that a holistic approach, encompassing both cognitive and affective learning, is crucial for education to effectively contribute to the creation of more just and equitable societies.
