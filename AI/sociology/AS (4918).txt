Social movements, like powerful geological forces, shape the contours of society over time.  This presentation explores their multifaceted role in driving societal change, drawing upon compelling analogies to illuminate their mechanisms and impact.  We posit that movements, akin to rivers carving canyons, gradually erode entrenched power structures and norms through persistent pressure and mobilization.  Their success, however, isn't solely determined by their force, but also by the permeability of the societal "rock" they encounter.  A rigid, authoritarian regime acts as impermeable bedrock, resisting even the strongest currents of change. Conversely, a more flexible societal landscape, like sedimentary rock, is more susceptible to reshaping by the cumulative effects of movement activity.  Furthermore, the effectiveness of a movement can be compared to a wildfire: a rapid spread of influence is crucial for initial success, but sustained mobilization, analogous to controlled burns for forest management, is vital for lasting change and preventing resurgence of the old order.  We will analyze case studies illustrating these dynamics, demonstrating the interplay between movement strategies, societal receptivity, and the ultimate extent of societal transformation.  The presentation concludes by suggesting avenues for future research focusing on the dynamic interaction between movement agency and structural constraints.
