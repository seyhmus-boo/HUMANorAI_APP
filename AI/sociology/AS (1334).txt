This paper examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simplistic correlation to explore nuanced causal pathways and mediating factors.  While economic growth is often posited as a prerequisite for improved social well-being, the impact is contingent upon the distributional effects of chosen policies.  Neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and market liberalization, while potentially stimulating GDP, may exacerbate inequality and undermine social cohesion, ultimately hindering overall well-being as measured by indices incorporating health, education, and social support.  Conversely, social democratic policies prioritizing social safety nets, robust public services, and equitable income distribution demonstrably correlate with higher levels of social well-being, even if associated with slower GDP growth in certain contexts.  The paper argues that a comprehensive assessment necessitates considering both macroeconomic indicators and qualitative measures of well-being, acknowledging the crucial role of policy design in shaping societal outcomes.  Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated econometric models that account for the complex interactions between economic variables and diverse dimensions of social well-being, moving beyond simple aggregate measures.
