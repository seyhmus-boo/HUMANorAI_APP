This presentation examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, focusing on recent developments that challenge traditional neo-liberal assumptions.  While economic growth has long been considered a primary driver of improved social outcomes,  recent empirical evidence suggests a more nuanced and often decoupled relationship.  We will analyze how specific policy choices – including austerity measures, minimum wage policies, and social safety net programs – impact key indicators of well-being, such as health, education, and inequality.  The rise of  "doughnut economics" and similar frameworks highlighting planetary boundaries underscores the limitations of solely GDP-focused approaches.  Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic exposed the fragility of social safety nets in many advanced economies, highlighting the urgent need for more resilient and inclusive economic models. This presentation will discuss the implications of these findings for policymakers, emphasizing the crucial need to integrate social well-being metrics into economic policy design and evaluation. We will explore the potential for alternative policy approaches that prioritize both economic efficiency and social justice, leading to a more sustainable and equitable future.
