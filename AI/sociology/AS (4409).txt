The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a cornerstone of contemporary economics.  Historically, a focus on GDP growth often overshadowed broader societal impacts.  However, recent developments highlight a shift towards more holistic approaches.  The limitations of purely growth-oriented policies are increasingly acknowledged, particularly in light of rising inequality and environmental concerns.

Recent research emphasizes the importance of inclusive growth, prioritizing equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities alongside economic expansion.  Policies like universal basic income and targeted social safety nets are gaining traction, aiming to mitigate poverty and improve overall societal well-being.  Furthermore, the growing awareness of the social cost of carbon is prompting the integration of environmental sustainability into economic planning, recognizing the interconnectedness of environmental health and human well-being.  This necessitates a move beyond traditional macroeconomic indicators to incorporate measures of social progress, such as happiness indices and inequality metrics, for a more comprehensive assessment of policy effectiveness.  Ultimately, the pursuit of robust social well-being demands a paradigm shift towards policies that prioritize both economic prosperity and social justice.
