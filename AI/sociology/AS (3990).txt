Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies throughout history, manifests as a hierarchical stratification based on economic resources, social status, and political power.  Historical examples, from ancient Roman society with its patrician and plebeian classes to the feudal systems of medieval Europe with their rigid distinctions between nobility, clergy, and peasantry, demonstrate the enduring presence of this societal division.  While the specific mechanisms and markers of class have evolved, the fundamental disparity in access to resources and opportunities remains. This inequality has profound consequences for society, impacting health outcomes, educational attainment, and life expectancy.  Individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds often experience higher rates of morbidity and mortality, limited access to quality education, and reduced social mobility, perpetuating the cycle of poverty and disadvantage.  Furthermore, extreme class inequality can fuel social unrest, political instability, and erode social cohesion, undermining the legitimacy of governing institutions and fostering resentment among marginalized groups.  Addressing this complex issue requires multifaceted approaches that tackle both its root causes and its multifaceted consequences.
