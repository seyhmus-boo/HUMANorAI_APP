This presentation explores the role of education in shaping social norms through a novel lens: the principles of quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate, quantum phenomena offer intriguing parallels to the complex, probabilistic nature of societal change.  We propose that education, akin to a quantum measurement, collapses the superposition of possible social norms into a more defined state.  Individual learning experiences – the "observations" – act as decoherence processes, influencing the probability of adopting specific norms.  The presentation will argue that curricula and pedagogical approaches function as potential "Hamiltonians," directing the evolution of societal norms by influencing the probabilities of different behavioral outcomes.  Furthermore, we will examine the role of social interaction as entanglement, where the norms adopted by individuals become interconnected and influence the overall societal wave function.  This framework offers a richer understanding of the multifaceted process of norm formation, suggesting that education's impact isn't merely deterministic, but probabilistic and fundamentally intertwined with the complex quantum-like dynamics of social systems. Finally, we will discuss implications for educational policy and the design of interventions aimed at promoting positive social change through deliberate manipulation of this "societal wave function."
