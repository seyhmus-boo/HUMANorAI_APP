Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the persistent issue of class inequality and its societal ramifications, focusing on recent developments.  While class structures have always existed, contemporary inequalities exhibit concerning trends amplified by globalization and technological advancements.  

The widening gap between the wealthiest percentile and the rest of the population is demonstrably linked to diminished social mobility.  This limits opportunities for upward progression, perpetuating cycles of poverty and hindering individual potential.  Furthermore, increased wealth concentration contributes to political polarization, as the affluent exert disproportionate influence on policy-making, often to the detriment of the less privileged.  

Recent research highlights the deleterious effects on public health, with lower socioeconomic groups experiencing higher rates of chronic illness and shorter lifespans.  Furthermore, rising inequality correlates with increased crime rates and social unrest.  Addressing this complex issue requires multifaceted strategies including progressive taxation, investment in education and social safety nets, and policies promoting fair labor practices.  Failure to do so risks exacerbating societal divisions and undermining the very fabric of a just and equitable society.
