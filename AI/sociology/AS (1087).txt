Good morning. Today's lecture examines class inequality and its multifaceted societal repercussions.  Class, understood not merely as economic stratification but as a complex interplay of economic capital, social capital, and cultural capital (Bourdieu), significantly shapes individual life chances.  High levels of inequality demonstrably correlate with poorer health outcomes (epidemiology), as evidenced by increased mortality rates and reduced life expectancy amongst lower socioeconomic groups.  Furthermore, economic disparity fuels social unrest and political instability (political science), manifesting in higher crime rates (criminology) and reduced social cohesion (sociology).  Education, a key mechanism for social mobility, is itself impacted by class, with unequal access to quality education perpetuating the cycle of inequality across generations (education studies).  Consequently, addressing class inequality necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from economics, sociology, political science, public health, and education to formulate effective and holistic policy interventions.  Only through such a collaborative effort can we hope to mitigate the pervasive and damaging effects of class inequality on our societies.
