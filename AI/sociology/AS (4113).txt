Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and perpetuating social norms, acting as both a reflector and a reformer of societal values.  Traditionally, educational institutions reinforced existing norms through curriculum and pedagogy, subtly transmitting cultural expectations and hierarchies.  However, recent developments showcase a shift in this dynamic.

The rise of critical pedagogy challenges traditional power structures embedded within educational systems.  This approach encourages students to critically analyze prevailing norms, fostering awareness of social injustices and inequalities often embedded within seemingly neutral practices.  Furthermore, advancements in technology, particularly the accessibility of diverse perspectives online, have broadened the scope of educational influence beyond the confines of the classroom.  Students are now exposed to a globalized discourse, questioning and reshaping existing norms through online activism and the dissemination of counter-narratives.  While the efficacy of these developments in altering entrenched social norms remains a subject of ongoing research, it's clear education's role is evolving from mere transmission to active negotiation of societal values.
