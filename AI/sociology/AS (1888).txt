This abstract explores the nascent field of applying quantum mechanical concepts to understand the complex relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  Traditional macroeconomic models often fail to capture the emergent properties of social systems, characterized by non-linearity and entanglement of individual and collective behaviors.  We propose a framework leveraging concepts from quantum field theory, where individual agents are represented as quasiparticles interacting within a socio-economic field.  Economic policies act as external potentials influencing the dynamics of this field, affecting the collective wave function representing the overall social well-being.  This approach allows for modeling emergent phenomena like inequality (represented by wave function decoherence) and social instability (expressed through phase transitions).  We posit that optimal economic policies correspond to those that minimize decoherence, maximize entanglement within desired social structures (e.g., cooperative networks), and steer the system towards a ground state of high social well-being.  Further research will focus on developing specific quantitative models and testing the predictive power of this framework, potentially utilizing tools from quantum simulation and machine learning to analyze large-scale socio-economic datasets.  This novel approach promises a deeper understanding of complex social dynamics and the impact of policy interventions.
