This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a narrow focus on purely economic indicators often overlooks crucial aspects of societal health. We posit that effective policymaking requires a holistic approach, integrating economic growth with social justice and environmental sustainability.  The presentation will analyze various policy instruments – including taxation, social safety nets, and investment in human capital – and their impact on key indicators of social well-being, such as health outcomes, education levels, and income inequality.  We will examine empirical evidence showcasing how different policy choices lead to divergent societal outcomes, highlighting instances where prioritizing economic growth at the expense of social equity has resulted in negative consequences.  Conversely, we will showcase examples where proactive social policies have fostered inclusive growth and improved overall societal well-being.  Practical applications will be discussed, focusing on policy recommendations for governments aiming to achieve a more balanced and equitable approach to economic development.  These include targeted interventions addressing specific social vulnerabilities and the implementation of robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks to ensure policy effectiveness and accountability.  Ultimately, this presentation advocates for a paradigm shift towards a more integrated and socially conscious approach to economic policymaking.
