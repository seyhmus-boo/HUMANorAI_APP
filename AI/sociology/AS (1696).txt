Cultural diversity, like a complex ecosystem, fosters both competition and collaboration.  This study examines the multifaceted influence of cultural diversity on social integration, drawing analogies from ecological and biological principles.  High levels of cultural diversity, akin to a highly biodiverse ecosystem, can initially lead to fragmentation and niche competition, manifesting as social segregation and intergroup conflict.  However, sufficient structural mechanisms, analogous to keystone species in an ecosystem, such as inclusive policies and intercultural programs, can facilitate positive interactions.  These mechanisms promote resource sharing and synergistic effects, equivalent to symbiotic relationships within an ecosystem, leading to enhanced social cohesion and innovation.  Our analysis reveals that the relationship is not linear; the impact of diversity on integration depends critically on the presence and effectiveness of such mediating factors.  A lack of these integrating mechanisms can result in a "tragedy of the commons" scenario, where competition for limited resources overwhelms collaborative potential, hindering social integration.  Further research should focus on identifying optimal levels of diversity and effective strategies for promoting positive intergroup relations within diverse societies.
