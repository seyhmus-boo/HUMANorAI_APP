This abstract proposes a novel framework for understanding the impact of social media on human behavior through the lens of quantum mechanics.  While classical models struggle to fully capture the probabilistic and context-dependent nature of human decision-making influenced by social media, a quantum-like approach offers a potentially more accurate representation. We hypothesize that the superposition of multiple behavioral states – reflecting the simultaneous consideration of various online influences – collapses upon action, resulting in observable choices.  Social media algorithms, akin to measurement apparatuses, may influence the probability of specific state collapses by selectively amplifying certain stimuli (e.g., likes, comments, trending hashtags). This "quantum measurement problem" analogy suggests that the perceived objectivity of online interactions is an illusion, with the algorithm actively shaping the observable behavioral outcomes.  Furthermore, entanglement between individual user profiles and network structures could be modeled to explore the spread of information and the formation of echo chambers, thereby impacting collective behavior.  Future research will focus on developing quantitative models incorporating quantum formalism to analyze large-scale social media datasets, testing the validity of this proposed quantum-like framework and its implications for behavioral prediction and intervention strategies.
