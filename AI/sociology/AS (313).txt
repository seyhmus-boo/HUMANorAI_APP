Social integration, the process by which individuals become cohesive members of a larger society, is increasingly complex in the context of rising global migration and cultural diversification. This research paper explores the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, acknowledging the limitations of a solely sociological approach.  We argue that a robust understanding necessitates an interdisciplinary framework, drawing upon insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and political science.  While sociological studies extensively examine the impact of ethnic and racial diversity on social cohesion,  anthropological perspectives offer valuable insights into cultural practices and their role in fostering or hindering integration.  Psychological research illuminates the cognitive and emotional processes underlying prejudice and intergroup relations, while political science contributes an understanding of the policy frameworks influencing social inclusion and exclusion. This paper, therefore, synthesizes these perspectives to investigate how diverse cultural backgrounds affect social integration outcomes.  Specifically, we will examine the mediating roles of intercultural communication, social capital, and institutional responsiveness in shaping the relationship between cultural diversity and successful integration within diverse societal contexts.
