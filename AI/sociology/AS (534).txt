Education plays a crucial role in shaping and reinforcing societal norms, acting as both a transmitter of existing values and a catalyst for social change. This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between education and social norms, examining how formal and informal educational settings influence individual beliefs and behaviors.  We analyze the curriculum's role in explicitly teaching societal expectations and values, focusing on the transmission of norms related to gender, ethnicity, and civic engagement.  Furthermore, the presentation investigates the hidden curriculum – implicit lessons learned through school structure and social interactions – and its impact on the internalization of social norms.  We discuss how educational institutions can both perpetuate existing inequalities and contribute to social progress through pedagogical approaches promoting critical thinking, empathy, and intercultural understanding. The implications of this analysis for curriculum development, teacher training, and social policy aimed at fostering positive social change are explored.  Empirical evidence from relevant sociological and educational research will be presented to support the arguments, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between education and the evolution of social norms.
