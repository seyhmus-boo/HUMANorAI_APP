The profound influence of education on societal structures is a subject of ongoing scholarly debate.  This paper examines the critical role education plays in shaping and perpetuating social norms, extending beyond the simple transmission of knowledge to encompass the formation of values, beliefs, and behaviours. Historically, educational systems have served as powerful tools for both social cohesion and control.  From ancient Greece, where education fostered civic virtue and adherence to the polis's norms, to the more recent rise of mass education in the 19th and 20th centuries, intentional and unintentional socialization has been a key function.  Nation-building projects frequently leveraged education to instill national identity and loyalty, often accompanied by the promotion of specific cultural norms and values.  Conversely, critiques of education's role have highlighted its potential to reinforce existing inequalities and perpetuate harmful social norms, such as gender stereotypes or racial biases, through curriculum content, pedagogical approaches, and even the very structure of educational institutions.  This research will explore this complex interplay, analysing how educational structures, curricula, and pedagogical practices actively contribute to both the reproduction and transformation of social norms within specific historical and contemporary contexts.
