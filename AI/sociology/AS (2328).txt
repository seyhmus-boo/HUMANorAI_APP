The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, posing significant challenges for experimental investigation.  While economic indicators like GDP growth often serve as proxies for societal progress, they inadequately capture the nuances of well-being, encompassing factors such as health, education, and social cohesion.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a gold standard in causal inference, face limitations when applied to macroeconomic policies.  The scale and long-term nature of these interventions make controlled experiments difficult, introducing ethical considerations and challenges in isolating policy effects from confounding factors.  Furthermore, the heterogeneity of populations and the interplay between numerous policies complicate the identification of specific causal pathways.  Measuring the subjective aspects of well-being, such as happiness or life satisfaction, introduces further complexities, raising questions of validity and comparability across different contexts.  Consequently, robust conclusions regarding the impact of economic policies on social well-being often require a multi-method approach, integrating quantitative data with qualitative insights and acknowledging the inherent limitations of experimental design within this complex domain.
