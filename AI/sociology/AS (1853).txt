Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, characterized by both homogenization and hybridity. This review examines existing literature exploring this dynamic interplay. While globalization facilitates cultural exchange and diffusion, leading to the adoption of global trends in consumption, media, and lifestyle, evidence suggests a significant risk of cultural homogenization, potentially marginalizing or even eroding unique local traditions and practices.  However,  a counter-narrative emphasizes the resilience and adaptability of local cultures.  Studies highlight the emergence of hybrid cultural forms, demonstrating the capacity of local cultures to selectively incorporate global influences while retaining core values and identities. This process often results in a negotiated synthesis, where global elements are reinterpreted and integrated into existing cultural frameworks.  The extent of globalization's impact varies considerably depending on factors such as the scale of global influence, the pre-existing strength of local cultural institutions, and the agency of local communities in shaping the process of cultural change.  Future research should focus on nuanced case studies examining the agency of local actors and the long-term sustainability of hybridized cultural forms.
