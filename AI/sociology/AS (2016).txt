Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have profoundly shaped societies throughout history.  From the abolitionist movement to the civil rights movement, their impact on societal norms, laws, and institutions is undeniable.  However, rigorously establishing a causal link between social movement activity and subsequent societal change remains a significant challenge for social science research.  This paper explores the methodological hurdles inherent in studying this complex relationship, focusing on the difficulties of designing robust experimental interventions.  The inherent unpredictability of social movements, their embeddedness within pre-existing social structures, and the ethical considerations surrounding manipulation make controlled experiments exceedingly difficult to implement.  We examine existing approaches, including natural experiments leveraging exogenous shocks or quasi-experimental designs exploiting variations in movement activity across geographically defined units.  The paper further assesses the limitations of these methods, highlighting the biases inherent in observational data and the challenges of isolating the impact of social movements from other confounding factors.  Ultimately, we argue that a multi-method approach, integrating quantitative and qualitative techniques, is essential to advance our understanding of social movements' role in driving societal transformation.
