This paper investigates the complex and multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  While economic growth is often cited as a primary objective of government policy, its impact on societal well-being is neither uniform nor automatically positive.  This research explores the mediating factors that influence this relationship, focusing specifically on the distributional effects of economic policies and their impact on key indicators of social well-being, including health, education, and social inclusion.  We examine a range of economic policy instruments, such as taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulations, analyzing their effects on various demographic groups and assessing the extent to which they contribute to or detract from societal well-being.  The study employs a comparative framework, drawing on both theoretical models and empirical evidence from diverse national contexts to identify potential causal mechanisms and highlight the trade-offs inherent in policy choices. Ultimately, this paper seeks to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the links between economic policies and social well-being, offering insights for policymakers aiming to achieve more equitable and sustainable societal outcomes.
