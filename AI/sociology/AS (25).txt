Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, continues to exert a profound influence on social structures and individual life chances.  While the precise mechanisms and manifestations vary across contexts, recent developments underscore the enduring and potentially exacerbating nature of this societal challenge.  This paper examines the multifaceted effects of class inequality on contemporary society, moving beyond traditional analyses of income disparity to encompass a broader understanding of its impact on health, education, political participation, and social mobility.

Recent research highlights a growing concentration of wealth at the top of the income distribution, coupled with stagnant or declining wages for a significant portion of the population in many developed nations. This trend, amplified by technological advancements and globalization, has fuelled concerns about increased social stratification and diminished opportunities for upward mobility.  Furthermore,  emerging scholarship emphasizes the insidious effects of class inequality on social cohesion, manifested in heightened levels of social unrest, political polarization, and erosion of social trust.  This paper will explore these developments, critically analyzing existing literature and proposing avenues for future research aimed at mitigating the detrimental consequences of persistent class disparities.
