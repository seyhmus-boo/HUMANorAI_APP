Good morning. Today's lecture explores class inequality through a novel lens: quantum mechanics. While seemingly disparate, the principles of superposition and entanglement offer intriguing parallels.  Consider societal stratification as a superposition of potential outcomes – each individual exists in a probabilistic state across various socioeconomic positions. However, unlike a quantum system collapsing upon observation, societal class largely remains a persistent, if fluctuating, superposition influenced by systemic "measurement" –  processes like education, inheritance, and employment opportunities.

These processes, however, are not uniformly applied.  Entanglement arises: an individual's socioeconomic state becomes entangled with the states of others, creating complex correlations across the entire societal wave function.  Significant class inequality represents an unbalanced system, an uneven distribution of resources akin to an unbalanced superposition prone to societal "decoherence." This manifests as social instability, decreased overall societal well-being, and the restriction of potential – a vast untapped reservoir of human capital trapped in unfavorable socioeconomic eigenstates.  Addressing this necessitates carefully designed interventions – policy adjustments acting as controlled "measurements" that aim to collapse the societal superposition into a more equitable and stable configuration.  Thank you.
