The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being presents significant challenges for empirical investigation. While intuitively, policies aiming to stimulate economic growth should improve societal well-being, establishing a causal link proves remarkably difficult.  Firstly, the multifaceted nature of well-being itself poses a challenge.  Measuring well-being requires considering diverse factors, from income inequality and health outcomes to subjective happiness and social cohesion, each with its own methodological complexities.  Secondly, isolating the effects of specific economic policies from confounding variables is exceptionally challenging.  External shocks, simultaneous policy changes, and inherent regional variations introduce significant noise into the data, hindering accurate causal inference.  Experimental approaches, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), offer a powerful methodology but face practical limitations. Implementing large-scale RCTs on macroeconomic policies is often infeasible due to ethical concerns, political constraints, and the sheer scale of required resources.  Consequently, researchers often rely on quasi-experimental designs, introducing further challenges related to the validity of causal claims.
