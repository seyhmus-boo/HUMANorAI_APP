This abstract explores the societal impact of class inequality through a novel lens: the quantum mechanical concept of entanglement.  We propose a conceptual framework where socio-economic strata are analogous to entangled quantum states, exhibiting non-local correlations.  Extreme class inequality, represented by a high degree of entanglement between vastly disparate states (e.g., extreme wealth and extreme poverty), leads to system-wide instability. This instability manifests as societal unrest, reflected in increased variance in societal metrics such as health outcomes, educational attainment, and crime rates.  We posit that the "measurement" of class – through social policies, for example – influences the observable state of the system, potentially leading to decoherence and a reduction in overall societal well-being if measurements are poorly designed or implemented.  Further, a high degree of entanglement can hinder the system's ability to adapt to change, resembling a fragile, easily disrupted quantum superposition.  Reducing inequality, analogous to disentanglement, promotes a more stable and robust societal state, characterized by greater resilience and reduced susceptibility to systemic shocks.  Future research will focus on developing quantitative models to explore the dynamics of this proposed "socio-economic entanglement" and its implications for policy interventions.
