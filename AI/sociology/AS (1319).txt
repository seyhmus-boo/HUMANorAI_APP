Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have profoundly shaped societal trajectories throughout history.  From the abolitionist movement dismantling slavery to the suffragette movement securing women's suffrage, their impact on societal change is undeniable.  Early scholarship, often focused on resource mobilization and political opportunity structures, emphasized the strategic mobilization of resources and the presence of favourable political contexts as key determinants of success.  However, more recent approaches, incorporating framing theory and identity politics, highlight the crucial role of collective identity formation and the construction of compelling narratives in galvanizing support and achieving mobilization.

The success of a social movement is contingent upon several factors including the framing of grievances, the ability to build effective organizational structures, and the strategic utilization of various tactics, ranging from peaceful protests to civil disobedience.  Moreover, the interaction between social movements and the state is crucial; repressive responses can escalate conflict, while concessions can lead to institutional change. Ultimately, the impact of social movements varies considerably, resulting in either incremental adjustments or transformative shifts in power structures and social norms, underscoring the complex interplay of agency and structure in the process of societal transformation.
