Class inequality, characterized by the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across societal strata, exerts profound and multifaceted effects on societal well-being. This paper theoretically explores the causal mechanisms linking class stratification to negative social outcomes.  Firstly, unequal access to quality education, healthcare, and housing limits social mobility, perpetuating intergenerational poverty and hindering individual potential.  Secondly, economic disparities foster social fragmentation, increasing crime rates and social unrest as marginalized groups experience relative deprivation.  Thirdly, concentrated power in the hands of the elite can lead to policy biases favoring the wealthy, further exacerbating inequality and undermining democratic principles.  Finally, the pervasive stress associated with socioeconomic disadvantage contributes to higher rates of mental and physical health problems across affected populations.  Addressing class inequality requires multi-pronged interventions targeting resource redistribution, educational reform, and policies promoting inclusive growth to mitigate these detrimental societal effects and foster a more equitable and just society.
