This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simplistic correlation to examine the nuanced pathways through which policy choices impact societal outcomes. We argue that a purely growth-focused approach inadequately captures the multifaceted nature of well-being, necessitating a broader framework that incorporates dimensions like health, education, and environmental sustainability.  The presentation will analyze various policy instruments – including taxation, social welfare programs, and environmental regulations – and their differential impacts on diverse population segments, highlighting potential trade-offs and synergies.  Practical applications will be illustrated through case studies examining the effectiveness of conditional cash transfer programs in poverty reduction, the influence of minimum wage legislation on income inequality, and the impact of carbon pricing mechanisms on both economic growth and environmental quality.  The ultimate aim is to demonstrate that a holistic approach to policymaking, integrating economic considerations with a robust understanding of social well-being indicators, is crucial for achieving sustainable and equitable development.  This requires moving beyond GDP as a sole metric of success and embracing a more multidimensional perspective to inform effective policy design and evaluation.
