This presentation explores the role of education in shaping social norms through the lens of quantum mechanics, specifically focusing on the concept of superposition and wave function collapse. We argue that individuals, before formal education, exist in a superposition of potential social behaviors, a probabilistic landscape of possible norms.  Education acts as a measurement apparatus, collapsing this superposition.  The curriculum, pedagogical methods, and social environment of the educational institution influence the probability amplitude of specific norms, effectively steering the "collapse" towards certain socially acceptable behaviors.  This process isn't deterministic; inherent randomness and individual experiences still play a role. However, the educational environment biases the outcome, amplifying the probability of certain social norms becoming entrenched.  Furthermore, we propose that the interconnectedness of students within the educational system can be analogized to entangled quantum states, whereby the influence of one individual's norm adoption impacts others, creating a cascading effect on the overall societal norms of a cohort.  This framework provides a novel perspective on how education, beyond the simple transmission of knowledge, actively constructs and reinforces societal values and behaviors. We conclude by discussing implications for educational policy and future research directions.
