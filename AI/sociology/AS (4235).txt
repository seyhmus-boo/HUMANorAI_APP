This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, moving beyond simplistic narratives of homogenization or hybridization.  Historically, cultural exchange has always existed, but globalization, accelerated by technological advancements and economic liberalization from the late 20th century, presents a novel scale and intensity.  We will trace the evolution of globalization's influence, from early colonial encounters which forcefully imposed dominant cultures, to the current era characterized by increased interconnectedness through media, migration, and transnational corporations.  The presentation will argue that globalization's effects are neither uniform nor unidirectional.  While cultural appropriation and the erosion of traditional practices are demonstrable consequences, we will also highlight instances of cultural resilience and adaptation, showcasing how local cultures actively negotiate and reinterpret global influences. This includes examining the rise of glocalization – the adaptation of global products and ideas to local contexts – and the role of digital media in both challenging and preserving cultural identities.  Ultimately, the presentation aims to foster a nuanced understanding of the complex and dynamic interplay between globalization and local cultures.
