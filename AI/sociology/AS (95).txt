This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in studying the causal impact of social movements on societal change.  While social movements are widely recognized as drivers of significant societal transformations, rigorously establishing their causal role remains a significant methodological hurdle.  Traditional observational studies are hampered by endogeneity:  movements often emerge in response to pre-existing societal pressures, confounding the identification of their independent effect.  Furthermore, the multifaceted nature of social movements, involving diverse actors and strategies, complicates the isolation of specific causal mechanisms.

This presentation will discuss several experimental approaches aiming to address these challenges.  We will explore the potential of natural experiments, leveraging exogenous shocks affecting movement mobilization, and the limitations of such approaches, including the difficulty in replicating findings across diverse contexts.  Furthermore, we will examine the applicability of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in this area, acknowledging the ethical and practical constraints of manipulating social movement activity.  Finally, we will discuss the potential of mixed-methods approaches, integrating quantitative data with qualitative insights from participant observation and ethnographic research, to offer a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between social movements and societal change.  The presentation concludes by highlighting future research directions that prioritize methodological rigor while retaining a focus on the lived experiences shaping movement dynamics.
