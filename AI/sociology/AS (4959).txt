Class inequality, a persistent societal feature throughout history, refers to the unequal distribution of resources, power, and opportunities based on social class.  Historically, feudal systems entrenched inequality through hereditary hierarchies, while industrialization fostered a new class structure characterized by a capitalist bourgeoisie and a proletarian working class, marked by stark disparities in wealth and living conditions.  Marxist theory posits that this inherent conflict drives social change, while Weberian perspectives emphasize the interplay of class, status, and power in shaping inequality.

The consequences of class inequality are multifaceted.  High levels of inequality correlate with decreased social mobility, limiting individuals' life chances based on their birth circumstances. This fosters social instability, manifesting as higher crime rates, political polarization, and diminished social cohesion.  Further, unequal access to healthcare, education, and other vital resources exacerbates health disparities and reinforces intergenerational poverty.  Ultimately, significant class inequality undermines a society's potential for equitable growth and collective well-being, hindering its overall development and stability.
