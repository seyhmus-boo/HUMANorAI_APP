This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a purely growth-focused approach is insufficient for achieving genuine societal progress.  We posit that effective economic policies must explicitly consider their social impact, moving beyond narrow macroeconomic indicators to encompass broader measures of well-being such as health, education, and social inclusion.  The analysis will examine how different policy instruments – including taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulations – differentially affect various social groups, highlighting potential disparities and inequalities.  We will present case studies illustrating the practical applications of this framework, focusing on the contrasting outcomes of policies prioritizing austerity versus those prioritizing social investment in nations such as Scandinavia and Southern Europe.  The presentation will conclude by emphasizing the importance of evidence-based policymaking, advocating for the integration of social well-being indicators into economic planning and evaluation processes.  This necessitates a shift towards a more holistic approach, recognizing that economic growth is a means to an end, not an end in itself, and that sustained social well-being is crucial for long-term economic prosperity and stability.
