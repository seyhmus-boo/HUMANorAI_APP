This presentation examines the ongoing evolution of gender roles within contemporary societies, moving beyond simplistic notions of progress towards a nuanced understanding of persistent inequalities and emerging complexities.  We analyze the interplay of socio-economic factors, cultural shifts, and technological advancements in shaping contemporary gender dynamics.  While significant strides have been made in areas such as legal equality and increased female participation in the workforce,  the presentation argues that these gains are unevenly distributed geographically and across social strata.  We explore the persistence of gendered divisions of labor within the household, the enduring gender pay gap, and the continued underrepresentation of women in leadership positions.  Furthermore, we consider the impact of globalization and digital technologies on the reinforcement and renegotiation of gender norms, analyzing the emergence of new forms of gendered inequality online and in the gig economy.  The presentation concludes by highlighting the need for interdisciplinary approaches to address the complex and multifaceted challenges of achieving genuine gender equality in the 21st century, considering both material conditions and the deeply ingrained cultural beliefs that shape gendered experiences.
