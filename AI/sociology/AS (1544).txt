The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, posing significant challenges for experimental investigation. While seemingly straightforward – effective economic policies should enhance social well-being – disentangling causality is fraught with difficulty.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard in causal inference, often face limitations in this context.  Ethical concerns frequently restrict the manipulation of key economic variables, such as tax rates or welfare benefits, at the scale necessary for robust analysis.  Furthermore, the long-term impacts of policies are difficult to capture within the timeframe of typical experiments.  Confounding variables, such as pre-existing social inequalities or unforeseen external shocks, further complicate the interpretation of results.  Finally, the multifaceted nature of well-being – encompassing physical and mental health, social connections, and subjective life satisfaction – requires sophisticated measurement strategies that can adequately capture its diverse dimensions and potentially conflicting effects from a single policy.  Overcoming these experimental hurdles is critical for developing evidence-based economic policies that genuinely improve social well-being.
