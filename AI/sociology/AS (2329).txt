This presentation explores the ongoing evolution of gender roles in modern societies, highlighting the interconnectedness of sociological, anthropological, and psychological perspectives.  While traditional gender binaries have historically structured social relations, contemporary societies are witnessing significant shifts driven by factors including technological advancements, globalization, and evolving legal frameworks.  We will examine how anthropological studies of diverse cultures illuminate the variability of gender constructions, challenging universalist assumptions.  Sociological analyses of work-life balance, occupational segregation, and political representation will demonstrate the persistent inequalities despite progress toward gender equality.  Furthermore, psychological research on gender identity development and cognitive biases will shed light on the individual-level processes that shape and are shaped by societal norms.  By integrating these disciplinary lenses, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between societal structures, individual agency, and the ongoing negotiation of gender roles in the 21st century.  The presentation will conclude by considering the challenges and opportunities for achieving genuine gender equity in the face of persistent challenges and emerging complexities.
