Class inequality, a persistent societal feature throughout history, manifests as the uneven distribution of resources, power, and opportunities based on socioeconomic status.  Historically, feudal systems solidified class divisions through inherited privilege and serfdom, while industrialization fostered a new dynamic between capitalists and the working class, resulting in stark inequalities reflected in living standards, access to education, and political influence.  Marxist theory, notably, posited class struggle as the engine of historical change, highlighting the inherent conflict between the bourgeoisie and proletariat.

The consequences of class inequality are profound and far-reaching.  Studies consistently demonstrate a correlation between lower socioeconomic status and poorer health outcomes, reduced life expectancy, and higher rates of crime and incarceration.  Educational attainment is significantly influenced by class, perpetuating intergenerational inequality.  Furthermore, unequal access to political participation undermines democratic ideals, allowing the affluent to disproportionately influence policy decisions that further entrench their advantage.  The resulting social stratification can destabilize societies, leading to increased social unrest and decreased social cohesion, impacting overall societal well-being and hindering economic progress.  Addressing class inequality, therefore, necessitates multifaceted interventions targeting education, healthcare, and economic policy to promote a more equitable and just society.
