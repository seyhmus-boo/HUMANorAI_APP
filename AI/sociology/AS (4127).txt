Globalization's impact on local cultures is akin to a river's confluence:  distinct tributaries (individual cultures) converge, creating a larger, more complex body of water (global culture).  This process, however, doesn't result in a homogenous blend.  Instead, a dynamic interaction occurs, with some tributaries dominating the flow, potentially leading to the erosion or submersion of smaller ones.  Think of Hollywood films' global reach – a powerful current impacting local filmmaking traditions.  Conversely, smaller streams can alter the main flow, injecting unique flavors and influencing global trends –  the global popularity of K-pop demonstrates this.

The outcome is neither complete assimilation nor total preservation.  Cultural hybridization is the dominant effect, a blending of elements where aspects of local cultures are selectively adopted, adapted, or resisted within a globalized framework.  This process is uneven and fraught with power dynamics, with some cultures experiencing more profound changes than others.  Therefore, globalization is not simply a homogenizing force, but rather a complex, multifaceted process generating a dynamic interplay between global and local influences, resulting in a hybrid cultural landscape.
