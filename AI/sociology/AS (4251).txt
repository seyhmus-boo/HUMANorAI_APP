This review examines the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, synthesizing existing literature to highlight key interdependencies.  While economic growth is often posited as a prerequisite for improved social well-being, the relationship is not straightforward.  Analysis reveals that the distributional effects of economic policies significantly impact social outcomes.  Policies prioritizing market liberalization, for instance, may boost aggregate wealth but simultaneously exacerbate income inequality and social fragmentation if not accompanied by robust social safety nets. Conversely, social protection programs, while enhancing well-being directly, can potentially impact economic efficiency if not implemented strategically.  Furthermore, the review underscores the importance of non-monetary indicators, such as health, education, and environmental sustainability, in a holistic assessment of social well-being.  Ultimately, effective policies require a nuanced understanding of these multifaceted relationships, moving beyond simplistic correlations between GDP growth and overall societal progress.  Future research should focus on developing more sophisticated econometric models capturing the diverse pathways through which economic interventions affect social well-being across various contexts.
