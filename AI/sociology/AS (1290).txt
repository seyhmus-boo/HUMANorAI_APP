The advent of social media, while relatively recent in historical terms, has profoundly impacted human behaviour.  Prior to its widespread adoption, interpersonal communication relied heavily on face-to-face interaction and traditional media.  The introduction of platforms like Facebook and Twitter initiated a paradigm shift, fostering unprecedented levels of interconnectedness.  This has manifested in both positive and negative consequences.

On one hand, social media facilitates rapid information dissemination and community building, fostering global movements and enabling marginalized voices to be heard.  However, this increased connectivity correlates with heightened anxieties surrounding social comparison, cyberbullying, and the erosion of privacy.  The curated nature of online profiles often leads to distorted perceptions of reality and contributes to feelings of inadequacy.  Furthermore, the addictive nature of these platforms, driven by algorithmic reinforcement, raises concerns about attention spans and mental well-being.  Research continues to explore the long-term effects of this pervasive technological influence on human psychology and societal structures.
