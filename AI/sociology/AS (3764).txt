This research paper examines the pivotal role of education in shaping and transforming social norms.  While the transmission of cultural values through socialization has long been acknowledged, the active contribution of formal educational systems in this process remains a complex and under-explored area.  We argue that education, beyond its primary function of knowledge dissemination, serves as a powerful mechanism for the inculcation, reinforcement, or even challenge of prevailing societal norms. This influence manifests through both overt curriculum design, explicitly addressing social issues and ethical dilemmas, and implicit processes embedded within the pedagogical approach and school environment.  The study will investigate how different educational models, pedagogical strategies, and institutional contexts differentially impact the internalization of norms related to gender equality, environmental sustainability, and civic engagement.  Understanding this dynamic holds significant practical applications, informing the design of educational interventions aimed at promoting positive social change.  This includes developing curricula that actively challenge harmful norms, creating inclusive learning environments that foster empathy and critical thinking, and utilizing educational platforms to disseminate information crucial for behaviour modification and societal progress. Ultimately, this research contributes to a nuanced understanding of the interplay between education and societal norms, with implications for policymaking and educational reform.
