The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being remains a central theme in contemporary social science research.  While economic growth has traditionally been considered a primary indicator of societal progress, recent developments have underscored the limitations of this narrow focus.  A burgeoning body of literature highlights the growing disparity between aggregate economic indicators and the lived experiences of individuals and communities, prompting a critical re-evaluation of the efficacy and equity of various economic policies.  This paper examines the multifaceted interplay between economic strategies and social well-being, considering recent shifts in global economic landscapes, particularly the rise of inequality, the impact of automation, and the increasing urgency of climate change mitigation.  We move beyond simplistic correlational analyses to explore the causal mechanisms through which specific policy interventions, such as taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulations, influence crucial aspects of social well-being including health, education, and environmental sustainability.  Finally, we analyze emerging policy recommendations aimed at fostering inclusive and sustainable economic growth that prioritizes human development and societal equity.
