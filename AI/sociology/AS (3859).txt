This presentation examines the evolving relationship between economic policies and social well-being, focusing on recent developments that challenge traditional neoclassical assumptions.  While economic growth has long been considered a primary driver of improved social well-being, recent research highlights the limitations of this simplistic view.  We explore the growing recognition of distributional effects, arguing that aggregate economic indicators alone fail to capture the uneven distribution of benefits and the persistence of social inequalities.

Recent advancements in measuring well-being, encompassing subjective measures like happiness and life satisfaction alongside objective indicators like health and education outcomes, allow for a more nuanced understanding. This presentation analyzes the impact of specific policy interventions – including minimum wage legislation, social safety nets, and investments in human capital – on various dimensions of social well-being, considering both intended and unintended consequences.  We further discuss the implications of automation, globalization, and climate change for this relationship, highlighting the need for policy interventions that actively address emerging challenges and promote inclusive and sustainable growth. Finally, we propose a framework for policymakers integrating well-being considerations into economic decision-making, moving beyond solely GDP-focused approaches.
