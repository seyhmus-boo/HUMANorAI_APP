This presentation explores the role of education in shaping social norms through a novel lens: quantum mechanics.  Traditional sociological models often treat norm adoption as a deterministic process.  However, we propose a quantum-like approach, viewing individual beliefs as superposition states, capable of existing in multiple norm-aligned possibilities simultaneously.  Education, then, acts as a "measurement" apparatus, collapsing these superpositions.  Curricula, pedagogical methods, and social interactions within educational settings influence the probabilities of particular norm-adoptions, akin to manipulating quantum wave functions.  We argue that implicit biases embedded in educational materials can create biased "measurement" outcomes, reinforcing existing societal inequalities.  Conversely, consciously designed curricula promoting diversity and critical thinking can steer probabilities towards more equitable norms.  Using conceptual analogies from quantum decoherence and entanglement, we will illustrate how peer influence, institutional structures, and the dissemination of information within educational environments collectively shape the “measurement” outcome, solidifying specific social norms within a population. This framework offers a novel perspective on educational reform, suggesting interventions that strategically manipulate probabilities towards desired societal outcomes.
