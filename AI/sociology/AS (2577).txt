Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies since the advent of stratified social structures, continues to exert profound and multifaceted effects on societal well-being.  Historically, feudal systems and subsequent industrial revolutions cemented class divisions based on ownership of capital and access to resources, leading to disparities in health, education, and political power.  Contemporary research demonstrates a strong correlation between class inequality and various negative social outcomes.  Higher levels of inequality are associated with reduced social mobility, increased crime rates, poorer population health (including higher rates of infant mortality and chronic disease), and diminished overall societal trust.  Furthermore, unequal distribution of wealth exacerbates political polarization, undermining democratic processes and hindering effective policy responses to social problems.  While the specific mechanisms linking inequality to these outcomes remain a subject of ongoing debate (e.g., psychosocial stress vs. resource scarcity),  the overwhelming evidence underscores the detrimental impact of pronounced class divisions on social cohesion, economic efficiency, and overall societal health.  Future research should focus on targeted interventions and policies aimed at reducing inequality and promoting greater equity for improved societal outcomes.
