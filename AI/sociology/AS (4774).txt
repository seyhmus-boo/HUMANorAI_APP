This presentation examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, focusing on recent developments and challenges.  While conventional economic wisdom often prioritizes GDP growth as a primary indicator of societal progress, a growing body of research highlights the limitations of this approach, particularly in capturing dimensions of well-being beyond material prosperity.  Recent events, including the COVID-19 pandemic and escalating global inflation, have underscored the vulnerabilities of populations disproportionately affected by economic shocks, demonstrating the limitations of solely growth-oriented policies.

This presentation will explore the evolving understanding of social well-being, incorporating indicators such as health, education, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion.  We will analyze recent policy interventions – including universal basic income pilots and investments in social safety nets – and their impact on diverse communities.  Further, we will critically assess the role of fiscal policy in addressing inequality and promoting inclusive growth.  Finally, the presentation will discuss the challenges of measuring and evaluating the long-term effects of economic policies on social well-being, emphasizing the need for more integrated and holistic approaches to policymaking that prioritize both economic growth and social justice.
