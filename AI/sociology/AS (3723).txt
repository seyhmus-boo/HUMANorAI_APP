Class inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across societal strata, exerts profound and multifaceted effects on social cohesion and well-being.  This lecture explores the empirical evidence linking class disparities to a range of negative societal outcomes.  Firstly, high levels of inequality are demonstrably correlated with reduced social mobility, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting individual potential.  Secondly, inequality exacerbates health disparities, with lower socioeconomic groups experiencing higher rates of morbidity and mortality due to factors such as reduced access to quality healthcare and increased exposure to environmental hazards.  Furthermore, significant class divisions foster social unrest and political instability, as marginalized groups experience disenfranchisement and a lack of representation.  Finally,  economic inequality undermines social trust, weakening the fabric of community and hindering collective action to address shared challenges.  Addressing class inequality requires multi-faceted interventions targeting education, healthcare, employment opportunities, and social safety nets, ultimately aiming to create a more just and equitable society.
