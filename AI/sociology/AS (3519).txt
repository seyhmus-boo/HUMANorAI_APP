This presentation examines the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on societal well-being.  We will argue that class inequality, extending beyond simple disparities in income, encompasses unequal access to resources, opportunities, and social capital, significantly impacting health, education, and social mobility.  Drawing upon established sociological and economic theories, we will explore the mechanisms through which class inequality perpetuates itself across generations, fostering social stratification and hindering collective progress.  Specific examples will include the impact of unequal access to quality healthcare on life expectancy and the correlation between socioeconomic status and educational attainment.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the consequences of high levels of inequality on social cohesion, political polarization, and economic stability.  Finally, we will discuss practical applications for mitigating class inequality, focusing on policy interventions such as progressive taxation, investment in public services (education and healthcare), and the promotion of fair employment practices.  The aim is to highlight the urgent need for comprehensive strategies to address this persistent social challenge and foster a more equitable and just society.
