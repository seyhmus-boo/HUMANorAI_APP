This presentation examines the ongoing evolution of gender roles in modern societies, focusing on the methodological challenges inherent in empirically investigating this complex phenomenon.  While societal norms surrounding gender are demonstrably shifting, measuring the extent and nature of this change presents significant hurdles.  Traditional survey methodologies, relying on self-reported attitudes and behaviours, are susceptible to social desirability bias and may not fully capture nuanced expressions of gender identity and performance.  Experimental approaches, while offering potential solutions, face their own limitations.  For instance, manipulating gendered stimuli in experimental settings can inadvertently reinforce existing stereotypes, rather than revealing underlying processes.  Furthermore, the ecological validity of laboratory-based experiments, particularly concerning complex social behaviours, is often questionable.  This presentation will critically discuss the strengths and weaknesses of various experimental designs commonly employed in the study of gender roles, including priming paradigms, field experiments, and virtual reality simulations. We will argue for a multi-method approach, integrating experimental data with qualitative insights, to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic and multifaceted nature of evolving gender roles in contemporary societies.  Finally, we will propose avenues for future research, emphasizing the need for ethical and culturally sensitive methodologies.
