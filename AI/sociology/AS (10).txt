Class inequality, the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities across social strata, presents significant challenges to empirical investigation. While observational studies readily reveal correlations between class and various social outcomes (e.g., health, education, crime), establishing causal links proves difficult.  The inherent complexities of social stratification make isolating the independent effect of class from confounding variables – such as individual agency, inherited traits, and neighborhood effects – a formidable task.  Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard for causal inference, are ethically problematic and practically infeasible in this context.  Quasi-experimental designs, employing techniques like regression discontinuity or instrumental variables, offer partial solutions, but are often limited by the availability of appropriate instruments and the potential for unobserved confounders.  Furthermore, the subjective nature of class itself, encompassing economic, social, and cultural dimensions, complicates measurement and introduces significant methodological uncertainties. Consequently, establishing a robust causal link between class inequality and its societal effects, such as social cohesion erosion and intergenerational mobility limitations, remains a crucial challenge for social science research.
