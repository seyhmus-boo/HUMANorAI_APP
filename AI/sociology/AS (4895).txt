The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, posing significant challenges for experimental investigation.  While macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth are often used as proxies for societal improvement,  they fail to capture the nuanced aspects of well-being encompassing health, education, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a gold standard in evaluating policy effectiveness, face limitations in this context.  The inherent difficulty in isolating the impact of a specific economic policy from other concurrent social and political factors necessitates rigorous control groups and sophisticated statistical modeling to minimize confounding variables.  Furthermore, the long-term effects of economic policies on social well-being often unfold gradually, making it challenging to obtain conclusive results within the timeframe of typical experimental studies.  Ethical concerns also arise when implementing policies with potentially negative consequences on specific subgroups within the population, requiring careful consideration of distributive justice and equity in the experimental design.  The inherent complexity of human behavior and the multi-dimensional nature of well-being necessitate a multi-method approach, combining experimental findings with qualitative data and longitudinal studies to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between economic policy and social outcomes.
