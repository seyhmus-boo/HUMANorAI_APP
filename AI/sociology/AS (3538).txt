This presentation addresses the significant challenges in experimentally investigating the societal effects of class inequality. While observational studies readily demonstrate strong correlations between socioeconomic disparities and various negative societal outcomes (e.g., reduced social mobility, increased crime rates, poorer health indicators), establishing causal relationships remains elusive due to the inherent complexity and ethical limitations of manipulating class inequality in experimental settings.  We will discuss the methodological hurdles presented by the difficulty in randomly assigning individuals to different class strata, the long-term nature of causal effects necessitating longitudinal studies with substantial resource commitments, and the ethical concerns surrounding the potential for exacerbating existing inequalities.  We will explore alternative experimental approaches, such as natural experiments leveraging policy shocks or utilizing lab-in-the-field designs to model specific aspects of inequalityâ€™s impact on behaviour, attitudes, and social interactions.  The presentation concludes by considering the potential of agent-based modelling and other computational methods to complement experimental approaches, offering a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between class inequality and its cascading consequences for society.  The goal is to stimulate discussion on innovative experimental designs and methodologies needed to advance causal inference in this critical area of research.
