Class inequality, a persistent societal feature, continues to exert profound and multifaceted effects on individuals and communities. This paper examines the pervasive impact of class stratification on various aspects of social life, moving beyond simplistic economic disparities to explore its intricate influence on health, education, political participation, and social mobility.  Existing literature largely acknowledges the correlation between class and these outcomes, but further research is needed to unpack the complex causal mechanisms at play and assess the relative contribution of different dimensions of inequality (e.g., income, wealth, occupation).  This study contributes to this area by employing a mixed-methods approach, integrating quantitative analysis of national-level data with qualitative insights derived from in-depth interviews with individuals from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. We specifically investigate the mediating roles of social capital and access to resources in exacerbating or mitigating the effects of class inequality across the examined domains. The findings offer a nuanced understanding of the societal costs associated with persistent class stratification and propose policy recommendations to promote greater equity and social justice.
