This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, tracing its evolution from early online forums to the contemporary landscape dominated by platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.  Historically, the development of networked communication technologies has consistently altered social structures and individual interactions, albeit at varying speeds and scales.  While early forms fostered niche communities, the pervasiveness and accessibility of modern social media have exponentially amplified these effects.  We will analyze the influence of social media on several key behavioral domains: information consumption and dissemination (including the spread of misinformation), social identity formation and self-esteem, political engagement and polarization, and mental health and wellbeing.  The presentation will explore both positive and negative consequences, considering the role of algorithmic curation, social comparison, and the creation of echo chambers.  Finally, it will briefly discuss emerging research on mitigating negative impacts and promoting responsible social media usage, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary approaches involving psychology, sociology, and computer science.
