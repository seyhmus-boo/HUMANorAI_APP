This presentation explores the dynamic evolution of gender roles in contemporary societies, drawing upon insights from sociology, anthropology, economics, and psychology.  While traditional gender binaries persist, we observe significant shifts driven by factors including increased female education and labor force participation, technological advancements altering domestic labor, and evolving social attitudes regarding gender identity and expression.  We will analyze how economic structures influence gendered occupational segregation and wage gaps, highlighting the interplay between societal norms and individual agency. Anthropological perspectives will shed light on the diverse expressions of gender across cultures, challenging universalistic models.  Furthermore, psychological research on gender socialization and stereotype threat will be integrated to understand the internalization of gender roles and their impact on individual well-being.  By adopting an interdisciplinary lens, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the ongoing transformation of gender roles, acknowledging both progress and persistent inequalities, and highlighting pathways for future research and social change.  The presentation will conclude by considering the implications of these evolving roles for policy and social justice initiatives.
