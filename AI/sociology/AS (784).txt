Globalization's impact on local cultures remains a complex and contested topic. This presentation examines recent developments highlighting the nuanced interplay between global flows and cultural resilience.  While homogenization narratives persist, focusing on the dominance of global brands and media,  recent research reveals a more intricate reality.  We will explore the phenomenon of "glocalization," where global trends are adapted and reinterpreted to suit local contexts, generating hybrid cultural forms.  Specific examples will include the appropriation and re-signification of global pop music in marginalized communities and the resurgence of local artisan crafts infused with global design elements.  Furthermore, we will analyze the role of digital technologies in both the dissemination of global culture and the preservation and promotion of local traditions, focusing on the use of social media platforms for cultural revitalization initiatives.  Ultimately, this presentation argues against a simplistic view of cultural dominance, suggesting a more dynamic model where globalization acts as a catalyst for both cultural exchange and contestation, resulting in multifaceted and evolving cultural landscapes.
