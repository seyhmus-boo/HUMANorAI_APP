Social movements, like powerful currents in a river, are collective actions driven by shared grievances and a desire for societal transformation.  They act as catalysts for change, reshaping the social landscape in much the same way that a river carves a new path through a landscape over time.  Consider the suffrage movement:  initially a mere trickle of dissent, it gradually swelled into a torrent of activism, ultimately reshaping political systems by extending voting rights.  Similarly, the Civil Rights Movement in the United States, akin to a forceful flood, overwhelmed the entrenched system of racial segregation, leaving behind a profoundly altered social order, although the aftereffects continue to be felt.  These movements, however, don't always achieve immediate and complete success; they may resemble a meandering stream, encountering obstacles and diversions along the way, experiencing periods of ebb and flow before ultimately achieving – or failing to achieve – their objectives. The impact of a social movement is contingent upon various factors, including its organizational capacity, the prevailing political climate, and the level of public support, all of which influence the potency and lasting effects of its "current" on the societal landscape.  Understanding these dynamic interactions is crucial to analyzing the multifaceted role of social movements in driving and shaping societal change.
