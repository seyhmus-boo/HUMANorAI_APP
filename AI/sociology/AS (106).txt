Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, conventionally analyzed through sociological and economic lenses, offers a compelling avenue for investigation through a novel, albeit metaphorical, quantum mechanical framework.  This paper argues that the concept of superposition, central to quantum theory, can illuminate the paradoxical nature of societal stratification.  Individuals, much like quantum particles, exist in a superposition of potential outcomes, their life trajectories contingent upon their initial class position. However, unlike the equal probability inherent in idealized quantum systems, societal structures introduce a strong bias, collapsing the wave function of potential towards predetermined outcomes based on inherited or acquired class.  This "measurement" – the act of societal interaction – reinforces existing inequalities, limiting upward mobility and exacerbating the entanglement between individuals and their class-defined realities.  This entanglement, analogous to quantum entanglement, suggests that interventions targeting individual mobility may prove insufficient without simultaneous efforts to address the systemic biases that determine the probability amplitudes of different life outcomes. We explore this unconventional framework, drawing parallels between quantum phenomena like wave function collapse and societal reinforcement mechanisms, to provide a novel perspective on the pervasive and interconnected nature of class inequality's effects.
