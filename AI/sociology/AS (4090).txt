Education plays a crucial role in shaping and perpetuating, or challenging and altering, social norms.  Formal education, through curriculum design and pedagogical approaches, transmits societal values and expectations to successive generations.  The socialization process embedded within educational institutions reinforces existing norms by implicitly and explicitly rewarding conformity and sanctioning deviation.  For instance, classroom management techniques and disciplinary actions often uphold established behavioral standards.

However, education also possesses the capacity to foster critical thinking and social awareness, potentially leading to norm change.  Exposure to diverse perspectives within the curriculum, coupled with participatory learning methodologies, can encourage questioning of entrenched norms and the development of alternative values.  Furthermore, educational initiatives focusing on social justice and human rights can actively promote shifts in societal expectations related to equality, inclusion, and respect.  Practical applications include implementing culturally responsive pedagogy, integrating critical media literacy into curricula, and fostering inclusive school environments that challenge prejudice and discrimination.  This transformative potential of education hinges on intentional curriculum development and a commitment to fostering intellectual autonomy.
