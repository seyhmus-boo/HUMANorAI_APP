Good morning. Today's lecture examines class inequality and its multifaceted societal impacts, drawing upon insights from sociology, economics, and political science.  Class inequality, defined as the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities based on socioeconomic status, permeates societal structures.  Sociologically, this manifests in disparities in access to education, healthcare, and social mobility, perpetuating cycles of poverty and disadvantage.  Economically, inequality fuels instability through decreased aggregate demand and heightened financial risk, as wealth concentrates in fewer hands.  Furthermore, political science illuminates how inequality erodes democratic participation, as marginalized groups face diminished political influence and representation.  Consequently, we observe a correlation between high levels of inequality and social unrest, decreased social cohesion, and ultimately, diminished societal well-being.  Understanding these interdisciplinary connections is crucial for formulating effective policy interventions aimed at promoting a more just and equitable society.
