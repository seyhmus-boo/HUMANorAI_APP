This research paper investigates the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms, exploring the dynamic interplay between formal learning environments and the broader societal context.  While predominantly studied through sociological and pedagogical lenses, the impact of education on norm formation necessitates an interdisciplinary approach. We draw upon insights from sociology, focusing on socialization theories and the transmission of cultural values; pedagogy, examining the curriculum's role in shaping beliefs and attitudes; psychology, considering cognitive development and the internalization of norms; and anthropology, analyzing the influence of educational systems on cultural preservation and transformation.  This interdisciplinary framework allows for a nuanced understanding of how educational institutions not only transmit existing norms but also actively contribute to their evolution and contestation. We argue that the curriculum, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment collectively influence the development of individual moral reasoning and subsequent behavioral patterns, ultimately contributing to the maintenance, modification, or even rejection of prevailing social norms. This study aims to illuminate these complex relationships and their implications for societal change.
