This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a simplistic cause-and-effect model is insufficient.  We posit that the economy and society are not separate entities, but rather interconnected vessels.  Economic policies, analogous to the valves regulating the flow of water (resources and wealth) in these vessels, significantly impact the overall water level (social well-being).  A purely growth-focused policy, like a wide-open valve, might initially raise the level in one area, but lead to overflows (inequality) and droughts (social deprivation) in others.

Conversely, overly restrictive policies, akin to tightly closed valves, might prevent overflows but result in stagnant water, hindering overall well-being. Optimal social well-being, therefore, necessitates a nuanced approach to policy-makingâ€”a delicate balancing act of valve adjustments. This requires considering not just aggregate economic indicators, but also the distribution of resources and their impact on diverse social groups. We will analyze several case studies, demonstrating how different policy approaches, through their effects on income inequality, access to healthcare and education, and environmental sustainability, profoundly shape overall social well-being.  Ultimately, we advocate for a holistic framework that views economic policies as instruments for fostering equitable and sustainable social development, rather than solely pursuing maximal economic output.
