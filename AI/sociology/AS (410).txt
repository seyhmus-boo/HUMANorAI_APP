Social movements, the collective actions of individuals pursuing shared goals, are potent agents of societal transformation.  Think of them as the tectonic plates of society: individually, they may seem immobile, but over time, their persistent pressure generates seismic shifts.  These shifts aren't always immediate or easily observable; like glaciers carving canyons, social movements slowly reshape the landscape of norms, laws, and institutions.

Consider the Civil Rights Movement in the United States: its sustained pressure, akin to a relentless river eroding bedrock, eventually breached the dam of racial segregation.  Conversely, movements can fail, like a dam holding back a flood, but even unsuccessful campaigns can leave lasting imprints.  For instance, even though a movement might not achieve its ultimate objective, it can raise awareness, creating cracks in the existing societal structures, paving the way for future victories.  Ultimately, understanding social movements necessitates examining their diverse strategies,  their capacity to frame issues, mobilize resources, and ultimately, negotiate power within existing power structures to achieve meaningful societal change.
