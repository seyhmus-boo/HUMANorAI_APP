This presentation examines the evolving role of education in shaping social norms, focusing on recent developments in pedagogical approaches and their impact on societal values.  Traditional educational models emphasized transmission of knowledge and established norms; however, contemporary scholarship highlights education's capacity for transformative social change.  Recent research underscores the efficacy of experiential learning, inclusive curricula, and critical pedagogy in challenging entrenched biases and promoting positive social norms around issues such as gender equality, environmental sustainability, and civic engagement.  We will analyze the effectiveness of specific educational interventions, including diversity and inclusion training, social-emotional learning programs, and community-based learning initiatives, in fostering prosocial behaviors and altering societal expectations.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the limitations and challenges inherent in using education to shape social norms, considering factors such as societal resistance to change, the influence of extra-curricular factors, and the need for ongoing evaluation and refinement of educational strategies.  Finally, we propose a framework for future research focusing on the long-term impact of innovative educational approaches on the formation and evolution of social norms.
