Education plays a crucial role in shaping and perpetuating, or challenging and transforming, social norms.  Its influence spans multiple disciplines.  Sociologists highlight how educational institutions transmit cultural values and beliefs through curricula, pedagogy, and social interactions within the school environment.  These transmitted norms, whether explicitly stated or implicitly conveyed, influence students' perceptions of acceptable behaviour, gender roles, and social hierarchies.

Anthropologists contribute by emphasizing the role of education in mediating cultural transmission across generations, highlighting how educational systems can both reinforce existing inequalities or serve as agents of social change.  Psychology illuminates the cognitive and developmental processes through which individuals internalize social norms, emphasizing the impact of learning environments on moral development and prosocial behaviour.  Furthermore, economics underscores the link between education and social mobility, showcasing how access to education can disrupt entrenched social norms and facilitate social advancement.  Therefore, understanding the multifaceted influence of education on social norms requires an interdisciplinary approach that synthesizes insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics.
