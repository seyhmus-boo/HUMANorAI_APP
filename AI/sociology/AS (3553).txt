Social media's rapid proliferation since the late 2000s has profoundly impacted human behavior, necessitating a comprehensive understanding of its effects.  Early research focused on the affordances of online communities, emphasizing enhanced social connection and information dissemination. However, subsequent studies have revealed a more complex interplay of positive and negative consequences.  Increased social comparison, facilitated by curated online personas, is linked to heightened anxiety and depression, particularly among adolescents.  Exposure to misinformation and echo chambers can distort perceptions of reality and fuel polarization, impacting political engagement and social cohesion.  Furthermore, addictive patterns of usage, driven by reward mechanisms embedded in platform design, contribute to decreased productivity and compromised well-being.  While social media fosters connectivity and facilitates social movements, its pervasive influence necessitates critical examination of its impact on mental health, information processing, and democratic processes. Future research should focus on mitigating negative consequences through platform regulation, media literacy initiatives, and a deeper understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying social media's influence on behavior.
