This paper examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, drawing upon insights from economics, sociology, and political science.  While traditional economic models often focus on aggregate indicators like GDP, a comprehensive understanding necessitates incorporating multifaceted measures of well-being encompassing health, education, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability.  We argue that the effectiveness of economic policies in enhancing social well-being is contingent upon their distributional impacts and the extent to which they address societal inequalities.  Sociological perspectives highlight the influence of social capital, trust, and community cohesion on individual well-being, factors often overlooked in purely economic analyses.  Furthermore, political science contributes crucial insights into the political feasibility and implementation challenges of policies aimed at improving social outcomes, considering factors like political power dynamics and institutional constraints.  An interdisciplinary approach is essential for designing and evaluating economic policies that truly foster societal well-being, moving beyond narrow economic metrics to encompass a holistic understanding of human flourishing and its determinants. This necessitates a shift towards policy frameworks that prioritize equity, sustainability, and inclusive growth.
