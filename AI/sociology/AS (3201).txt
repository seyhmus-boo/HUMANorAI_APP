Education plays a multifaceted role in shaping social norms, acting as both a transmitter and transformer of societal values.  Recent research highlights the nuanced interplay between formal curricula, informal learning environments, and individual agency in this process.  While traditional approaches emphasize the transmission of established norms through explicit instruction and socialization, emerging scholarship underscores the crucial role of critical pedagogy in challenging and reshaping existing norms.  Studies employing longitudinal designs and mixed-methods approaches demonstrate that educational interventions, particularly those emphasizing participatory learning and critical thinking, can effectively promote positive social change by fostering empathy, tolerance, and prosocial behaviors.  However, the effectiveness of these interventions is contingent upon broader socio-cultural contexts and existing power dynamics within educational institutions.  Furthermore,  investigations into the impact of digital technologies on education reveal both opportunities (e.g., increased access to diverse perspectives) and challenges (e.g., spread of misinformation and echo chambers) in shaping norms in the contemporary digital landscape.  Future research should focus on developing and evaluating culturally sensitive educational interventions that effectively promote positive norm change while addressing the complex interplay of individual agency and structural constraints.
