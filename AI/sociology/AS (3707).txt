Class inequality, a persistent societal ill, significantly impacts various aspects of human life, from health and education to political participation and social cohesion. While the existence of class inequality is widely acknowledged,  quantifying its precise effects and isolating its causal mechanisms remains a significant challenge for social scientists. This paper addresses the inherent methodological difficulties in rigorously researching the multifaceted consequences of class stratification.  Existing research often relies on observational data, susceptible to confounding factors and endogeneity biases that hinder causal inference.  Establishing causality, crucial for effective policy design, demands more robust methodologies.  We explore the limitations of observational studies, highlighting issues such as omitted variable bias and reverse causality in relation to specific societal outcomes like intergenerational mobility and health disparities.  Furthermore, we examine the potential and limitations of experimental approaches, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and natural experiments, in addressing these challenges.  While ethical and practical limitations exist, we argue that strategically designed experimental research, combined with sophisticated statistical techniques, offers the most promising avenue for a deeper understanding of class inequality's pervasive and complex societal ramifications.
