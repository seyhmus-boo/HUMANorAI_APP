This abstract proposes a novel framework for understanding class inequality through the lens of quantum mechanical principles.  We posit that societal structures, analogous to quantum systems, exhibit emergent properties arising from the complex interplay of individual agents (particles) and their interactions.  Class inequality, represented as a potential energy landscape, significantly influences the distribution of societal "wave functions," representing individual opportunities and outcomes.  High inequality creates a deeply uneven potential well, restricting the probability amplitude of individuals from lower classes accessing higher energy states (e.g., education, wealth accumulation). This confinement leads to a decrease in societal coherence, analogous to a reduction in wave function overlap, resulting in increased social stratification and reduced overall system stability.  The entropic consequences of this inequality are explored, suggesting a link between heightened social disorder and the lack of equitable energy distribution.  Further research should investigate the application of quantum entanglement and decoherence models to explain the propagation of inequality across generations and the emergence of collective social action aimed at mitigating these effects.  This approach opens new avenues for analyzing complex societal dynamics through a fundamentally different, yet potentially powerful, theoretical lens.
