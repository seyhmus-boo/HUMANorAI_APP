Class inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across societal strata, exerts profound and multifaceted effects on society.  This paper explores the theoretical underpinnings of this inequality, focusing on its impact on social cohesion, health outcomes, and political participation.  We posit that significant class disparities erode social trust and generate social fragmentation, leading to increased crime rates and decreased civic engagement.  Furthermore, persistent inequality contributes to disparities in health and well-being, manifesting in higher morbidity and mortality rates among lower socioeconomic groups due to factors like limited access to healthcare and increased stress.  This unequal access extends to political processes, with wealthier classes wielding disproportionate influence on policy formulation and implementation, further entrenching existing inequalities.  This analysis suggests that addressing class inequality requires a multi-pronged approach targeting not only income redistribution but also structural factors perpetuating unequal access to education, healthcare, and political power.  Further research should examine the complex interplay of these factors and explore effective policy interventions to mitigate the negative societal consequences of class inequality.
