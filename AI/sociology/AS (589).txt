This presentation examines the enduring impact of class inequality on societal structures and outcomes.  Historically, class stratification, emerging from feudal systems and solidified during the Industrial Revolution, has consistently shaped access to resources, opportunities, and power.  While the manifestations of class have evolved – from landed gentry to contemporary wealth disparities – the core issue of unequal distribution of capital and social capital remains. We will explore the historical trajectory of class inequality, highlighting shifts in its composition and mechanisms of reproduction across different socio-economic systems.

The presentation will then analyze the multifaceted consequences of this inequality.  We will consider its impact on various social determinants of health, including life expectancy, morbidity rates, and access to quality healthcare.  Furthermore, the effects on educational attainment, social mobility, and political participation will be discussed, demonstrating how entrenched class systems limit social progress and perpetuate cycles of disadvantage.  Finally, we will briefly address current debates regarding the measurement and mitigation of class inequality, considering the limitations of existing frameworks and the potential for policy interventions aimed at promoting greater equity and social justice.
