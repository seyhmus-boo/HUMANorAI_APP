This presentation explores the complex interplay between cultural diversity and social integration, focusing on recent theoretical and empirical developments.  While increased cultural diversity often enriches societies, it also presents challenges to cohesive social structures.  Recent research highlights the nuanced nature of this relationship, moving beyond simplistic assimilationist models to embrace more inclusive perspectives.  We will examine the impact of factors such as institutional policies, community initiatives, and individual agency on the integration process.  Specific attention will be given to the role of intergroup contact, emphasizing the conditions under which positive contact fosters integration versus exacerbating existing social divisions.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the limitations of existing integration frameworks, considering the role of power imbalances and systemic inequalities in shaping integration outcomes.  Finally, we will discuss emerging methodologies for measuring social integration in diverse societies, highlighting the challenges of accurately capturing subjective experiences and the need for more culturally sensitive assessment tools.  The presentation concludes by suggesting avenues for fostering inclusive societies that celebrate cultural diversity while promoting effective social cohesion.
