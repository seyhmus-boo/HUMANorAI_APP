Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the persistent challenge of empirically validating the societal effects of class inequality. While the existence of inequality is readily observable, establishing causal links between it and specific social ills proves experimentally difficult.  Randomised controlled trials, the gold standard in causal inference, are ethically problematic and practically impossible to implement on a societal scale to manipulate class structures.  Observational studies, while more feasible, suffer from confounding variables –  it’s difficult to isolate the impact of class from other factors like access to education or healthcare.

Furthermore, measuring class itself presents a methodological hurdle.  Is it income, wealth, occupation, or a combination?  Different metrics yield different results, complicating cross-study comparisons and hindering the establishment of robust conclusions.  This lack of methodological consensus hampers our ability to build a comprehensive understanding of inequality's impact on health outcomes, educational attainment, crime rates, and political participation.  Consequently, robust experimental evidence remains a significant challenge in this critical area of social science research.  Further methodological innovation is crucial to advance our understanding of this pervasive social issue.
