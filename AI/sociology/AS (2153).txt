Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, play a crucial role in effecting societal change. This paper theorizes their impact through a lens of resource mobilization and framing.  Resource mobilization theory posits that successful movements leverage diverse resources – material, human, and symbolic – to overcome state repression and mobilize support.  Framing, conversely, highlights the construction of shared meaning and narratives that resonate with potential participants, legitimizing the movement's goals and actions.  The interaction between these processes shapes the movement's trajectory, determining its efficacy in influencing policy, altering public opinion, and ultimately prompting societal transformation.  Successful movements effectively frame their grievances within a broader societal narrative, mobilizing resources to amplify their message and exert pressure on power structures.  However, the paper also acknowledges the limitations of this approach, recognizing the impact of counter-movements and the inherent power imbalances that often constrain movement success.  Further research should explore the intersectionality of these factors and the long-term consequences of movement activity on institutional change.
