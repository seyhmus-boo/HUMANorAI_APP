The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a central concern in social science, yet establishing robust causal links remains challenging. This abstract discusses inherent experimental difficulties in assessing this relationship. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard for causal inference, face significant limitations when applied to macroeconomic policy interventions.  Ethical considerations often preclude manipulating large-scale economic policies randomly, particularly those with potentially negative societal consequences. Furthermore, the long-term effects of such policies are often difficult to isolate from confounding factors like technological advancements or global economic shocks, limiting the generalizability of findings from smaller-scale experiments.  Quasi-experimental approaches, such as difference-in-differences or regression discontinuity designs, offer alternatives but are vulnerable to biases stemming from imperfect control groups or selection effects.  Measuring social well-being itself presents further complexities, necessitating the integration of multifaceted indicators spanning subjective well-being, health outcomes, and social cohesion. The development of sophisticated econometric techniques and a nuanced understanding of the limitations inherent in different experimental designs are crucial for advancing our knowledge of this critical relationship.  Future research should prioritize the development of innovative experimental designs that address these challenges while upholding ethical standards.
