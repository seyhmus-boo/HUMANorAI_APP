This review examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, synthesizing existing literature across diverse disciplines.  While economic growth is often posited as a primary driver of improved social well-being, the review highlights the nuanced and often contradictory findings regarding this relationship.  Analyses reveal that the distributional effects of economic policies are crucial, with policies focused solely on aggregate growth potentially exacerbating inequalities and failing to enhance well-being for significant segments of the population.  Furthermore, the review underscores the importance of considering non-monetary indicators of well-being, such as health, education, and environmental sustainability, alongside traditional economic metrics like GDP.  A critical assessment of policy interventions, including social safety nets, active labor market policies, and environmental regulations, reveals their varying impacts on different social groups and the long-term sustainability of well-being gains.  The review concludes by emphasizing the necessity of adopting a multidimensional approach to policymaking, integrating economic goals with broader social objectives to ensure equitable and sustainable improvements in social well-being.  Future research should focus on developing robust methodologies for measuring and evaluating the multifaceted impacts of economic policies on diverse populations.
