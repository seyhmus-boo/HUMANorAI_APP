This presentation explores the complex interplay between cultural diversity and social integration, focusing on recent developments in research and policy.  While globalization has fostered unprecedented levels of cultural mixing, the impact on social cohesion remains a subject of ongoing debate.  Recent studies highlight the nuanced relationship between diversity and integration, challenging simplistic assumptions of either inherent conflict or automatic harmony.  We will examine the growing body of evidence demonstrating the mediating role of factors such as intergroup contact, institutional policies promoting inclusivity, and the prevalence of societal narratives framing diversity.  Specifically, we will discuss the effectiveness of  policies aimed at fostering intercultural dialogue and addressing systemic inequalities, drawing upon examples from both successful and unsuccessful integration initiatives.  Furthermore, we will analyze the rise of  "superdiversity" – characterized by increasingly complex forms of cultural mixing and overlapping identities – and its implications for social integration strategies.  The presentation concludes by suggesting avenues for future research focusing on the development of more effective, context-specific approaches to promoting genuine and equitable social integration in diverse societies.
