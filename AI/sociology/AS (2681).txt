This review examines the complex and multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  While economic growth is often posited as a primary driver of improved social outcomes, the literature reveals a nuanced picture.  Empirical studies demonstrate a strong correlation between macroeconomic indicators like GDP per capita and metrics of well-being such as life expectancy and educational attainment, but this relationship is not uniformly positive across all contexts.  Distributional effects of economic policies, particularly concerning income inequality and access to essential services (healthcare, education, housing), are shown to significantly moderate the impact on social well-being.  Furthermore, qualitative factors such as social cohesion, environmental sustainability, and political stability, although often overlooked in purely economic models, are increasingly recognized as crucial determinants of overall societal welfare.  The review highlights the limitations of solely relying on GDP as a measure of societal progress and advocates for the adoption of multidimensional well-being indices that incorporate a broader range of social, environmental, and economic indicators.  Future research should focus on developing and rigorously testing policy interventions designed to optimize both economic growth and social well-being, emphasizing equitable distribution of resources and a holistic approach to societal development.
