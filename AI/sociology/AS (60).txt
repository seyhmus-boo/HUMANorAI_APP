Good morning. Today's lecture examines class inequality and its societal ramifications, drawing upon insights from sociology, economics, and political science.  Class inequality, the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities based on socioeconomic status, profoundly impacts societal well-being.  Sociologically, it manifests in stratified social structures, reinforcing disparities in access to education, healthcare, and social mobility.  Economically, inequality contributes to decreased aggregate demand, hindering economic growth, and fostering cycles of poverty.  Furthermore, unequal access to resources strengthens existing power imbalances, as explored by political scientists. This disparity influences political participation, potentially leading to policies that further benefit the privileged while marginalizing the disadvantaged.  The interdisciplinary lens reveals the intricate web of interconnected factors perpetuating inequality â€“ impacting not only individual lives but also the overall health and stability of the social fabric.  Addressing this multifaceted challenge requires holistic, interdisciplinary approaches.
