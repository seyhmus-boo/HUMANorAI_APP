This presentation examines the persistent challenge of experimentally investigating the multifaceted effects of class inequality on societal outcomes. While observational studies readily demonstrate correlations between socioeconomic disparities and various social ills, establishing causal links remains elusive. We discuss the inherent difficulties in designing robust experiments that manipulate class inequality without introducing confounding variables or ethical concerns.  The limitations of existing experimental methodologies, such as laboratory simulations and field experiments using incentivized games, are critically assessed.  Specifically, we explore the challenges of capturing the long-term, systemic nature of class inequality within the constraints of experimental design.  Furthermore, we address the ethical considerations surrounding the deliberate manipulation of socioeconomic status in experimental settings, including potential psychological harm and the risk of reinforcing existing inequalities.  Finally, we propose avenues for future research, including the potential of integrating qualitative methods with experimental designs to achieve a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between class inequality and societal well-being, thereby facilitating the development of effective policy interventions.
