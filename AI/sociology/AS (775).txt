This review examines the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms, focusing on its influence across individual, societal, and generational levels.  Education acts as a primary vehicle for transmitting societal values and beliefs, thereby reinforcing existing norms or facilitating their evolution.  Curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment significantly impact students' internalization of social norms related to gender roles, ethnicity, civic engagement, and health behaviors.  While education can promote positive social change by fostering critical thinking and challenging discriminatory norms, it can also inadvertently perpetuate inequalities through biased curricula or discriminatory practices.  Research highlights the effectiveness of inclusive education models and culturally responsive pedagogy in cultivating positive social norms and reducing prejudice.  However, the impact of education is not uniform; socio-economic factors and pre-existing societal structures significantly moderate its influence.  Further research should explore the long-term effects of education on norm internalization, investigate the impact of diverse educational settings, and examine effective strategies for utilizing education to promote socially desirable behavioral changes.
