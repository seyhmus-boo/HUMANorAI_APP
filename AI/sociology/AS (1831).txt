This review examines the multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being, synthesizing existing literature across diverse disciplines.  While economic growth is often posited as a primary driver of improved social well-being, the review highlights the crucial mediating role of policy design and implementation.  Analysis reveals that policies focused solely on GDP growth, neglecting distributional effects and social determinants of health, can exacerbate inequalities and ultimately hinder overall well-being. Conversely, interventions targeting social safety nets, education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability demonstrably contribute to improved life satisfaction, reduced poverty, and enhanced social cohesion.  However, the effectiveness of such policies is contingent upon factors such as institutional capacity, political will, and the specific socio-economic context.  The review concludes that a holistic approach, integrating economic goals with social objectives, is essential for achieving sustainable and equitable improvements in social well-being.  Future research should focus on rigorous empirical evaluations of specific policy interventions and their long-term impacts across diverse populations, accounting for both intended and unintended consequences.
