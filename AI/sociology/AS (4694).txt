Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, characterized by both homogenization and hybridization. This review examines the extensive literature exploring this dynamic interplay. While globalization fosters the spread of globalized cultural products and consumption patterns, potentially leading to cultural erosion and the dominance of Western influences (e.g., through media and fast food), evidence suggests a more nuanced reality.  Many studies highlight the resilience of local cultures, demonstrating their capacity for adaptation and negotiation with global forces.  Processes of glocalization, where global trends are adapted to local contexts, are frequently observed, leading to the creation of hybrid cultural forms.  However, the uneven distribution of globalization's effects raises concerns about cultural inequality and the marginalization of less powerful cultures.  Further research is needed to fully understand the long-term consequences of this ongoing interaction, focusing on the agency of local communities in shaping their own cultural futures and mitigating the potentially negative impacts of globalization's uneven distribution of benefits.  This necessitates an interdisciplinary approach incorporating perspectives from anthropology, sociology, and cultural studies.
