Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have long been a catalyst for societal transformation.  This paper examines the multifaceted role of social movements in instigating and shaping societal change, focusing on recent developments that challenge established theoretical frameworks.  While classic theories emphasized resource mobilization and political opportunity structures as primary drivers, contemporary scholarship increasingly highlights the significance of digital technologies, transnational networks, and the rise of identity politics in shaping movement dynamics and outcomes.  The proliferation of online platforms has fostered rapid mobilization, broadened participation, and facilitated the dissemination of information and counter-narratives, profoundly impacting the scale and reach of social movements.  Simultaneously, the increasing interconnectedness of global civil society has enabled transnational solidarity and coordination, generating cross-border movements challenging global inequalities and corporate power.  This study will analyze these recent trends, exploring how they affect the efficacy, longevity, and overall impact of social movements in achieving substantive societal change, considering both successful examples and instances of limitations and setbacks.  We argue that a nuanced understanding of these evolving dynamics is crucial for comprehending the ongoing reshaping of political landscapes and societal norms.
