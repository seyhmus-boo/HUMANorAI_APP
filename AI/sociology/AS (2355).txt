Education plays a pivotal role in shaping societal norms, acting as both a reflector and a shaper of prevailing values and beliefs. This presentation examines the multifaceted ways in which educational systems influence the development and transmission of social norms.  We argue that formal curricula, pedagogical approaches, and the hidden curriculum – encompassing the unspoken rules and expectations within educational settings – all contribute significantly to norm formation.  The presentation will explore how education can reinforce existing social norms, potentially perpetuating inequalities and biases embedded within society. Conversely, it will analyze the potential of education to challenge and transform harmful norms, promoting social justice and equity through critical pedagogy and inclusive curriculum design.  We will draw upon existing literature in sociology of education and social psychology to illustrate these dynamics, using case studies to highlight the impact of specific educational interventions on social norm change.  The presentation concludes by considering the implications for educational policy and practice, advocating for a more proactive and critical approach to education's role in fostering positive social change and challenging discriminatory norms.
