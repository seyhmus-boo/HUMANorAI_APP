Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, characterized by both homogenization and hybridization.  This paper theorizes that the dominant narrative of cultural homogenization, driven by the global spread of Westernized media and consumerism, overlooks the significant role of cultural resilience and adaptation. While globalization facilitates the dissemination of global cultural products, leading to potential cultural erosion through the adoption of dominant cultural norms and practices, it simultaneously creates opportunities for local cultures to engage in selective appropriation and creative reinterpretation.  This process of hybridization results in novel cultural forms that blend global and local elements, demonstrating a dynamic interplay between global forces and localized agency. The extent of cultural homogenization or hybridization is contingent upon factors such as the strength of pre-existing cultural institutions, the level of economic integration, and the nature of global cultural flows. Ultimately, globalizationâ€™s effect on local cultures is not a unidirectional process of assimilation, but rather a complex negotiation between global influences and enduring local identities.
