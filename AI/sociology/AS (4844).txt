This paper explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth alone is insufficient to guarantee societal progress.  We posit that effective economic policies must explicitly consider their distributional consequences and impact on a range of social indicators beyond GDP per capita.  Policies promoting inclusive growth, such as investments in education, healthcare, and social safety nets, are shown to positively correlate with enhanced social well-being, measured by metrics like life expectancy, educational attainment, and social cohesion. Conversely, policies prioritizing austerity or deregulation without adequate social safeguards may lead to increased inequality and social unrest, ultimately undermining long-term economic stability.  The paper utilizes a comparative analysis of different policy approaches across various nations to demonstrate that a holistic framework integrating economic and social objectives is crucial for achieving sustainable and equitable development, resulting in improved societal well-being for all citizens.  Further research is needed to quantify the optimal balance between economic growth and social investment for maximized social well-being.
