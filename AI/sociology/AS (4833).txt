This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of rapid urbanization on community life, focusing on recent developments in social cohesion and spatial organization.  While urbanization offers economic opportunities and improved infrastructure, it simultaneously presents challenges to established social structures and community bonds.  Recent research highlights a growing disparity between the idealized image of vibrant, diverse urban communities and the realities experienced by many residents, particularly marginalized groups.  We will explore the implications of increasing residential mobility, the fragmentation of public spaces, and the rise of digital communication on community formation and engagement.  Specific attention will be paid to emerging trends such as the proliferation of gated communities, the influence of gentrification on social equity, and the potential of community-led initiatives to foster social capital in rapidly changing urban landscapes.  The presentation will conclude by considering policy implications, suggesting strategies for promoting inclusive and resilient communities in the face of ongoing urbanization.  Empirical examples from recent studies across diverse global contexts will be used to illustrate key arguments.
