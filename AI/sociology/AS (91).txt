This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a purely growth-focused approach is insufficient for achieving genuine societal progress. We posit that the economy is not a separate entity, but rather a circulatory system within the body politic.  Just as a healthy heart requires balanced blood pressure and efficient oxygen transport, a thriving society needs economic policies that distribute resources equitably and address social determinants of health.

We will use the analogy of a garden to illustrate this point.  Economic growth is akin to the yield of a garden â€“ it's important, but not the sole measure of success.  Ignoring the soil health (social equity, infrastructure), pest control (crime, inequality), and water management (resource allocation) will eventually lead to diminished yields, even if the initial growth is impressive.  Similarly, policies focused solely on GDP growth without considering factors like education, healthcare, and environmental sustainability are akin to maximizing yield at the expense of long-term soil fertility and overall garden health.

The presentation will analyze various economic policy approaches through this lens, showcasing how policies addressing income inequality, access to essential services, and environmental protection contribute to a more robust and resilient social ecosystem, ultimately fostering greater social well-being. We argue that a holistic approach, encompassing both economic prosperity and social justice, is crucial for achieving sustainable and equitable societal development.
