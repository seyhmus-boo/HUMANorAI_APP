Globalization, characterized by intensified interconnectedness and interdependence across national borders, has profoundly impacted local cultures worldwide.  While its economic and political dimensions have been extensively studied, the nuanced effects on cultural landscapes remain a subject of ongoing debate. This paper examines the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, focusing on recent developments in the 21st century.  The accelerating speed of information flow through digital technologies, particularly social media and the internet, presents a novel context for cultural exchange and homogenization.  While globalization fosters the dissemination of globalized cultural products and practices, leading to concerns about cultural imperialism and loss of traditional values, it also facilitates the resurgence and adaptation of local cultural expressions in response to global trends.  We analyze this complex interplay, considering both the homogenizing and heterogenizing effects of globalization.  Recent scholarship highlights the importance of hybridity and the emergence of "glocalization" – the adaptation of global trends to local contexts – as crucial aspects of contemporary cultural dynamics.  This research aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the ongoing negotiation between global forces and local cultural resilience in the face of rapid change.
