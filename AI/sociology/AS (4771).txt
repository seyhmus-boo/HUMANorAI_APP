This presentation explores the impact of globalization on local cultures through the lens of quantum mechanics, proposing a framework beyond traditional sociological analyses.  Globalization, we argue, can be viewed as a complex, entangled system, where individual cultural elements (qubits) interact and influence each other across vast geographical distances.  These interactions, driven by information exchange and economic interdependence, induce superposition states, representing the coexistence of global and local cultural expressions.  However, the process is not merely additive; rather, it exhibits quantum-like phenomena.  Measurement, in this context, represents the observation of cultural practices, leading to decoherence and a collapse of the superposition into a specific observable state â€“ a potentially homogenized or hybridized cultural outcome. We will examine specific case studies, illustrating how globalization-induced entanglement leads to both the preservation of unique cultural traits (entanglement robustness) and their erosion (decoherence). Furthermore, we will discuss the implications of this framework for understanding cultural resilience and the potential for quantum-inspired strategies to protect cultural diversity in an increasingly interconnected world.  The presentation will conclude by outlining avenues for future research, focusing on the development of quantitative models for assessing cultural entanglement and decoherence.
