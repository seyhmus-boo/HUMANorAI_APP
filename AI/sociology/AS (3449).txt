Cultural diversity, while enriching societies, presents challenges to social integration. This study examines the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, focusing on the mediating roles of intergroup contact and social cohesion.  Data from [Specify data source, e.g., a national survey of X individuals in Y country] were analyzed using [Specify statistical method, e.g., structural equation modeling] to investigate the direct and indirect effects of cultural diversity on social integration. Results indicate a complex interplay: while higher levels of cultural diversity were not directly associated with lower social integration, this relationship was significantly mediated by both the quality and quantity of intergroup contact. Positive intergroup contact, characterized by frequent interactions and positive attitudes, significantly strengthened social integration, even in highly diverse contexts. Conversely, limited or negative intergroup contact exacerbated the challenges posed by diversity, potentially hindering social cohesion.  These findings underscore the crucial role of fostering positive intergroup relations and implementing policies promoting inclusive environments to effectively manage the complexities of cultural diversity and achieve successful social integration. Future research should explore the specific contextual factors influencing the nature and effectiveness of intergroup contact.
