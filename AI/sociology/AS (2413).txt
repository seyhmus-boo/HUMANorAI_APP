Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies throughout history, remains a significant impediment to social progress and equitable development.  From ancient civilizations characterized by rigid caste systems to the feudal hierarchies of medieval Europe and the industrial-era disparities between burgeoning capital and a nascent working class, the unequal distribution of resources and opportunities has consistently shaped social structures and fostered widespread discontent. While the forms and manifestations of class inequality have evolved alongside societal transformations, its underlying mechanisms—power imbalances, differential access to education and healthcare, and skewed distribution of wealth and income—persist. This research paper explores the multifaceted effects of class inequality on contemporary society, moving beyond a simplistic understanding of economic disparities to examine its broader impacts on social cohesion, political stability, and individual well-being.  We will analyze the perpetuation of inequality through intergenerational transmission of advantage and disadvantage, the role of institutional structures in reinforcing class divisions, and the consequences for health, education, and social mobility.  Ultimately, the paper argues that addressing class inequality requires a multi-pronged approach encompassing both structural reforms and targeted interventions aimed at fostering greater equity and social justice.
