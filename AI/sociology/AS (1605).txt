The pervasive influence of social media on human behavior is a subject of growing scholarly concern. This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of these platforms, focusing on three key areas.  Firstly, social comparison theory suggests that constant exposure to curated online personas fosters feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem, particularly among vulnerable populations.  Secondly, the addictive nature of social media, driven by reward mechanisms embedded in app design, contributes to decreased attention spans and impaired cognitive function.  This is compounded by the propagation of misinformation and echo chambers, which can polarize opinions and hinder critical thinking.  Finally, the blurred lines between online and offline identities lead to concerns regarding authenticity and mental wellbeing. While social media offers undeniable benefits in terms of connectivity and information dissemination, its negative consequences on self-perception, cognitive abilities, and social dynamics warrant further investigation and strategic mitigation. Future research should explore the development of media literacy programs and the implementation of ethical design principles to mitigate the detrimental effects of social media on human behavior.
