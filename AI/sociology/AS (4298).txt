This abstract proposes a novel framework for understanding class inequality through the lens of quantum mechanical principles.  We posit that societal stratification, analogous to a many-body quantum system, exhibits emergent properties arising from complex interactions between individual "particles" (individuals) and their respective socio-economic "potentials."  The inherent uncertainty principle, applied metaphorically, highlights the unpredictable nature of social mobility and the limitations of deterministic models in predicting individual trajectories within the class structure.  Entanglement, representing interconnectedness between individuals through social networks and institutions, influences the overall system's behavior and reinforces existing inequalities.  Class distinctions, akin to distinct energy levels in a quantum system, create energetic barriers to transition between strata, resulting in a non-uniform distribution of resources and opportunities.  This unequal distribution can be modeled using concepts such as Fermi-Dirac statistics, where the "occupation probability" of higher social strata is significantly lower for individuals originating from lower ones.  Further research will explore the implications of quantum field theory in analyzing collective action and social change as fluctuations within this complex societal quantum system.  This framework promises a novel perspective on analyzing the persistent and pervasive nature of class inequality.
