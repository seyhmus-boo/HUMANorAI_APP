Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, transcends purely economic dimensions.  Its effects ripple across disciplines, impacting health, education, and political participation. Sociologists highlight the correlation between socioeconomic status and life expectancy, demonstrating how poverty and lack of access to quality healthcare contribute to disparate health outcomes.  Educational attainment, a key determinant of future earning potential, is heavily influenced by class.  Researchers in education consistently show how disadvantaged backgrounds limit access to resources and opportunities, perpetuating the cycle of inequality.  Furthermore, political science reveals the unequal influence of different classes on policy-making, with wealthier groups wielding disproportionate power.  Psychology contributes by examining the psychological effects of poverty and social stratification, including increased stress and reduced well-being.  Understanding class inequality thus requires an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from sociology, economics, education, political science, and psychology to effectively address its multifaceted consequences and develop comprehensive solutions.
