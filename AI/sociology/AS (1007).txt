This review examines the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, analyzing the extent to which macroeconomic strategies influence societal outcomes beyond mere economic growth.  While traditional economic models prioritize GDP growth, a growing body of literature highlights the limitations of this narrow focus.  The review synthesizes evidence demonstrating that policies prioritizing income inequality reduction, robust social safety nets, and investment in human capital (education, healthcare) demonstrably improve various dimensions of social well-being, including health, education attainment, and life satisfaction.  Conversely, austerity measures and neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and privatization are often associated with increased inequality and diminished social well-being, despite potential short-term economic gains.  However, the review also acknowledges the contextual nature of these relationships, emphasizing the influence of institutional factors, cultural norms, and specific policy designs.  Further research is needed to refine causal linkages and develop more nuanced policy recommendations that effectively balance economic growth with broader societal goals, particularly in diverse geopolitical contexts.  The paper concludes by advocating for a more holistic approach to economic policymaking that integrates social well-being as a central objective.
