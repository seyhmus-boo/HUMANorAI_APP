The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being constitutes a persistent and multifaceted area of inquiry, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to fully comprehend its complexities.  This paper investigates the multifaceted connections between macroeconomic strategies and various dimensions of social well-being, moving beyond a purely economic lens to incorporate sociological, psychological, and political science perspectives.  While traditional economic models often prioritize GDP growth as the primary indicator of societal progress, this research argues for a more nuanced understanding that accounts for factors such as health outcomes, social inequality, environmental sustainability, and subjective measures of happiness and life satisfaction.  We explore how different economic policy choices, including fiscal policy, monetary policy, and trade liberalization, differentially impact these diverse aspects of well-being, acknowledging the mediating roles of social structures, cultural norms, and political institutions. By drawing upon insights from diverse fields, this paper aims to contribute to a more holistic and comprehensive framework for evaluating the social impact of economic policies and informing the development of policies that genuinely promote human flourishing.
