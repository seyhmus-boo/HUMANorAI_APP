Historically, gender roles were largely prescribed by rigid societal structures, with distinct expectations for men and women rooted in patriarchal norms.  Men predominantly occupied positions of power and authority, while women were confined to domestic spheres.  This division of labor, deeply embedded in cultural and religious beliefs, persisted across various societies for centuries.

However, the 20th and 21st centuries have witnessed a significant evolution of gender roles, driven by several key factors.  The feminist movements challenged traditional hierarchies, advocating for equal rights and opportunities.  Simultaneously, industrialization and technological advancements altered economic structures, opening new professional avenues for women.  Increased education and literacy levels further empowered women to question and resist traditional constraints.

Despite considerable progress, complete gender equality remains elusive.  While overt sexism has declined in many contexts, subtle biases persist, influencing occupational choices, wage gaps, and representation in leadership positions.  The ongoing evolution of gender roles continues to be a complex and dynamic process, marked by both advancements and persistent challenges.
