This review examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change.  While diverse in their goals and tactics, social movements consistently demonstrate the capacity to challenge established power structures and effect significant transformations across various societal domains.  The analysis considers key theoretical frameworks, including resource mobilization theory and framing theory, highlighting their strengths and limitations in explaining movement success and impact.  Empirical evidence suggests a complex interplay between movement mobilization, political opportunity structures, and public opinion in shaping outcomes. While some movements achieve substantial policy changes and shifts in social norms, others experience repression or co-optation.  The review further explores the enduring legacies of successful movements, arguing that their impact extends beyond immediate policy gains, influencing long-term cultural values and political landscapes.  Future research should focus on understanding the evolving dynamics of digital activism and the increasingly transnational nature of social movements, as well as their intersection with broader processes of globalization and inequality.
