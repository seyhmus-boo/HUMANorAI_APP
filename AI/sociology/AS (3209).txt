This presentation explores the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change, highlighting the crucial contributions of interdisciplinary scholarship.  While traditionally studied through sociological lenses, understanding social movement efficacy requires integrating insights from diverse fields.  We examine how political science illuminates the strategic interactions between movements and state actors, demonstrating how framing, mobilization, and resource mobilization theories intersect with analyses of power dynamics and policy outcomes.  Furthermore, we analyze the crucial role of anthropological perspectives in understanding the cultural underpinnings of movements, revealing how shared identities, narratives, and rituals contribute to collective action and social transformation.  Economic analysis contributes by exploring the distributional consequences of movement successes and failures, highlighting the impact on wealth, inequality, and resource allocation.  Finally, we consider the psychological dimensions of movement participation, examining factors such as group identity, commitment, and the influence of social influence on individual agency.  By drawing on these interdisciplinary threads, we argue for a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of social movements as potent agents of both incremental and transformative societal change.
