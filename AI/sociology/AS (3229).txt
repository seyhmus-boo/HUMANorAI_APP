Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, continues to manifest in increasingly complex and nuanced ways. This presentation examines recent developments in understanding the multifaceted effects of class stratification on various societal outcomes.  We will move beyond traditional analyses of income disparity to encompass the growing influence of wealth inequality, intergenerational mobility stagnation, and the role of precarious employment in exacerbating existing inequalities.  Recent research highlights the detrimental impact of these factors on health outcomes, educational attainment, and political participation, demonstrating a widening gap in life chances between different social classes.  Furthermore, we will explore the implications of automation and globalization on the restructuring of labor markets and their contribution to increased inequality.  Finally, the presentation will briefly assess contemporary policy responses aimed at mitigating class inequality, critically evaluating their efficacy and proposing potential avenues for future research focusing on intersectionality and the creation of more equitable societal structures.  The ultimate aim is to foster a deeper understanding of this pervasive social issue and its far-reaching consequences.
