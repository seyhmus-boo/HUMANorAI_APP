Class inequality, a persistent societal feature, significantly impacts various societal aspects.  This paper theorizes that stratified class structures, characterized by unequal distribution of resources and opportunities, foster social instability and hinder overall societal progress.  The concentration of wealth and power within a dominant class limits upward mobility for lower classes, perpetuating cycles of poverty and disadvantage. This, in turn, can lead to increased crime rates, compromised public health outcomes, and diminished social cohesion, as evidenced by growing polarization and decreased inter-class interaction. Furthermore, unequal access to quality education and healthcare exacerbates existing disparities, reinforcing class divisions across generations.  The resulting social fragmentation undermines democratic principles and inhibits the effective functioning of societal institutions.  Addressing class inequality requires multifaceted interventions targeting economic redistribution, improved access to resources, and dismantling systemic barriers that perpetuate social stratification.  Further research should focus on exploring the dynamic interplay between specific inequality metrics and diverse societal outcomes.
