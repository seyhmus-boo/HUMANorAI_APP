Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances or aspirations, are pivotal agents of societal change.  Understanding their dynamics requires an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on insights from sociology, political science, history, and even psychology. Sociologists illuminate the mobilization processes, examining group formation, resource mobilization, and framing strategies employed by movements. Political scientists analyze the interaction between movements and the state, exploring tactics such as lobbying, protests, and civil disobedience and their impact on policy.  Historians provide crucial context, tracing the evolution of specific movements and identifying long-term consequences.  Crucially, psychological research helps us understand the individual motivations and beliefs that fuel collective action, including the role of identity and emotional engagement.  By integrating these perspectives, we gain a richer understanding of how social movements challenge existing power structures, shape public opinion, and ultimately contribute to significant social, political, and economic transformations.  The interdisciplinary lens reveals the multifaceted nature of these powerful forces for change.
