This presentation examines the evolving role of education in shaping social norms, focusing on recent developments in pedagogical theory and practice.  Traditional approaches emphasized transmission of knowledge and established norms, often reinforcing existing social hierarchies.  However, contemporary scholarship highlights education's capacity to foster critical thinking, challenge ingrained biases, and promote social change. We will explore the impact of inclusive curricula, focusing on diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, and their effectiveness in reshaping attitudes towards gender, race, sexuality, and other social categories. Recent research emphasizing experiential learning and participatory pedagogy will be discussed, demonstrating how these methods actively engage students in constructing their own understanding of social norms and challenging dominant narratives.  Furthermore, the influence of technology and digital platforms on disseminating alternative perspectives and fostering social dialogue within and beyond the classroom will be analyzed.  Finally, we will assess the limitations and potential pitfalls of educationâ€™s role in norm transformation, highlighting the need for ongoing critical reflection and evaluation to ensure genuine and sustainable social progress.  The presentation concludes by outlining key areas for future research and policy development.
