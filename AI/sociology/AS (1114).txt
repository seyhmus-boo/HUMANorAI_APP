This presentation examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change.  Focusing on a comparative analysis of [mention specific movements or types of movements, e.g.,  the Civil Rights Movement and the environmental justice movement], we explore the mechanisms through which collective action translates into tangible societal shifts.  The analysis will consider the interplay of various factors contributing to movement success, including framing strategies, resource mobilization, network structures, and the broader political context.  Specifically, we will investigate how movements leverage framing to resonate with public opinion and influence policy agendas, and how resource access impacts their organizational capacity and longevity.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the limitations and potential unintended consequences of social movements, acknowledging instances where mobilization has fallen short of stated goals or generated unforeseen negative outcomes.  Ultimately, this presentation aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between social movements and societal transformation, highlighting both the transformative potential and the inherent complexities of collective action in achieving social change.
