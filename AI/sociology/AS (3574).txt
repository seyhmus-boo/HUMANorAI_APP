Education, throughout history, has served as a powerful mechanism for both reinforcing and challenging existing social norms.  Historically, formal education systems frequently mirrored and perpetuated the dominant societal structures and values.  Medieval religious schools instilled theological norms, while colonial education systems often promoted assimilation and suppressed indigenous cultures.  This transmission of norms occurred not only through explicit curriculum, but also implicitly through pedagogical practices, school environments, and the selection of knowledge deemed worthy of transmission.

However, education has also played a crucial role in social change.  The Enlightenment, for example, saw educational reform aimed at disseminating reason and challenging traditional hierarchies.  Modern education increasingly incorporates critical thinking skills, encouraging students to question established norms and fostering social awareness.  Through civic education and the study of diverse perspectives, educational institutions can cultivate empathy and tolerance, potentially leading to shifts in social attitudes and behaviours.  Therefore, the relationship between education and social norms is complex and dynamic, capable of both conservation and transformation depending on its design and implementation.
