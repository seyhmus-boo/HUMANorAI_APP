This research explores the hitherto unexplored relationship between economic policies and social well-being through the lens of quantum mechanics.  We posit that societal well-being, rather than existing in a deterministic classical state, can be modeled as a superposition of multiple socio-economic states, each with a probability amplitude reflecting its relative contribution to overall well-being. Economic policies, then, act as operators, influencing the probability amplitudes of these states. We propose a novel framework leveraging the concepts of entanglement and decoherence to analyze the interconnectedness of various socio-economic factors (e.g., income inequality, healthcare access, education levels) and the disruptive effects of policy interventions.  Increased inequality, for example, could be interpreted as a decoherence process, reducing the coherence of the well-being superposition and resulting in a less desirable, more classically defined state.  Conversely, redistributive policies may function as entanglement-enhancing operators, fostering correlations between disparate socio-economic factors and thereby increasing the probability amplitude of higher well-being states.  Future work will focus on developing a quantitative model incorporating key economic variables and utilizing quantum computing to simulate the complex dynamics of policy impacts on social well-being.  This quantum approach provides a promising avenue for understanding the non-linear and emergent properties observed in socio-economic systems.
