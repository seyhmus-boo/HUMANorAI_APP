Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, significantly impacts various aspects of social life.  This lecture explores the multifaceted nature of class inequality, examining its root causes and cascading consequences.  We posit that unequal distribution of resources, stemming from historical and structural factors such as discriminatory policies and inherited wealth, fuels a cycle of disadvantage. This manifests in disparities across education, healthcare, and housing, resulting in diminished life chances for lower socioeconomic groups.  Further, the concentration of power in the hands of the affluent exacerbates inequality, limiting social mobility and perpetuating systemic injustice. The consequences extend beyond individual well-being, impacting social cohesion and contributing to increased crime rates, political instability, and ultimately, diminished societal well-being.  Addressing class inequality necessitates comprehensive strategies targeting economic redistribution, improved access to quality education and healthcare, and the dismantling of discriminatory practices.  Only through concerted and multifaceted interventions can societies hope to mitigate the detrimental effects of this pervasive societal ill.
