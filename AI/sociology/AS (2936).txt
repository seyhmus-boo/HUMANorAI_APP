Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on class inequality and its societal ramifications.  While class stratification has always existed, recent decades have witnessed a marked widening of the gap between the wealthy and the poor in many developed nations.  This inequality isn't merely a matter of differing incomes; it profoundly impacts societal well-being.

Studies consistently demonstrate a correlation between high levels of inequality and decreased social mobility, hindering individuals' ability to improve their socioeconomic status regardless of merit. This fuels resentment and social unrest, manifested in political polarization and a decline in social cohesion.  Furthermore, increased inequality correlates with poorer health outcomes across various demographics, from higher rates of chronic disease to lower life expectancy among lower-income groups.  Recent research highlights the role of automation and globalization in exacerbating this trend, while stagnant wages and the increasing cost of living further solidify the challenges faced by those in lower socioeconomic brackets.  Addressing this multifaceted issue requires comprehensive policies that focus on equitable income distribution, accessible education, and robust social safety nets.
