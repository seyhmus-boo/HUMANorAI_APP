Social media's pervasive influence on human behavior is a subject of increasing scholarly concern. This lecture explores the multifaceted impact of these platforms, focusing on three key areas. Firstly, the curated nature of online identities fosters social comparison and potentially contributes to anxiety and depression, particularly amongst vulnerable populations. Secondly, the algorithmic design of social media platforms, designed to maximize engagement, can lead to addiction and compulsive usage, impacting real-world social interactions and productivity.  Thirdly, the rapid dissemination of information, both factual and misleading, through social media networks significantly influences public opinion and political discourse, potentially contributing to the spread of misinformation and polarization. This lecture argues that understanding the psychological mechanisms driving these behavioral shifts is crucial for mitigating the negative consequences of social media while leveraging its potential benefits. Future research should focus on developing strategies to promote responsible social media usage and foster media literacy.
