Education plays a crucial role in shaping social norms, influencing individual attitudes and behaviors that collectively constitute societal expectations. This paper explores the interdisciplinary links between education, sociology, psychology, and anthropology to understand this complex interplay.  Educational institutions act as socializing agents, transmitting cultural values, beliefs, and acceptable conduct through formal curricula and informal interactions.  Sociological perspectives highlight the role of education in reinforcing social stratification and perpetuating existing norms, while also identifying its potential for social mobility and norm change.  Psychological research elucidates the cognitive mechanisms through which education impacts attitudes, emphasizing the influence of learning, persuasion, and social modeling on norm internalization.  Anthropological studies contribute by examining the diversity of social norms across cultures and the varying effectiveness of educational approaches in different societal contexts.  This review argues that a multi-faceted approach, incorporating insights from these disciplines, is essential for understanding how education both reflects and reshapes social norms.  Future research should focus on investigating the effectiveness of educational interventions designed to promote positive social change, particularly in addressing inequalities and fostering inclusive norms.
