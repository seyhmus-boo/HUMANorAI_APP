The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, historically demonstrated by contrasting approaches.  Early laissez-faire capitalism, prevalent from the 18th to the late 19th centuries, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention, often resulting in significant social inequalities and periodic crises.  This period saw the rise of social movements advocating for welfare reforms, highlighting the limitations of prioritizing purely economic metrics.

The 20th century witnessed the emergence of Keynesian economics, emphasizing government intervention to manage aggregate demand and mitigate economic fluctuations, aiming to improve social well-being through full employment and social safety nets.  However, the latter half of the century saw criticisms of Keynesianism, focusing on issues like inflation and the potential for excessive government bureaucracy.  Neoliberal policies, emphasizing deregulation and privatization, gained prominence from the 1980s onwards, with proponents arguing these stimulated growth ultimately benefiting society.  Yet, critiques highlight increased inequality and social fragmentation as potential downsides.

Currently, the debate centers on finding a balance.  While economic growth remains crucial, its impact on social well-being – encompassing health, education, and environmental sustainability – is increasingly recognized as a primary policy concern.  Measuring social well-being beyond purely economic indicators, and integrating social considerations into economic policy design, are central challenges for contemporary policymakers.
