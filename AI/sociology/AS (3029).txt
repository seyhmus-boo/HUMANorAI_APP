This review examines the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms.  Existing literature suggests a strong correlation between educational attainment and the internalization of prosocial norms, encompassing aspects like civic engagement, gender equality, and environmental responsibility.  Educational institutions, through formal curricula and informal socialization processes, transmit societal values and expectations, influencing individual beliefs and behaviors.  However, the relationship is complex and not unidirectional.  While education can promote positive norm change, it can also reinforce existing inequalities or perpetuate harmful norms if curricula and pedagogy are not critically examined.  Studies highlight the significance of pedagogical approaches that foster critical thinking, empathy, and intercultural understanding in promoting positive norm shifts.  Further research should investigate the differential effects of various educational settings and approaches across diverse populations, considering factors such as socioeconomic status and cultural context.  Understanding these nuances is crucial for designing effective educational interventions aimed at fostering positive social change through the cultivation of desirable societal norms.  Future studies should also explore the long-term impacts of educational interventions on norm internalization and behavioral outcomes.
