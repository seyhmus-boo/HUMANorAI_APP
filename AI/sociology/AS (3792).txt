Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding.  Economically, unequal distribution of wealth and resources fuels poverty, limiting access to education, healthcare, and social mobility.  This, in turn, exacerbates existing inequalities, as demonstrated by sociological studies revealing the perpetuation of disadvantage across generations.  Psychologically, chronic stress associated with economic insecurity contributes to poorer mental health outcomes amongst lower socioeconomic groups, impacting individual well-being and societal productivity.  Furthermore, political science reveals how class disparities influence political participation and representation, potentially leading to policies that further entrench inequality.  Finally, historical analysis illuminates the long-term consequences of past policies and social structures on contemporary class divisions, highlighting the enduring impact of historical injustices on present-day inequality.  Addressing this multifaceted issue requires collaboration across disciplines to develop effective and holistic solutions.
