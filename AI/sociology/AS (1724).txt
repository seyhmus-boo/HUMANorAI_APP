Social movements, defined as collective actions driven by shared grievances and aimed at effecting societal change, play a crucial role in shaping political landscapes and cultural norms.  Recent developments highlight a shift towards increasingly decentralized and digitally-mediated mobilization strategies.  While traditional movements relied heavily on hierarchical structures and physical gatherings, contemporary movements leverage social media platforms to facilitate rapid information dissemination, coordinate protests, and build transnational solidarity networks. This digital turn has enabled the emergence of  “flash mobs” and online activism, bypassing traditional gatekeepers and challenging established power structures in novel ways.  However, this reliance on digital technologies also presents challenges, including the spread of misinformation, algorithmic bias impacting reach, and the potential for online harassment and surveillance.  Furthermore, the success of contemporary movements is often contingent upon the ability to translate online mobilization into tangible offline action and to build broad-based coalitions capable of sustaining momentum over time.  Analyzing these recent developments necessitates a nuanced understanding of both the empowering potential and inherent limitations of digital tools within the broader context of power dynamics and societal structures.
