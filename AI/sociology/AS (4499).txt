Class inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across social strata, profoundly impacts societal structures and individual well-being.  Its effects manifest across multiple dimensions.  Economically, it fuels wealth concentration, hindering economic mobility and generating systemic poverty.  This disproportionately affects marginalized groups, perpetuating cycles of disadvantage.  Socially, inequality fosters stratification, creating distinct cultural and behavioral patterns among classes, often resulting in social segregation and reduced social cohesion.  Politically, it translates into unequal access to power and influence, undermining democratic principles and leading to policy biases favoring dominant groups.  Furthermore, studies demonstrate a strong correlation between high levels of inequality and increased crime rates, poor health outcomes (both physical and mental), and lower levels of social trust.  Practical applications of this understanding include progressive taxation, strengthening social safety nets (universal basic income, affordable healthcare), investing in quality education, and promoting policies that address discriminatory practices in hiring, housing, and the justice system.  Addressing class inequality requires a multi-pronged approach, encompassing economic redistribution, social inclusion initiatives, and political reforms aimed at fostering a more equitable society.
