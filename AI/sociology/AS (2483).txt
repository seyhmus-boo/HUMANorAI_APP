Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, profoundly impacts various aspects of social life. This presentation examines the multifaceted effects of class stratification, moving beyond simplistic economic disparities to explore its influence on health, education, political participation, and social cohesion.  We posit that class inequality operates not only through direct resource limitations but also through indirect mechanisms such as social exclusion, reduced social mobility, and the perpetuation of discriminatory practices.  Drawing on sociological and economic literature, we analyze empirical evidence illustrating the correlation between class inequality and disparities in life expectancy, educational attainment, political representation, and crime rates.  Furthermore, we discuss the societal consequences of heightened inequality, including increased social unrest, decreased trust in institutions, and a widening gap between the experiences of different social groups.  The presentation concludes by briefly exploring potential policy interventions aimed at mitigating class inequality and fostering a more equitable and just society, focusing on the need for comprehensive strategies addressing both the causes and consequences of this pervasive social problem.
