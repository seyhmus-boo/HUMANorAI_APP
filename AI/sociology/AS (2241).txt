Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and reinforcing societal norms, acting as a crucial agent of socialization alongside family and media.  Formal curricula explicitly transmit values, beliefs, and behaviors deemed desirable by a particular society, fostering a shared understanding of acceptable conduct.  However, the influence extends beyond explicit instruction; the hidden curriculum, encompassing school culture, interactions with peers, and disciplinary practices, subtly shapes attitudes and behaviors. Recent developments highlight a growing awareness of the limitations of traditional approaches.  Critiques of Eurocentric biases in historical narratives and the perpetuation of gender stereotypes within educational materials have spurred efforts towards inclusive and equitable curricula, aiming to dismantle oppressive norms and promote social justice.  Furthermore, the rise of online learning and diverse educational platforms offers opportunities to challenge geographical and social barriers to accessing alternative perspectives and fostering global citizenship.  Simultaneously, research into implicit bias in teacher-student interactions and assessment methods underscores the ongoing need for critical self-reflection within the educational community to ensure that the transmission of norms actively promotes equality and positive social change rather than inadvertently reinforcing existing inequalities.
