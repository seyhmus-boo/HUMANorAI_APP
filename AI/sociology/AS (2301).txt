This paper investigates the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simplistic correlation to explore nuanced causal relationships. We argue that a narrow focus on traditional macroeconomic indicators, such as GDP growth, fails to capture the multifaceted nature of social well-being, which encompasses dimensions like health, education, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion.  The study employs a comparative case study approach, analyzing the contrasting experiences of two or more countries with differing economic policy orientations. This allows for a detailed examination of how policies such as fiscal redistribution, social safety nets, labor market regulation, and environmental protection impact various aspects of societal well-being.  Preliminary findings suggest that while economic growth is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for enhanced social well-being, the *type* of economic growth and the distributional effects of economic policies are crucial determinants.  Furthermore, the study highlights the importance of considering long-term sustainability alongside short-term economic gains when evaluating the overall impact of economic policies on social well-being.  The paper concludes by advocating for a more holistic approach to policymaking, integrating social and environmental considerations into economic policy design for achieving sustainable and equitable societal development.
