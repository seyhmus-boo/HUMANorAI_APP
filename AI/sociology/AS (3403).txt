This presentation explores the experimental challenges inherent in researching the impact of globalization on local cultures.  While globalization's effects are widely discussed, rigorously establishing causal links between global processes and cultural shifts remains a significant methodological hurdle.  We argue that traditional ethnographic approaches, while valuable, often lack the experimental control needed to isolate the influence of globalization from other confounding factors, such as internal social dynamics or technological advancements.  

This presentation will discuss three key experimental challenges: (1) the difficulty in defining and operationalizing "globalization" itself, leading to inconsistent measurement across studies; (2) the ethical complexities of manipulating global influences in a controlled setting, particularly concerning vulnerable communities; and (3) the inherent heterogeneity of local cultures, requiring nuanced case-by-case analyses which hinder the generalizability of findings from smaller-scale experiments.  Finally, we propose a multi-method approach, integrating quantitative surveys with qualitative ethnographic research and potentially leveraging natural experiments arising from uneven exposure to globalization, as a means to address these challenges and enhance the robustness of future research in this crucial area.
