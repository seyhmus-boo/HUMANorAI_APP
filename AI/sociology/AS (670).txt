Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, exerts profound and multifaceted effects across various dimensions of human life, necessitating an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding. This abstract explores the interconnectedness of economic disparities with social, political, and health outcomes.  Economic inequality, measured by Gini coefficients and wealth distribution analysis, correlates strongly with reduced social mobility, hindering individual advancement and perpetuating intergenerational disadvantage.  Sociological studies highlight the impact on social cohesion, demonstrating increased crime rates and political polarization in societies with high levels of inequality.  Furthermore, epidemiological research reveals a robust link between socioeconomic status and health disparities, manifested in higher morbidity and mortality rates among lower socioeconomic groups.  Political science illuminates how concentrated wealth influences policy decisions, often benefiting the affluent while exacerbating inequality.  A truly effective response demands integration of economic modelling, sociological insights into social stratification, epidemiological data on health outcomes, and political analysis of policy formation. Future research should focus on developing interdisciplinary frameworks to identify effective interventions targeting the root causes of class inequality and mitigating its detrimental societal consequences.
