Social movements, defined as collective actions pursuing social or political change outside established institutional channels, play a crucial role in driving societal transformation. This paper examines the multifaceted influence of social movements, analyzing their capacity to challenge dominant power structures and engender significant alterations in norms, values, and policy.  The efficacy of a movement hinges on several factors, including the framing of grievances, mobilization strategies, and the presence of enabling political opportunities.  Resource mobilization theory highlights the importance of access to resources such as funding, media attention, and organizational infrastructure, while political process theory emphasizes the role of political context and opportunities in shaping movement success.  Furthermore, the paper explores the diverse outcomes of social movements, ranging from incremental policy changes to radical societal shifts.  While some movements achieve their stated goals, others may lead to unintended consequences or fail to achieve significant impact.  Analyzing the interplay between movement strategies, political contexts, and broader societal structures is essential to understanding the complex relationship between social movements and societal change. Future research should focus on comparative case studies analyzing the differential impacts of various movement types across diverse political landscapes.
