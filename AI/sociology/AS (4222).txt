This review examines the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, exploring the extent to which macroeconomic strategies impact societal outcomes beyond GDP growth.  A significant body of literature highlights the limitations of solely GDP-focused policies, arguing for a more nuanced approach encompassing broader social indicators.  While policies aimed at stimulating economic growth (e.g., tax cuts, deregulation) can positively influence employment and income, their effects on social well-being are often unevenly distributed, exacerbating existing inequalities.  Conversely, social safety nets and investment in human capital (education, healthcare) demonstrably improve social well-being but may incur short-term economic costs.  The review identifies a crucial need for integrated policy frameworks that consider both economic efficiency and social equity.  This involves incorporating metrics beyond GDP, such as health, education attainment, and income distribution, into policy evaluation.  Further research is required to quantitatively assess the long-term trade-offs between economic growth and social progress, informing the development of more holistic and sustainable policy approaches.  Ultimately, achieving genuine social well-being necessitates moving beyond a purely economic paradigm towards a more multidimensional and socially inclusive perspective on policy formulation.
