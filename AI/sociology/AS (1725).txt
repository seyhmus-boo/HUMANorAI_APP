Education plays a pivotal role in shaping social norms, acting as a powerful agent of both socialization and social change.  Recent research highlights the complex and multifaceted nature of this relationship, moving beyond simplistic transmission models.  Studies employing longitudinal designs and incorporating diverse methodologies, including agent-based modeling and network analysis, reveal education's influence extends beyond the explicit curriculum.  Exposure to diverse perspectives within educational settings fosters critical thinking and challenges pre-existing norms, particularly concerning gender roles, intergroup relations, and environmental sustainability.  Furthermore, educational attainment correlates with increased prosocial behaviors and adherence to norms promoting collective well-being, although this relationship is often mediated by factors like socioeconomic status and access to quality education.  Emerging scholarship emphasizes the importance of pedagogy and curriculum design in actively promoting norm change, with evidence suggesting that participatory and experiential learning approaches are particularly effective in fostering internalized, rather than merely compliant, normative adherence.  Future research should focus on understanding the differential impact of educational interventions across diverse contexts and populations to further refine strategies for leveraging education's potential in shaping positive social norms.
