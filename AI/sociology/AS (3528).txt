Social media's impact on human behavior is a burgeoning area of research, tracing its roots to the early adoption of online communication technologies.  Initially conceived as tools for enhanced connectivity, platforms like Facebook and Twitter have profoundly altered social interaction, information dissemination, and individual psychology. This abstract reviews the evolving understanding of these impacts.  Early research focused on the formation of online communities and the potential for social capital growth. However, contemporary studies increasingly highlight negative consequences, including increased levels of social comparison, cyberbullying, and the spread of misinformation.  The addictive nature of social media, fueled by reward mechanisms embedded in platform design, contributes to decreased attention spans and heightened anxiety. Moreover, filter bubbles and echo chambers fostered by algorithmic curation limit exposure to diverse perspectives, potentially exacerbating political polarization and societal divisions.  Future research must consider the complex interplay between individual predispositions, platform design, and societal contexts to fully elucidate the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, including the development of effective mitigation strategies.
