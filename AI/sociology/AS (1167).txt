The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, demanding an interdisciplinary approach that transcends purely economic analyses.  While traditional economics focuses on aggregate measures like GDP, a comprehensive understanding requires integrating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science.  For instance, neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and privatization, while potentially boosting economic growth, may exacerbate social inequalities if not accompanied by robust social safety nets, as evidenced by rising income disparity in many developed nations (Piketty, 2014).  Conversely, social policies like universal basic income, informed by behavioural economics and sociological understandings of poverty traps, aim to directly enhance well-being by mitigating economic insecurity.  Political science contributes by analyzing the distributional effects of policies and the influence of power dynamics on policy implementation, highlighting the role of lobbying and political ideologies in shaping outcomes.  Ultimately, a holistic assessment necessitates moving beyond solely economic indicators towards multi-dimensional measures of well-being, encompassing factors such as health, education, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability, acknowledging the intricate interplay between economic systems and societal structures.  Ignoring these interdisciplinary connections risks designing policies with unintended and potentially harmful social consequences.
