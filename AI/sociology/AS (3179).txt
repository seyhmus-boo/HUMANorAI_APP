Class inequality, a persistent societal feature, transcends disciplinary boundaries, impacting social, economic, and psychological well-being.  Sociological analyses reveal its manifestation in unequal access to resources, opportunities, and power, often reinforced through inherited privilege and systemic discrimination.  Economic theories highlight the detrimental effects on productivity and aggregate demand, as a large segment of the population lacks sufficient disposable income to stimulate economic growth.  Furthermore, psychological research demonstrates the negative correlation between socioeconomic status and mental health, with lower-class individuals experiencing higher rates of stress, anxiety, and depression stemming from chronic resource scarcity and social marginalization.  Critically, political science reveals how class inequality fuels political instability, contributing to social unrest and potentially undermining democratic processes. The interdisciplinary lens highlights the interconnectedness of these effects, demonstrating that addressing class inequality requires a holistic approach incorporating economic redistribution, social justice initiatives, and policies promoting mental health and civic engagement.
