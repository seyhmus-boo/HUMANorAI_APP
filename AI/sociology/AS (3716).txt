Class inequality, a persistent societal ill, transcends purely economic analysis.  Its multifaceted nature necessitates an interdisciplinary approach, drawing on sociology, economics, and political science, amongst others.  Economically, inequality manifests as unequal distribution of wealth and income, impacting consumption patterns, investment, and economic growth.  Sociologically, it shapes social mobility, access to education and healthcare, and perpetuates cycles of disadvantage through intergenerational transmission of poverty.  This leads to social stratification, manifested in distinct cultural practices, values, and social networks among different classes.  Politically, inequality can undermine democratic processes, as wealthier classes exert disproportionate influence on policy-making, potentially leading to policies that further entrench their advantages.  Furthermore, psychology contributes by highlighting the detrimental effects of inequality on individual well-being, including increased stress and reduced life expectancy, further exacerbating societal challenges.  Thus, understanding class inequality requires a holistic perspective, integrating various disciplines to grasp its complex and pervasive impact.
