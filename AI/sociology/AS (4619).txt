This presentation examines the pivotal role of education in shaping and reshaping social norms.  While often viewed as a transmitter of existing norms, education also possesses a transformative capacity.  We argue that formal and informal educational settings provide fertile ground for both the reinforcement of established social norms and the cultivation of new ones.  This is achieved through explicit curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the implicit socialization processes occurring within educational institutions.  The presentation will explore how curricula, teaching methodologies, and the broader school climate influence students' internalization of norms relating to gender, ethnicity, environmental responsibility, and civic engagement.  Drawing on relevant sociological and educational theories, we will analyze case studies illustrating both the positive and negative impacts of education on social norm development, including instances of both norm conformity and resistance.  Finally, we will discuss the implications for educational policy and practice, highlighting the necessity of critically examining curricula and pedagogy to foster inclusive and equitable social norms conducive to a just and sustainable society.  The presentation concludes by suggesting avenues for future research focusing on the efficacy of diverse educational interventions in promoting positive social change.
