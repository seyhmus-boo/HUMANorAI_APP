This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, moving beyond anecdotal evidence to examine empirically supported findings.  We will analyze how platforms leveraging social comparison, reward mechanisms, and algorithmic curation shape individual self-perception, interpersonal relationships, and collective action.  Specifically, the presentation will address the documented effects on mental health, including increased rates of anxiety and depression linked to cyberbullying, social pressure, and fear of missing out (FOMO). Conversely, we will also explore the positive aspects, such as facilitated social movements and increased access to information and support networks.

The presentation will further discuss the implications of these behavioral changes for various sectors.  For example, understanding the persuasive power of social media influencers is crucial for targeted marketing campaigns and public health initiatives.  Similarly, recognizing the potential for echo chambers and filter bubbles informs strategies for countering misinformation and promoting critical thinking. By examining both the detrimental and beneficial effects, this presentation aims to provide a nuanced understanding of social media's influence and offer practical applications for mitigating negative consequences and harnessing positive potential across diverse fields, including public health, marketing, and political science.
