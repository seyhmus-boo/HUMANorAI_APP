The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being demands an interdisciplinary approach, transcending the limitations of purely economic analysis.  While traditional economics focuses on aggregate measures like GDP, a holistic understanding necessitates incorporating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science.  Studies consistently demonstrate that purely growth-oriented policies, neglecting distributional effects and social safety nets, can exacerbate inequality and undermine well-being, as highlighted by research on the social costs of austerity measures.  Conversely, policies prioritizing social inclusion, such as universal basic income or robust social support systems, can demonstrably improve mental health, reduce crime rates, and foster social cohesion, as evidenced by sociological and psychological studies.  Furthermore, political science contributes by analyzing the political feasibility and implementation challenges of such policies, revealing the interplay between policy design, political power dynamics, and societal outcomes.  A truly effective approach, therefore, requires integrating economic models with sociological understanding of social capital and stratification, psychological insights into individual well-being, and political analysis of policy implementation. Only then can we move beyond simplistic correlations to formulate policies genuinely promoting inclusive and sustainable social well-being.
