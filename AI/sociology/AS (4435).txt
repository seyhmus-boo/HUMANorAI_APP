Cultural diversity, while enriching societies, presents challenges to social integration. This study examines the complex interplay between cultural diversity and social cohesion, analyzing its influence on various aspects of social life.  We hypothesize that higher levels of cultural diversity are associated with both increased social capital in some contexts (e.g., through cross-cultural interaction and exchange) and decreased social capital in others (e.g., through heightened intergroup anxiety and conflict).  Using a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative survey data from a diverse urban population (N=500) with qualitative interviews (n=30), we investigate the mediating roles of intergroup contact, prejudice, and perceived discrimination on social integration outcomes.  Results indicate a nuanced relationship, with positive effects of diversity mediated by positive intergroup contact characterized by empathy and understanding, while negative effects are mediated by prejudice and perceived discrimination.  Furthermore, qualitative data highlighted the crucial role of institutional support and inclusive policies in fostering social cohesion within diverse settings.  These findings underscore the need for targeted interventions promoting positive intergroup relations and addressing structural inequalities to enhance social integration in culturally diverse societies.
