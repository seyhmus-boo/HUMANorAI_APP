The accelerating pace of global urbanization presents a complex and multifaceted challenge to the fabric of community life.  While offering economic opportunities and improved access to services, rapid urban expansion frequently undermines established social structures and fosters feelings of alienation.  This paper examines the evolving relationship between urbanization and community, focusing on recent developments in the field.  Traditional notions of community, rooted in geographic proximity and shared experiences, are increasingly challenged by the diverse and often transient populations characterizing modern cities.  Recent research highlights the crucial role of digital technologies in both facilitating and disrupting community building, with online platforms offering new avenues for social interaction alongside concerns about digital divides and the erosion of face-to-face engagement.  Furthermore, the impact of gentrification, displacement, and unequal access to resources are exacerbating existing social inequalities and fracturing communities along economic and ethnic lines. This research explores these contemporary issues, analyzing empirical evidence to illuminate the specific ways in which urbanization reshapes social interaction, fosters or undermines social cohesion, and influences the well-being of urban residents.  We argue that a nuanced understanding of these dynamics is crucial for developing effective urban planning and social policies that promote vibrant and inclusive communities.
