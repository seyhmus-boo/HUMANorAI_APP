The evolution of gender roles in modern societies constitutes a complex and multifaceted phenomenon demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding. This research paper explores the shifting dynamics of gender expectations and performances across various societal sectors, drawing upon insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and economics.  While traditional gender roles, often rooted in biological determinism and cultural norms, have historically structured social interactions and power dynamics, contemporary societies witness significant, albeit uneven, transformations.  We examine the interplay between macro-level societal changes, such as legal reforms and technological advancements, and micro-level individual experiences, exploring how these factors intersect to shape evolving gender identities and expressions. The paper investigates the persistence of traditional gendered expectations in specific domains, like the workplace and family life, alongside the emergence of more fluid and diverse gender identities and expressions.  By integrating theoretical frameworks from multiple disciplines, this research aims to provide a nuanced analysis of the ongoing evolution of gender roles and its implications for social equity and individual well-being.  The limitations of existing unidimensional approaches will be addressed, highlighting the need for a more holistic, multi-faceted perspective.
