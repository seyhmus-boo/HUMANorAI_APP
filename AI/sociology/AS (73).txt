While seemingly disparate, the principles of quantum mechanics offer a compelling, albeit metaphorical, framework for understanding the pervasive effects of class inequality on society.  Just as quantum systems exist in superposition, individuals within a society are simultaneously influenced by multiple, interconnected factors determined by their socio-economic position. Their potential – analogous to a wave function – is significantly constrained by the "potential well" of their class, limiting accessible opportunities and trajectories.  High inequality deepens this well, creating stark differences in probability distributions for accessing resources like education, healthcare, and justice. This results in a system where certain "states" (e.g., high income, good health) become highly probable for individuals within privileged classes, while remaining low-probability states for those in disadvantaged classes, mirroring the energy level distributions of quantum particles in an uneven potential field. This "entanglement" of class with other social determinants creates a complex, interconnected web of consequences, manifesting as persistent disparities in health outcomes, social mobility, and political participation.  The resultant societal "wave function" – representing the overall state of the society – exhibits significant incoherence and instability, stemming from the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities governed by the class structure. Therefore, the reduction of class inequality can be viewed as a process of creating a more "uniform" potential field, allowing for a greater range of possible states and a more equitable probability distribution of societal outcomes for all individuals.
