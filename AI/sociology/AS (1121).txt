Globalization's pervasive influence on societies worldwide necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its multifaceted impact on local cultures. This research paper examines the complex interplay between globalization and the preservation or transformation of cultural identities, drawing on insights from anthropology, sociology, economics, and political science.  While globalization fosters interconnectedness and cultural exchange through technological advancements and economic integration, it simultaneously poses significant challenges to the authenticity and continuity of local traditions. This study explores the contrasting perspectives on globalization's effects, ranging from homogenization theories that predict the erosion of cultural diversity under the pressure of global capitalism, to hybridization theories which posit the emergence of new, hybrid cultural forms through the blending of global and local elements.  An interdisciplinary approach is crucial to adequately address the nuances of this multifaceted issue, considering economic forces shaping cultural consumption patterns, sociological analyses of social identity formation in a globalized world, anthropological perspectives on cultural adaptation and resistance, and the political implications of cultural preservation policies. By integrating these disciplinary lenses, this paper aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of globalization's impact on local cultures and the strategies employed for cultural resilience.
