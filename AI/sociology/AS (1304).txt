While seemingly disparate, economic policies and social well-being can be viewed through a quantum mechanical lens, focusing on the probabilistic nature of outcomes and the entanglement of various socio-economic factors.  Economic policies, analogous to wave functions, represent a superposition of potential societal states.  Implementation of a specific policy collapses this superposition, resulting in a specific, albeit probabilistic, social outcome.  The degree of social well-being, measurable through indices like the Gini coefficient or Human Development Index, becomes the observed value of this collapsed state.

The entanglement of factors like income inequality, access to healthcare, and education mirrors quantum entanglement.  Changes in one factor (e.g., implementing progressive taxation) will instantaneously influence the others, even if not directly targeted by the policy. This entanglement creates complex correlations difficult to predict classically, necessitating a probabilistic approach.  Further, the observer effect – the influence of measurement on the observed system – is crucial.  Policy evaluation itself can alter the trajectory of social well-being, highlighting the need for careful consideration of methodological biases.  The goal, therefore, is to design economic policies that maximize the probability of achieving a desired social well-being state, acknowledging the inherent uncertainties and interconnectedness of socio-economic variables.
