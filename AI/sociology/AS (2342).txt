Social norms, the unwritten rules governing social behaviour, are fundamental to societal cohesion and stability.  While often considered culturally ingrained and resistant to change, a growing body of research suggests a significant role for education in shaping and reshaping these norms. This paper explores the multifaceted interplay between education and social norm formation, drawing on insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and education studies to provide a comprehensive understanding of this dynamic relationship.  We argue that education acts not merely as a transmitter of existing norms but as a crucial agent of both norm creation and transformation.  This influence manifests through diverse mechanisms, including the curriculum's explicit and implicit messaging, the social interactions within educational settings, and the development of critical thinking and cognitive skills that enable individuals to challenge and revise pre-existing beliefs. By examining the educational system's capacity to foster prosocial behaviours, address prejudice, and promote inclusivity, this study aims to highlight the critical role of education in fostering positive social change and constructing more equitable and just societies.  The interdisciplinary lens employed here allows for a nuanced analysis, moving beyond simplistic causal explanations to illuminate the complex and evolving relationship between education and the social norms it both reflects and shapes.
