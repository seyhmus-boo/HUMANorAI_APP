This paper examines the complex and multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being, drawing upon insights from economics, sociology, and political science.  While traditional economic models often focus on aggregate measures like GDP, a comprehensive understanding necessitates incorporating broader social indicators.  We argue that the effectiveness of economic policies in enhancing social well-being depends critically on their distributional effects, considering factors such as income inequality, access to healthcare and education, and social safety nets.  Sociological perspectives illuminate how social capital, trust, and community cohesion mediate the impact of economic policies on individual and collective well-being.  Political science contributes by analyzing the political processes shaping policy design and implementation, including the influence of lobbying groups and power dynamics.  This interdisciplinary approach reveals that purely economic indicators are insufficient to capture the full impact of policy choices.  We contend that a holistic assessment, integrating economic outcomes with social and political factors, is crucial for evaluating the success of economic policies in achieving genuine social progress and fostering sustainable societal well-being. Future research should focus on developing more integrated methodologies capable of capturing these complex interactions.
