This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, drawing upon insights from psychology, sociology, and communication studies.  While social media platforms offer unprecedented opportunities for connection and information dissemination, their influence on individual and collective behavior warrants rigorous investigation.  We explore the psychological mechanisms underlying addictive behaviors, focusing on reward pathways and the impact of social comparison on self-esteem and mental well-being.  Sociological perspectives illuminate the role of social media in shaping identity formation, social movements, and the spread of misinformation.  Furthermore, communication studies provide a crucial lens for understanding the impact of algorithmic curation on information consumption and the formation of echo chambers, contributing to polarization and filter bubbles.  This interdisciplinary approach highlights the complex and often paradoxical effects of social media, emphasizing the need for nuanced research to navigate the ethical and societal implications of this pervasive technology.  The presentation will conclude by suggesting avenues for future research and potential strategies for mitigating negative consequences while harnessing the beneficial aspects of social media.
