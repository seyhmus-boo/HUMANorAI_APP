This presentation examines the persistent issue of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on society, drawing upon historical context and contemporary sociological perspectives.  Historically, class stratification, evident from ancient civilizations to feudal systems, has manifested in diverse forms, shaping social structures and power dynamics.  While industrialization and the rise of capitalism exacerbated inequality through the concentration of wealth and resources, the 20th century witnessed the emergence of welfare states aiming to mitigate its harshest impacts.  However, recent decades have shown a resurgence of widening gaps, particularly in many developed nations.

This presentation will explore the key mechanisms driving contemporary class inequality, including globalization, technological advancements, and regressive policy changes.  We will analyze its consequences across several societal domains: impacting health outcomes, educational attainment, political participation, and social mobility.  Furthermore, the presentation will touch upon the social consequences of entrenched inequality, such as increased crime rates, social unrest, and political polarization.  Finally, we will briefly consider potential policy interventions and strategies aimed at reducing inequality and promoting a more just and equitable society, acknowledging the complexities and challenges inherent in such endeavors.
