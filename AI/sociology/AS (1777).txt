This presentation explores the evolving role of education in shaping societal norms, focusing on recent developments in pedagogical theory and practice.  While traditional education has long aimed to transmit cultural values and acceptable behaviors, contemporary scholarship highlights a more nuanced and dynamic relationship.  Recent research emphasizes the critical role of education in fostering critical thinking, empowering individuals to question existing norms and participate in their transformation.  This includes the growing recognition of the influence of hidden curricula and the importance of inclusive pedagogical approaches that address systemic inequalities embedded within social norms.  The presentation will analyze recent advancements in educational methodologies such as participatory learning, social-emotional learning, and culturally responsive teaching, demonstrating their effectiveness in promoting positive social change.  Furthermore, the impact of digital technologies on the dissemination and reinforcement of norms through online learning platforms and social media will be examined.  Finally, the abstract will briefly address the ongoing challenges of ensuring educational systems effectively challenge harmful norms while promoting tolerance and understanding across diverse communities.
