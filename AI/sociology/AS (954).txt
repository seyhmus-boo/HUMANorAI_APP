This lecture explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth is insufficient for achieving societal flourishing.  While robust economic growth can undeniably contribute to improved living standards through increased employment and wealth generation, the distribution of these benefits is crucial.  Policies prioritizing neoliberal principles, such as deregulation and austerity, often exacerbate social inequalities, leading to diminished well-being for marginalized populations. Conversely, policies emphasizing social safety nets, equitable access to education and healthcare, and environmental sustainability demonstrate a stronger positive correlation with improved social indicators, including reduced poverty, enhanced health outcomes, and greater social cohesion.  Therefore, a holistic approach is necessary, integrating economic strategies with robust social policies that prioritize inclusive growth and the equitable distribution of resources.  Future research should focus on developing and rigorously evaluating policy interventions designed to optimize this crucial interplay.
