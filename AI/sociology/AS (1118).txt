Urbanization presents a complex challenge to community life, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to understanding its multifaceted impacts. This presentation explores the intricate relationship between rapid urban growth and the erosion or transformation of traditional community structures. We examine how sociological shifts, such as increased social stratification and anonymity, interact with the physical built environment, influencing social cohesion and well-being.  The presentation will draw upon research from sociology, urban planning, and public health, illustrating the synergistic effects of factors like spatial design, access to green spaces, and transportation infrastructure on social interaction and civic engagement.  Case studies will highlight contrasting urban development models and their respective impacts on community resilience and social capital.  Specifically, we will analyze how interdisciplinary collaborations – involving urban planners, sociologists, public health professionals, and economists – can be leveraged to develop more sustainable and community-focused urban development strategies. This work emphasizes the necessity of integrating social considerations into urban planning to foster vibrant and inclusive communities within increasingly dense urban landscapes.  Finally, we will outline potential avenues for future research to further illuminate the dynamic interplay between urbanization and the evolution of community life.
