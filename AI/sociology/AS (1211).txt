The conventional understanding of the relationship between economic policies and social well-being operates within a classical, deterministic framework.  However, a quantum mechanical analogy offers a more nuanced perspective.  Consider social well-being as a complex system described by a superposition of states, representing varying levels of health, education, and social cohesion.  Economic policies act as operators, influencing the probability amplitude of transitioning between these states.  A fiscally conservative policy, for example, may collapse the wavefunction towards a state characterized by low social mobility but high economic stability, while a progressive policy may increase the likelihood of achieving a state with greater equity, albeit with potentially higher economic uncertainty.  Furthermore, the observer effect is relevant; the very act of implementing and measuring the effects of a policy influences the system's evolution, introducing uncertainty and potentially unforeseen consequences.  Therefore, understanding the probabilistic nature of outcomes, as informed by quantum mechanics' concept of superposition and wave function collapse, is crucial for crafting effective economic policies that genuinely improve social well-being.  This necessitates probabilistic modelling and a recognition of irreducible uncertainty inherent in socio-economic systems.
