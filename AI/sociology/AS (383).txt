Globalization's impact on local cultures remains a complex and contested area of study. This presentation examines recent developments in this ongoing dialogue, moving beyond simplistic narratives of homogenization or cultural hybridity.  Recent research highlights a nuanced picture, revealing the diverse and often contradictory ways in which globalization affects cultural practices and identities.  We analyze the rise of "glocalization," where global trends are adapted and reinterpreted within specific local contexts, creating unique hybrid forms.  Furthermore, the presentation explores the role of digital technologies in both facilitating cultural exchange and contributing to the fragmentation of cultural landscapes.  The rise of online communities and social media, while fostering connectivity, also allows for the preservation and even resurgence of localized traditions, challenging assumptions of inevitable cultural dilution.  Finally, we consider the implications of these developments for cultural policy and the challenges of balancing the preservation of cultural heritage with the opportunities presented by global interconnectedness. The presentation concludes by suggesting avenues for future research focusing on the agency of local communities in shaping their cultural futures within a globalized world.
