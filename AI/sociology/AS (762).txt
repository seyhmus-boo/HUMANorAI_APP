This presentation explores the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, drawing upon insights from sociology, psychology, and communication studies.  While offering unprecedented opportunities for connection and information dissemination, social media platforms also exert profound influences on individual and collective actions, raising significant interdisciplinary concerns.  We will examine the psychological mechanisms underlying addictive behaviors associated with social media use, including the role of reward systems and social comparison processes.  Sociologically, we will analyze the impact on social capital, the formation of echo chambers and filter bubbles, and the spread of misinformation.  From a communication perspective, we will discuss the effects on language use, identity construction, and the evolving nature of interpersonal relationships.  By integrating these perspectives, the presentation aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between social media technologies and human behavior, highlighting both the positive and negative consequences, and suggesting avenues for future research exploring ethical and societal implications.  Ultimately, an interdisciplinary lens is crucial to effectively navigate the challenges and harness the potential of this increasingly pervasive technology.
