This presentation examines the pervasive and multifaceted impact of class inequality on societal well-being.  Focusing on contemporary Western societies, it argues that class stratification, beyond its immediate effects on individual life chances, exerts profound consequences on broader social structures and outcomes.  The analysis will draw upon established sociological theories, including Weberian stratification and Bourdieu's concepts of capital, to illuminate the mechanisms through which class inequality operates.  Specific areas of investigation will encompass the relationship between class and health disparities, educational attainment, political participation, and social mobility.  Empirical evidence will be presented to demonstrate the significant correlations between class background and outcomes in these domains, highlighting the persistent challenges to achieving equitable social outcomes. The presentation will conclude by discussing the implications of entrenched class inequalities for social cohesion and exploring potential policy interventions aimed at mitigating their negative consequences, emphasizing the need for multi-pronged strategies addressing both structural and individual-level factors.
