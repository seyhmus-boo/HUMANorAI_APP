The pervasiveness of social media has profoundly altered human interaction and behavior, prompting extensive research from sociological and psychological perspectives.  However, a novel and largely unexplored avenue lies in applying the principles of quantum mechanics to understand the inherently probabilistic and interconnected nature of human behavior within these digital environments. This paper proposes that a quantum-like framework, focusing on superposition, entanglement, and measurement, can offer valuable insights into the seemingly paradoxical aspects of social media influence.  We posit that individuals exist in a superposition of behavioral states before engaging with social media, collapsing into a specific state (e.g., expressing a particular opinion, making a purchase) upon interaction.  Furthermore, the entanglement of individual users within social networks, facilitated by algorithmic recommendation systems and shared online spaces, leads to correlated behaviors and the amplification of trends, mimicking quantum entanglement's non-local correlations.  The act of observing or measuring these behaviors, such as through user analytics, further influences the system's evolution.  This research will explore this quantum-inspired model, examining how superposition, entanglement, and measurement affect information propagation, behavioral conformity, and the emergence of collective phenomena on social media platforms.  The ultimate goal is to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the complex interplay between individual agency and collective behavior in the digital age.
