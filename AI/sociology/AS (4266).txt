Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies throughout history, manifests as disparities in wealth, power, and social status.  Historical precedents, from ancient Roman society’s stark divisions between patricians and plebeians to the feudal systems of medieval Europe, demonstrate the enduring nature of this stratification.  While the forms of inequality have evolved, the underlying mechanisms—access to resources, opportunities, and political influence—remain central.  Contemporary manifestations are often less overtly hierarchical, yet stark disparities in income and wealth persist, frequently exacerbated by factors like inherited privilege, discriminatory practices, and globalization’s uneven impact.  The consequences of class inequality are multifaceted and far-reaching.  High levels of inequality are correlated with reduced social mobility, hindering individual aspirations and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  Moreover, significant disparities contribute to social instability, manifesting in increased crime rates, strained social cohesion, and political polarization.  Ultimately, class inequality undermines the ideal of a just and equitable society, hindering overall societal well-being and progress.
