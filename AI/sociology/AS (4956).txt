This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a simplistic view of direct correlation is insufficient.  We posit that the connection is more akin to a complex ecosystem than a simple linear equation. Economic policies, analogous to the climate of an ecosystem, create conditions influencing the flourishing or decline of social well-being, represented by the diverse species within.  For instance, expansionary fiscal policy, like a warm and sunny climate, can stimulate economic growth, but if not carefully managed, may lead to inflation, akin to a devastating heatwave, harming vulnerable populations.  Similarly, restrictive monetary policy, like a harsh winter, can curb inflation but may simultaneously increase unemployment, negatively impacting social stability.

The analogy extends to the interdependence within the ecosystem:  health and education policies function like essential nutrients, promoting societal resilience and adaptability.  Inequality, on the other hand, represents invasive species, destabilizing the overall system and diminishing overall well-being.  Therefore, effectively promoting social well-being requires a holistic approach,  considering the interconnectedness of different economic levers and their cascading effects across various societal strata.  This presentation argues for a nuanced understanding of this interconnectedness, moving beyond simple cause-and-effect narratives towards a more ecological and systemic perspective.
