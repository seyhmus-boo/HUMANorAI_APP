Urbanization profoundly reshapes community life, necessitating an interdisciplinary approach to understand its multifaceted impacts. This abstract examines the complex interplay of social, environmental, and economic factors arising from population density increases in urban areas.  Sociological research reveals shifts in social capital, with potential declines in informal social interactions and increases in social isolation despite higher population densities.  Environmental science highlights the detrimental effects of urbanization on air and water quality, green spaces, and biodiversity, impacting community health and well-being.  Economic analyses demonstrate the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities, exacerbating existing inequalities and fostering spatial segregation.  Critically, the built environment, analyzed through architecture and urban planning perspectives, shapes social interactions and access to resources, directly influencing community cohesion and resilience. Interdisciplinary collaboration is crucial for developing effective strategies to mitigate the negative consequences of urbanization, promoting sustainable urban development that fosters vibrant, equitable, and healthy communities. Future research should prioritize integrated models incorporating these diverse perspectives to provide comprehensive solutions addressing this complex issue.
