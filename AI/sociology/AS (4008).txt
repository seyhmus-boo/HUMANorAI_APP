Social movements, defined as collective actions aimed at challenging existing power structures and achieving social change, are multifaceted phenomena demanding an interdisciplinary approach for thorough understanding.  Sociology provides frameworks for analyzing mobilization, collective identity, and resource mobilization.  Political science illuminates the relationship between movements and the state, focusing on strategies of contention, negotiation, and institutional change.  Anthropology contributes insights into cultural framing and the construction of shared meanings within the movement.  History, crucially, contextualizes the movement's trajectory, revealing its evolution within broader historical trends.  Furthermore, economics can analyze the distribution of resources and their impact on movement success, while psychology explores individual motivations and the dynamics of group behavior within the movement's framework. This interdisciplinary synergy is critical because social movements are not merely political actors but complex social entities shaping cultural norms, economic systems, and political landscapes.  Analyzing them requires a holistic understanding drawing from multiple disciplinary lenses.
