The pervasiveness of social media in contemporary society necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its impact on human behavior.  This research explores the multifaceted consequences of social media engagement, transcending disciplinary boundaries to integrate insights from psychology, sociology, communication studies, and computer science. While previous research has often focused on isolated aspects, such as the correlation between social media use and mental health or the spread of misinformation, this study adopts an interdisciplinary approach to offer a more holistic perspective.  We examine the interplay between social media algorithms, user behavior, and the resulting social, cognitive, and emotional effects.  Specifically, we investigate how algorithmic curation shapes information consumption and contributes to filter bubbles and echo chambers.  Furthermore, we analyze the influence of social media on self-perception, identity formation, and interpersonal relationships, considering both positive and negative ramifications. By drawing upon diverse theoretical frameworks and methodologies, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the complex and dynamic relationship between social media and human behavior, offering implications for policy, design, and individual well-being.
