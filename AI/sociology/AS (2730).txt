Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture focuses on class inequality and its societal ramifications.  Think of society as a body:  extreme class inequality is akin to a severe vitamin deficiency.  Just as a deficiency weakens the entire body, hindering its overall function, so too does inequality cripple societal progress.  

A society with vast disparities resembles a sports team where a few star players dominate, while the rest are under-resourced and lack training. This imbalance leads to decreased overall team performance; similarly, high inequality limits the potential of a nation.  Untapped human capital within lower classes translates to a diminished collective intelligence and productivity.  Furthermore, high levels of inequality exacerbate social unrest, acting like a chronic inflammatory condition, increasing the risk of social "illnesses" such as crime, political instability, and diminished social cohesion.  In essence, reducing class inequality is not simply a matter of fairness; it's an imperative for a healthy and flourishing society.
