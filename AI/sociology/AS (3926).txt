Education's role in shaping social norms remains a complex and debated topic, despite its intuitive appeal. While widespread societal changes often follow shifts in educational curricula and pedagogical approaches, isolating the causal impact of education on norm internalization through observational studies is challenging due to confounding factors like pre-existing beliefs and socioeconomic influences. Experimental approaches offer greater control, but present significant methodological hurdles. This abstract discusses the inherent difficulties in designing robust experiments to test education's influence on norms.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) face practical limitations, including ethical concerns regarding norm manipulation and the difficulty in achieving sufficient sample sizes and long-term follow-up to observe durable norm change. Further challenges involve the operationalization of "social norms" themselves, as they are multifaceted and context-dependent, requiring carefully constructed measures that accurately capture both individual attitudes and collective behaviors.  Moreover, the impact of education may differ depending on the specific norm targeted, the pedagogical approach utilized, and individual learning styles.  Future research requires innovative experimental designs, encompassing qualitative data to complement quantitative findings, to overcome these limitations and establish a more nuanced understanding of education's causal influence on social norms.
