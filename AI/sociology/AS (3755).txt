While seemingly disparate, the principles of quantum mechanics offer a useful metaphorical framework for understanding the pervasive effects of class inequality on society.  Just as quantum entanglement links seemingly disparate particles, class inequality creates interconnected societal states characterized by profound interdependence.  The "wave function" of societal well-being, encompassing factors such as health, education, and opportunity, is significantly distorted by the unequal distribution of resources.  Similar to how a superposition of quantum states collapses upon measurement, societal inequities manifest as observable disparities in life outcomes – a collapse of potential for marginalized groups.  The privileged class occupies a state of higher potential energy, possessing greater access to resources that function as "quantum catalysts," accelerating their upward mobility.  Conversely, the underprivileged exist in a lower energy state, experiencing a “quantum barrier” hindering their advancement, a consequence of systemic disadvantages like limited access to quality education and healthcare.  This energy disparity, analogous to the energy difference between quantum levels, creates an imbalance and inhibits the system's overall functionality, leading to societal instability, diminished productivity, and increased social unrest – manifestations of a destabilized societal "wave function."  The resolution of this inequality, akin to inducing a quantum transition, requires deliberate intervention to address the underlying systemic forces perpetuating this energy imbalance.
