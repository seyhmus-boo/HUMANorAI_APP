Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, presents significant challenges for experimental investigation.  While observational studies readily demonstrate correlations between socioeconomic status and various outcomes (e.g., health, education, incarceration rates), establishing causal relationships through experimentation faces considerable hurdles.  Randomly assigning individuals to different socioeconomic strata is ethically untenable and practically impossible.  Quasi-experimental designs, relying on natural experiments such as policy changes or geographic variations in income distribution, offer a partial solution but are susceptible to confounding variables and selection bias.  Furthermore, the long-term, multigenerational effects of class inequality are difficult to capture within the timeframe of most experiments.  The complex interplay of factors influencing social mobility—including access to resources, cultural capital, and intergenerational transmission of advantages—renders isolating the specific effects of class inequality a formidable task.  Consequently, researchers often rely on sophisticated statistical techniques to control for confounding factors, yet the limitations of these methods necessitate cautious interpretation of findings and a nuanced understanding of the inherent complexities of studying class inequality experimentally.
