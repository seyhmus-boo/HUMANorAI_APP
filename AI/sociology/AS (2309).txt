Education has historically served as a powerful instrument in shaping social norms, though its role has evolved across time and cultures.  Early forms of education, often religious or vocational, primarily reinforced existing societal structures and norms.  However, the rise of mass education in the 19th and 20th centuries introduced a new dynamic, with educational systems increasingly tasked with both transmitting and potentially transforming societal norms. This abstract examines the multifaceted influence of education on norm development and change.  Curriculum content, pedagogical approaches, and the social interactions within educational settings all contribute to the internalization of values, beliefs, and behaviors.  Studies demonstrate that education can promote prosocial norms, such as cooperation and civic engagement, through explicit instruction and implicit socialization. Conversely, educational systems can also inadvertently perpetuate or even exacerbate existing inequalities and harmful norms. Future research should focus on understanding the complex interplay between educational policies, classroom practices, and the resulting impact on the adoption and modification of social norms, acknowledging the mediating role of socioeconomic factors and cultural context.  A nuanced understanding of this dynamic is crucial for designing effective educational interventions aimed at fostering positive social change.
