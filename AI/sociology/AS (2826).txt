The relationship between economic policies and social well-being remains a central theme in contemporary economics, with recent research highlighting a complex and nuanced interplay beyond simple correlations.  While traditional macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth have been widely used, a growing body of literature emphasizes the limitations of such measures in capturing multifaceted social well-being.  Recent developments incorporate broader indicators, including subjective well-being measures, health outcomes, inequality metrics (e.g., Gini coefficient, Palma ratio), and environmental sustainability, to provide a more holistic assessment.  Studies examining the impact of specific policies, such as universal basic income (UBI) pilots and targeted social safety nets, reveal mixed but generally positive effects on various dimensions of well-being, depending on design and implementation.  Furthermore, research increasingly explores the role of institutional factors, including governance quality and social capital, in mediating the relationship between economic policies and social outcomes.  Future research should focus on strengthening causal inference methodologies and incorporating interdisciplinary perspectives to better understand the intricate pathways through which economic policies influence diverse aspects of social well-being, facilitating the design of more effective and equitable policies.
