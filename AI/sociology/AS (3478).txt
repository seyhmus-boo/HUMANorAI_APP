While a direct application of quantum mechanics to the macroscopic phenomenon of class inequality is non-existent, a metaphorical framework can be employed to highlight the system's inherent complexities.  Consider class as a multi-particle system, with individual agents (particles) possessing varying degrees of socioeconomic energy (potential and kinetic).  Class inequality, then, represents an uneven distribution of this energy, resulting in a highly non-equilibrium state.  The "wave function" of this system, representing the overall societal state, collapses probabilistically into various social outcomes based on the initial energy distribution.

High inequality acts as a potential energy barrier, restricting mobility between class "energy levels" and thus hindering the system's overall entropy. This limited mobility, analogous to quantum tunneling with low probability, creates a stratified society with limited social fluidity.  The resulting societal "wave function" exhibits high localized probability densities within specific class strata, mirroring persistent social divisions.  Furthermore, the interactions between particles – individuals and groups – are subject to complex probabilistic influences, with wealth accumulation behaving somewhat like quantum entanglement – the fortunes of the "wealth particle" influencing the probabilities of adjacent "particles." This entanglement exacerbates inequality, hindering the system's tendency towards equilibrium, a more equitable distribution of socioeconomic energy. Consequently, understanding class inequality requires recognizing this inherent probabilistic and complex entanglement, exceeding simplistic linear models.
