This review examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change.  While the efficacy of social movements is debated, a compelling body of literature demonstrates their significant impact across diverse historical contexts.  This review synthesizes key theoretical frameworks, including resource mobilization theory, political process model, and framing theory, highlighting their respective strengths and limitations in explaining movement emergence, success, and impact.  Empirical evidence suggests that successful movements effectively frame their grievances, mobilize resources, and strategically interact with existing power structures.  However, the review also acknowledges limitations, including the challenges faced by marginalized groups in accessing resources and navigating repressive state responses.  Furthermore, the long-term consequences of movement success, including unintended outcomes and the potential for co-optation, warrant further investigation.  Future research should focus on comparative analyses across diverse movements, examining the interplay between movement tactics, institutional responses, and broader socio-political contexts to gain a more nuanced understanding of social movement agency and its contribution to societal transformation.
