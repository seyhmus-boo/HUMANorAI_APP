The pervasive influence of social media on human behavior has become a subject of intense scrutiny across numerous disciplines.  While traditional sociological and psychological approaches dominate this field, this research paper proposes a novel perspective: exploring the impact of social media through the lens of quantum mechanics. We argue that the inherent uncertainties and probabilistic nature of human decision-making, analogous to quantum superposition and entanglement, are significantly amplified and modulated by the complex, interconnected network of social media interactions.  This paper departs from classical deterministic models by suggesting that individual behavior within the social media ecosystem isn't simply a sum of external stimuli but rather arises from a complex interplay of internal, quantum-like probabilistic states influenced by the dynamic environment. We posit that the constant influx of information, the inherent feedback loops, and the stochastic nature of online engagement create a system where superposition of behavioural possibilities persists longer than in offline contexts, delaying "measurement" (i.e., a definitive behavioral choice) and potentially leading to unforeseen outcomes. Examining the parallels between quantum phenomena, such as wave-particle duality and quantum tunneling, and observed online behavioral patterns—such as the rapid spread of misinformation or the unpredictable shifts in public opinion—offers a potentially transformative framework for understanding the profound societal impact of social media.  This research will explore these parallels, outlining a conceptual model that integrates quantum mechanical principles to illuminate the intricate relationship between social media and human behavior.
