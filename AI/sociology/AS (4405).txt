Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and reinforcing social norms. This paper examines the mechanisms through which formal and informal educational settings contribute to the transmission and internalization of societal values and beliefs.  Firstly, curricula, explicitly or implicitly, convey dominant social norms through the selection of content, pedagogical approaches, and the presentation of historical narratives. Secondly, the social interactions within educational institutions – amongst peers and with authority figures – foster conformity and the adoption of prevailing norms.  Thirdly, education equips individuals with critical thinking skills, potentially enabling them to challenge and reform existing social norms. However, this capacity for critical engagement is contingent upon the extent to which educational systems themselves are inclusive and representative of diverse perspectives.  Ultimately, the influence of education on social norms is a complex interplay between transmission, internalization, and critical analysis, shaped by both the content and context of the educational experience.  Future research should investigate the effectiveness of diverse pedagogical approaches in promoting both social cohesion and constructive social change.
