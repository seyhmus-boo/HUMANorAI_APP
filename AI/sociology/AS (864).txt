Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and perpetuating social norms, acting as both a transmitter and transformer of societal values.  This paper explores the theoretical mechanisms through which educational institutions influence norm internalization and change.  Firstly, formal curricula, implicitly and explicitly, convey societal expectations regarding behavior, morality, and social roles.  Secondly, the hidden curriculum, encompassing the informal rules and interactions within the educational setting, reinforces dominant norms through social learning and peer influence.  Thirdly, education facilitates critical thinking and reflexivity, enabling individuals to question and challenge existing norms.  This capacity for critical engagement can lead to norm innovation and social change, though it is also susceptible to reinforcement of existing power structures.  Finally, educational access and attainment are themselves socially stratified, leading to differential exposure to norm-shaping influences and perpetuating existing social inequalities.  Therefore, understanding education's complex interplay with social norms necessitates examination of both the transmission and transformation processes inherent within its diverse structures and practices.
