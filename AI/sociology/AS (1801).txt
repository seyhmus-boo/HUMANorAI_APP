The sociology of mental health examines the social factors influencing mental illness prevalence, diagnosis, treatment, and recovery. Historically, societal attitudes shaped understandings of mental illness, moving from explanations rooted in supernatural forces to the development of the medical model in the 19th and 20th centuries. This shift, while offering advancements in treatment, also pathologized certain behaviours and experiences, leading to stigmatization and social exclusion.

Contemporary sociological research explores the social determinants of mental health, such as socioeconomic status, social support networks, and exposure to discrimination.  Inequalities in access to quality healthcare, coupled with societal stigma, create significant barriers to treatment and recovery, particularly for marginalized groups.  Furthermore, the sociological perspective analyzes the impact of social structures, like family dynamics and institutional settings, on mental wellbeing.  This includes exploring the influence of societal norms and expectations on the development and expression of mental distress.  Ultimately, understanding the social dimensions of mental health is crucial for developing effective and equitable interventions that address both individual needs and systemic inequalities.
