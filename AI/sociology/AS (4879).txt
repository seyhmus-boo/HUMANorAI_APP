This presentation explores the multifaceted role of education in shaping and transforming social norms, drawing upon insights from sociology, psychology, and educational studies. We argue that education acts not merely as a transmitter of knowledge, but as a powerful agent of socialization, influencing individual beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors that collectively constitute social norms.  The interdisciplinary approach allows us to examine how curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment interact to cultivate specific norms â€“  be they related to gender equality, environmental responsibility, or civic engagement.  We will analyze how formal education interacts with informal learning processes within the school and broader community to reinforce or challenge existing norms.  Furthermore, we will consider the limitations of education in effecting social change, acknowledging the influence of factors beyond the school gates, such as family structures and media representations.  Finally, the presentation proposes a framework for utilizing education more effectively to promote positive social norms, emphasizing the importance of collaborative, interdisciplinary research and practice to achieve meaningful and lasting societal transformation.
