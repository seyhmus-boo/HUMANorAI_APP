Class inequality, a persistent societal feature throughout history, refers to the uneven distribution of resources, power, and opportunities based on social class.  Historically, feudal systems starkly exemplified this, with rigid hierarchies determining access to land and influence.  The Industrial Revolution exacerbated inequality, creating a burgeoning capitalist class alongside a vast, exploited working class.  While modern societies have witnessed the rise of the welfare state and progressive taxation, significant inequalities persist.

The effects of class inequality are multifaceted and detrimental.  High levels of inequality correlate with reduced social mobility, hindering individual potential and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  This undermines social cohesion, fostering resentment and potentially leading to social unrest and political instability.  Furthermore, unequal access to healthcare, education, and justice disproportionately impacts lower classes, resulting in poorer health outcomes, lower educational attainment, and increased incarceration rates. Ultimately, class inequality not only diminishes individual well-being but also impedes overall societal progress and development.
