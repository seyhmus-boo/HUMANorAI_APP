This presentation examines the pervasive and enduring impact of class inequality on societal structures and outcomes.  Historically, class stratification, manifesting in various forms from feudal systems to modern capitalism, has been a defining feature of human civilization.  While the specific mechanisms and manifestations of inequality have evolved, the fundamental tension between resource access and social mobility remains a significant driver of social instability and unrest.  We will trace the historical trajectory of class inequality, highlighting key shifts from agrarian economies to industrialization and the subsequent rise of globalized capitalism.  The analysis will then focus on the contemporary effects of this inequality, including its contribution to disparities in health outcomes, educational attainment, and criminal justice involvement.  Furthermore, the presentation will explore the social psychological impacts of class inequality, such as the perpetuation of prejudice and discrimination and the erosion of social cohesion.  Finally, we will briefly discuss potential pathways toward mitigating the negative societal consequences of class inequality, focusing on the need for comprehensive policy interventions targeting both its causes and its effects.
