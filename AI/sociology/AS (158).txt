This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, highlighting the crucial need for interdisciplinary approaches to fully understand and address this complex interplay. While traditional economics often prioritizes GDP growth as a primary indicator of success, this perspective overlooks crucial social dimensions integral to a flourishing society.  We argue that a holistic understanding necessitates integrating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science.  Specifically, we examine how macroeconomic policies like taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulations impact social indicators such as health outcomes, inequality, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability.  Using a mixed-methods approach, drawing on both quantitative economic data and qualitative social research, we analyze the distributional effects of specific policies, demonstrating how seemingly beneficial economic growth can exacerbate social inequalities if not carefully designed and implemented.  The presentation will conclude by advocating for interdisciplinary collaboration in policy design, emphasizing the necessity of moving beyond purely economic metrics towards a more nuanced and inclusive assessment of societal well-being.
