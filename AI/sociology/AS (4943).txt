The influence of education on societal norms is a complex and multifaceted issue with historical roots extending back to antiquity.  Early educational systems, while often elitist and focused on preserving existing power structures, nonetheless played a role in transmitting cultural values and shaping acceptable behaviors.  Classical education in Greece and Rome, for instance, instilled specific virtues and ideals considered crucial to maintaining social order.  However, the modern understanding of education's role in norm creation significantly transcends mere transmission.  This paper argues that education, encompassing formal schooling and informal learning processes, acts as a powerful agent of both socialisation and change, actively shaping, reinforcing, challenging, and even transforming prevailing social norms.  We will examine this influence across multiple dimensions, considering how curricula, pedagogical approaches, and institutional structures contribute to the internalisation of norms regarding gender, race, ethnicity, and other social categories.  Furthermore, we will investigate the contrasting impacts of education in different socio-cultural contexts, exploring instances where it has served to consolidate existing inequalities and others where it has fostered social progress and the adoption of more equitable norms.  This study ultimately aims to elucidate the dynamic interplay between education and social norms, contributing to a richer understanding of the processes through which societies evolve and transform.
