This presentation explores the impact of social media on human behavior through the lens of quantum mechanics, moving beyond classical deterministic models.  We posit that the inherent uncertainty and superposition inherent in quantum systems offer a valuable framework for understanding the probabilistic nature of human decision-making within the complex social media landscape.  Instead of viewing users as passively reacting to stimuli, we propose a model where individual choices – such as engagement, sharing, and opinion formation – exist in a superposition of states until observed (i.e., acted upon).  Social media algorithms, acting as "measurement devices," collapse these superpositions, influencing the probability of specific behavioral outcomes.  Furthermore, entanglement, a key concept in quantum physics, can be used to model the interconnectedness of users within social networks, where the actions of one individual can instantly influence the probabilistic states of others.  This presentation will discuss how quantum-inspired computational models can be developed to better predict and understand the complex interplay between individual behavior and the collective dynamics observed within online social environments, ultimately contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the pervasive effects of social media.  We will conclude by discussing potential future research directions, focusing on the implications for mitigating the negative and amplifying the positive impacts of social media.
