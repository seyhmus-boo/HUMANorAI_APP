Globalization's impact on local cultures can be viewed through a quantum mechanical lens, considering culture as a complex, entangled system.  Individual cultural practices (quanta) exist in superposition, exhibiting various states of expression simultaneously.  Globalization acts as a perturbation, introducing external influences that collapse these superpositions, favoring certain cultural expressions while suppressing others. This "measurement" process is non-deterministic; the outcome depends on the strength and nature of the globalizing force and the inherent resilience of the local system.  Stronger global pressures (e.g., mass media) lead to rapid decoherence, resulting in cultural homogenization.  Conversely, robust local cultural "entanglements" – strong social bonds and traditions –  act as a shielding mechanism, reducing the impact of external perturbation and preserving cultural distinctiveness.  The degree of cultural hybridization observed is a function of the interference pattern arising from the interaction between globalizing forces and pre-existing cultural states, resulting in a complex, emergent cultural landscape that is not simply a sum of its constituent parts.  Further research exploring the concept of cultural entanglement and its sensitivity to globalizing "measurements" may yield valuable insights into cultural preservation and transformation.
