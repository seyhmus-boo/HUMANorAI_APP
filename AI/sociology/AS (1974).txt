This presentation explores the multifaceted role of education in shaping and reshaping social norms, drawing upon insights from sociology, psychology, and anthropology.  While formal curricula transmit explicit knowledge and values, the hidden curriculum – encompassing implicit biases, power dynamics, and social interactions within educational settings – significantly influences the internalization of societal norms. We argue that educational institutions act as microcosms of broader society, reflecting and reinforcing existing norms, but also possessing the potential to challenge and transform them.  

An interdisciplinary lens reveals how pedagogical approaches, teacher-student interactions, and the social structure of schools impact the development of attitudes and behaviors related to gender, ethnicity, class, and other social categories. This includes examining the impact of diverse learning environments and inclusive curricula on fostering tolerance and challenging prejudice.  Furthermore, we will explore how educational interventions, such as peer education programs and critical consciousness-raising initiatives, can effectively promote positive social change by modifying entrenched norms and empowering individuals to challenge inequalities.  The presentation concludes by emphasizing the crucial responsibility of educational systems in cultivating socially responsible citizens equipped to navigate and reshape societal norms.
