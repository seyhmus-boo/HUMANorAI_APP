This review examines the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, synthesizing existing research across sociological, psychological, and anthropological perspectives.  While increased cultural diversity offers potential benefits such as enhanced creativity and economic dynamism, it also presents challenges to social cohesion.  Studies consistently demonstrate a correlation between higher levels of diversity and increased social segregation, manifesting in residential patterns, social networks, and even political polarization. However, the impact of diversity is not uniform; mediating factors such as institutional support, inclusive policies, and intergroup contact significantly influence integration outcomes.  Effective integration strategies, the review suggests, necessitate proactive efforts beyond mere tolerance. These include promoting intercultural dialogue, addressing systemic inequalities, and fostering environments that celebrate diversity while simultaneously building shared values and a sense of collective belonging.  Further research should focus on longitudinal studies examining the long-term effects of diversity management policies and the development of robust, empirically validated metrics for assessing social integration in diverse societies.  The ultimate goal is to leverage the strengths of cultural diversity while mitigating its potential downsides to create truly inclusive and equitable societies.
