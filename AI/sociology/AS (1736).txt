Social movements are crucial agents of societal change, yet their causal impact remains a subject of ongoing debate and methodological challenges.  This abstract highlights the inherent difficulties in experimentally evaluating the effects of social movements.  Randomized controlled trials, the gold standard in causal inference, are often impractical due to the organic and emergent nature of these movements, hindering the isolation of treatment effects.  Furthermore, the complex interplay of factors influencing societal change – encompassing pre-existing grievances, political opportunity structures, and framing effects – confounds attempts at establishing clear cause-and-effect relationships.  Quasi-experimental designs, while offering a viable alternative, are vulnerable to selection bias and omitted variable problems.  Existing research predominantly relies on observational studies, susceptible to endogeneity and reverse causality.  This necessitates the development of innovative methodological approaches, such as process tracing, agent-based modeling, and natural experiments exploiting exogenous shocks, to better understand the mechanisms through which social movements drive societal transformations.  Further research should prioritize the triangulation of multiple methods to overcome these limitations and produce more robust conclusions about the efficacy of social movements in fostering societal change.
