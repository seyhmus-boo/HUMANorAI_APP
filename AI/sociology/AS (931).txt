This paper examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simplistic correlation to explore nuanced causal mechanisms and mediating factors.  While economic growth is often touted as a prerequisite for improved social well-being, the paper argues that the type of growth, its distribution, and accompanying policy choices significantly influence outcomes.  Specifically, it analyzes the impact of fiscal policies (e.g., taxation, social welfare programs) on poverty reduction, health indicators, and educational attainment, highlighting the crucial role of equity in achieving broad-based social progress.  Furthermore, the analysis considers the influence of monetary policy on employment levels and income inequality, revealing potential trade-offs between price stability and social justice.  The paper incorporates a critical perspective on neoliberal policies, arguing that their focus on market liberalization often exacerbates existing inequalities and undermines social safety nets.  Ultimately, it underscores the necessity of adopting a holistic policy framework that prioritizes both economic efficiency and social equity to foster sustainable and inclusive social well-being.  Further research should focus on developing robust econometric models to disentangle the complex interplay between specific policy instruments and their diverse societal impacts.
