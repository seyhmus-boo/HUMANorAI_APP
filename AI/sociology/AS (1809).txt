The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, posing significant challenges for experimental evaluation.  While economic models often posit a direct link between economic growth and improved social outcomes, empirically establishing this connection proves difficult.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), a gold standard in causal inference, are often hampered by practical limitations.  For instance, the large scale and long-term nature of many policy interventions make RCTs prohibitively expensive and time-consuming. Ethical concerns may also arise, particularly when policies involve resource allocation impacting vulnerable populations.  Furthermore, the heterogeneity of social well-being, encompassing factors like health, education, and subjective happiness, presents measurement challenges.  Capturing these multidimensional aspects within a single experimental design requires robust and often context-specific methodologies.  Finally, spillover effects and unforeseen consequences, inherent in complex socio-economic systems, can confound results, making it challenging to isolate the causal impact of a specific policy intervention on social well-being.  Consequently, researchers often rely on quasi-experimental designs and econometric techniques to infer causal relationships, but these approaches are subject to greater interpretative uncertainty.
