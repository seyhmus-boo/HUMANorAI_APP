The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a cornerstone of public policy debate, yet establishing clear causal links remains a significant challenge. While macroeconomic indicators offer valuable insights into aggregate trends, they often fail to capture the nuanced and heterogeneous impacts of policy interventions on individuals and communities.  This paper examines the inherent difficulties in empirically evaluating this relationship, focusing on the methodological limitations of traditional econometric approaches and the burgeoning field of experimental economics.  We argue that despite the potential of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to address endogeneity concerns and isolate causal effects, their applicability to large-scale economic policy is often constrained by practical, ethical, and logistical factors.  Furthermore, the external validity of findings from localized experiments may be limited in their generalizability to diverse contexts and populations.  This paper will explore these experimental challenges, including issues of sample selection bias, treatment fidelity, and the difficulty in replicating complex policy interventions in controlled settings. Ultimately, we aim to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the methodological hurdles in assessing the impact of economic policies on social well-being, suggesting avenues for future research and methodological advancements.
