The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is multifaceted and necessitates an interdisciplinary approach.  Purely economic metrics, such as GDP growth, inadequately capture the complexities of societal flourishing.  Effective analysis requires integrating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science. For example, neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and privatization, while potentially boosting GDP, may exacerbate income inequality, documented by sociologists to negatively impact health outcomes (as shown by the Whitehall studies) and social cohesion.  Conversely, social policies like universal basic income, studied by economists and behavioral scientists, aim to address poverty and improve mental health, ultimately contributing to a more productive and stable society.  Political scientists highlight the crucial role of policy implementation and governance structures in determining the equitable distribution of economic benefits. Therefore, a holistic understanding demands a synthesis of economic principles with insights from social sciences to craft policies that genuinely enhance societal well-being, moving beyond solely economic indicators.
