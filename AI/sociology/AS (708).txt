The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, with recent developments highlighting the limitations of solely focusing on traditional macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth. While economic growth remains crucial for providing resources to fund social programs and improve living standards, its impact on social well-being is increasingly understood to be mediated by factors such as income inequality, access to healthcare and education, and environmental sustainability.  Recent research emphasizes the importance of inclusive growth, advocating for policies that promote equitable distribution of wealth and opportunities, rather than simply maximizing aggregate output.  The COVID-19 pandemic starkly revealed the fragility of social well-being in the face of economic shocks, highlighting the need for robust social safety nets and resilient healthcare systems. Furthermore, growing awareness of climate change necessitates integrating environmental considerations into economic policymaking, recognizing the long-term social costs of environmental degradation.  Consequently, contemporary policy debates are shifting towards a broader understanding of economic prosperity, encompassing not only material wealth but also social justice, health, and environmental sustainability, signifying a move beyond purely GDP-centric approaches to economic management.
