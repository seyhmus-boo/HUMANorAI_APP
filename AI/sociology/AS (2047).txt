Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding and effective mitigation.  This abstract highlights the interconnectedness of sociological, economic, and psychological perspectives on class inequality's societal effects. Sociologically, stratification impacts access to resources (education, healthcare, justice), perpetuating disadvantage across generations.  Economic analyses reveal the widening wealth gap, fueled by factors like globalization and technological advancements, resulting in reduced social mobility and increased economic insecurity.  Psychologically, chronic stress stemming from socioeconomic disadvantage is associated with impaired cognitive function, mental health issues, and reduced life expectancy, further exacerbating societal disparities.  Interdisciplinary research demonstrates feedback loops:  limited educational attainment fosters economic vulnerability, influencing psychological well-being, which in turn negatively impacts social participation and political engagement.  Addressing class inequality necessitates integrated policies encompassing educational reforms, progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and initiatives targeting mental health disparities.  Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies exploring the complex interplay between these factors, providing a more nuanced understanding to inform effective interventions.
