Class inequality, a persistent societal feature, significantly impacts various aspects of social life, impacting health, education, and political participation.  This abstract synthesizes extant research examining the multifaceted consequences of class stratification.  Studies consistently demonstrate a strong correlation between socioeconomic status (SES) and health outcomes, with lower SES individuals experiencing higher rates of morbidity and mortality due to factors including limited access to quality healthcare and increased exposure to environmental hazards.  Educational attainment is also profoundly shaped by class, with individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds facing systemic barriers to accessing higher education and experiencing diminished educational mobility.  This disparity in educational opportunity contributes to the perpetuation of intergenerational inequality. Furthermore, class inequality undermines democratic participation by limiting political engagement and influence among lower SES groups, contributing to unequal representation and policy outcomes.  Addressing class inequality requires comprehensive policy interventions targeting healthcare access, educational reform, and promoting economic mobility, ultimately fostering a more equitable and just society.  Further research should focus on the intersectionality of class with other social categories to better understand the complex dynamics of societal stratification.
