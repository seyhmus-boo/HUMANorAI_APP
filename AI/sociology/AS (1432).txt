Social movements, collective actions aimed at achieving social or political change, have long been a central focus of sociological and political science inquiry.  This paper examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal transformation, focusing on recent developments that challenge established theoretical frameworks.  While classic theories emphasized resource mobilization and framing processes, contemporary scholarship increasingly highlights the significance of digital technologies, transnational networks, and the complexities of hybrid activism.  The rise of social media platforms, for example, has profoundly altered mobilization strategies, enabling rapid dissemination of information, the formation of decentralized networks, and the circumvention of traditional gatekeepers.  Simultaneously, globalization has fostered transnational solidarity, with movements leveraging international connections to amplify their impact.  However, this increased connectivity also presents challenges, including issues of digital surveillance, the spread of misinformation, and the potential for fragmentation within movements.  This study will analyze these emergent trends, exploring how they reshape the dynamics of social movements and their ultimate effectiveness in prompting significant societal change, using case studies to illustrate the diverse manifestations of contemporary activism and their varying degrees of success.
