This presentation examines the persistent issue of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on society, drawing upon historical context and contemporary evidence.  Historically, class stratification, manifesting in feudal systems and later industrial capitalism, has shaped social structures and power dynamics.  While the specifics of class formation have evolved, the fundamental disparity in access to resources – including wealth, education, and healthcare – remains a defining feature of modern societies.  

The consequences of this inequality are profound and far-reaching.  Empirical research consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and various social problems, including reduced life expectancy, increased crime rates, and diminished social mobility.  Furthermore, entrenched class divisions can fuel social unrest, political instability, and hinder economic growth by limiting opportunities for a significant portion of the population.  This presentation will explore various theoretical perspectives on class inequality, analyze its manifestations in different societal contexts, and discuss potential policy interventions aimed at mitigating its negative consequences, considering both structural and individual-level approaches to promote greater equity and social justice.
