Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the persistent challenge of empirically investigating class inequality and its societal ramifications.  While the existence of class inequality is widely acknowledged,  quantifying its precise effects and disentangling causal mechanisms proves remarkably difficult.  One key experimental challenge lies in the inherent difficulty of randomly assigning individuals to different class strata, ethically and practically impossible.  Observational studies, therefore, frequently suffer from confounding variables, making it hard to isolate the independent impact of class on outcomes like health, education, or criminal justice involvement.  Furthermore, the multidimensional nature of class – encompassing income, wealth, occupation, and social capital – complicates analysis.  Measuring these components reliably and integrating them into comprehensive models remains a significant methodological hurdle.  Finally, the long-term and cumulative effects of class inequality necessitate longitudinal studies, which are expensive, logistically complex, and prone to attrition bias, further hindering robust causal inference.  Overcoming these experimental challenges is crucial for developing effective policies aimed at reducing inequality and its pervasive societal consequences.
