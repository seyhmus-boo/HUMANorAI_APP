Education plays a crucial role in shaping social norms, impacting individual attitudes and behaviors across various societal levels.  This paper explores the interdisciplinary links between education, sociology, psychology, and anthropology to elucidate this complex relationship.  Sociological perspectives highlight how educational institutions transmit cultural values and beliefs, thereby reinforcing or challenging existing social norms.  Psychological research emphasizes the cognitive and affective processes through which education influences norm internalization, including moral reasoning and empathy development.  Anthropological studies illuminate the contextual variations in the effectiveness of educational interventions, demonstrating the importance of culturally sensitive approaches.  Specifically, we analyze the influence of educational curricula, teaching methodologies, and peer interactions on the adoption and internalization of prosocial norms related to gender equality, environmental sustainability, and health behaviors.  Empirical evidence suggests a positive correlation between higher levels of education and the adoption of progressive social norms, though this relationship is moderated by factors such as socioeconomic status and societal power dynamics.  Further interdisciplinary research is crucial to understand fully the dynamic interplay between education and societal norms, paving the way for more effective educational strategies promoting positive social change.
