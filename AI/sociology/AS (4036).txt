Good morning.  While seemingly disparate, quantum mechanics offers a useful framework for understanding class inequality's societal impact.  Consider societal stratification not as a classical, deterministic system, but as a superposition of potential states – each individual existing in a probabilistic range of socioeconomic outcomes.  Class inequality then represents a significant bias in the wave function, collapsing the probability of upward mobility for lower-class individuals, akin to a measurement forcing a quantum system into a specific eigenstate.

This unequal distribution of resources, opportunities, and even inherent social capital—represented by entanglement with higher-class networks—creates a societal entanglement analogous to a many-body problem. The limited potential of lower-class individuals restricts the overall societal potential, reducing the total "wave function" of progress.  This suppression manifests in various societal ills: increased crime rates, poorer health outcomes, and diminished social cohesion, acting as decoherence mechanisms impacting the overall system's efficiency.  Thus, while individual mobility may be probabilistic, systemic inequality establishes a deterministic bias, hindering overall societal advancement and preventing the exploration of a wider range of potential futures.
