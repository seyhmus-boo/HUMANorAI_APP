Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have historically played a pivotal role in shaping societal structures and values.  This paper examines the multifaceted relationship between social movements and societal change, focusing on recent developments that necessitate a reassessment of established theoretical frameworks.  While classical theories emphasized mobilization around clear-cut grievances and the influence of resource mobilization, contemporary movements exhibit increasingly fluid organizational structures and utilize novel strategies facilitated by digital technologies.  The rise of transnational activism, exemplified by global climate movements and anti-globalization protests, challenges traditional geographic boundaries of influence and necessitates a more nuanced understanding of power dynamics.  Furthermore, the growing importance of online mobilization, including the use of social media for organizing, disseminating information, and framing narratives, demands an investigation into the impact of digital platforms on movement efficacy and sustainability.  This paper will explore these evolving characteristics, analyzing the successes and limitations of contemporary movements in achieving societal transformation, and proposing a framework for understanding their increasingly complex interplay with existing power structures in the digital age.
