The study of social movements and their role in societal change significantly benefits from an interdisciplinary approach.  While sociology provides foundational theories on collective action and resource mobilization,  political science illuminates the interplay between movements and the state, analyzing strategies of negotiation, protest, and institutional change.  History offers crucial context, revealing the long-term impacts and legacies of past movements and highlighting the contingent nature of success. Anthropology's focus on culture and identity helps decipher the underlying values and beliefs shaping movement mobilization and framing.  Furthermore, economics contributes insights into the distribution of resources and power, clarifying the material conditions driving participation and shaping outcomes.  Critically,  communication studies examines the role of media and rhetoric in constructing narratives and mobilizing support.  This interdisciplinary lens reveals the complexity of social movements, moving beyond simplistic cause-and-effect narratives.  It allows for a nuanced understanding of how movements interact with existing power structures, negotiate identities, and ultimately shape the trajectory of social, political, and economic life.  Future research should continue fostering these interdisciplinary collaborations to more fully comprehend the multifaceted processes of social change.
