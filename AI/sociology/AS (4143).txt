This presentation explores the evolving impact of social media on human behavior, focusing on recent developments in research.  While previous studies highlighted the correlation between social media use and mental health issues like anxiety and depression, recent work is delving deeper into the mechanisms underlying these effects. We will examine the role of algorithmic amplification of negative content, the impact of social comparison on self-esteem, and the influence of online echo chambers on political polarization.  Furthermore, the presentation will address emerging research on the impact of short-form video platforms like TikTok on attention spans and information processing, and the increasingly complex relationship between social media use and identity formation, particularly amongst adolescents.  Recent longitudinal studies demonstrating the long-term consequences of heavy social media engagement will be highlighted. Finally, we will briefly discuss the limitations of current research methodologies and propose future directions for a more nuanced understanding of this pervasive societal influence.  The overall aim is to provide an updated overview of the field and encourage critical discussion regarding both the benefits and detrimental effects of social media on individual and collective well-being.
