This presentation explores the multifaceted role of education in shaping and transforming social norms, drawing on insights from sociology, psychology, and anthropology.  We argue that education acts not merely as a transmitter of knowledge, but as a powerful agent of socialization, influencing attitudes, beliefs, and behaviours.  Through curriculum design, pedagogical approaches, and the broader school environment, educational institutions actively cultivate specific norms, values, and identities.  

We will analyze how interdisciplinary perspectives illuminate this complex relationship. Sociological frameworks, such as social reproduction theory, will be utilized to examine how education can both reinforce existing inequalities and challenge dominant norms.  Psychological theories of learning and social cognition will explore how educational experiences shape individual attitudes and beliefs, influencing subsequent behaviour.  Anthropological approaches will highlight the culturally specific nature of norm-formation within educational contexts, emphasizing the variability of educational impacts across diverse settings.

Finally, we will discuss the implications of these findings for educational policy and practice.  Specifically, we propose that a more nuanced understanding of education's socializing function is crucial for designing effective interventions to promote positive social change and address persistent societal challenges linked to harmful social norms.  The presentation will conclude by outlining avenues for future interdisciplinary research in this vital area.
