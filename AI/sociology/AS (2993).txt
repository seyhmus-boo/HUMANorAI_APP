Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, transcends disciplinary boundaries, impacting various aspects of human life and social structures.  From a sociological perspective, it manifests in stratified access to resources, power, and opportunities, leading to disparities in health, education, and social mobility.  Economic analyses reveal the cyclical nature of inequality, where concentrated wealth perpetuates itself through inheritance and advantageous access to capital, exacerbating existing divides.  Furthermore, political science illuminates how unequal distribution of resources translates into uneven political influence, solidifying the dominance of privileged classes and marginalizing the voices of the less powerful.  Psychologically, class inequality contributes to stress, diminished well-being, and social alienation, potentially leading to increased rates of mental health issues among disadvantaged groups.  Finally, historical perspectives demonstrate the enduring nature of class systems and their role in shaping societal structures, highlighting how past inequalities continue to influence present-day disparities.  Addressing class inequality, therefore, requires an interdisciplinary approach that considers its complex economic, social, political, and psychological dimensions to achieve equitable and just social outcomes.
