Social movements, defined as organized collective efforts to promote or resist societal change, play a crucial role in reshaping social structures, norms, and values.  Their efficacy stems from the mobilization of resources—human capital, financial support, and symbolic power—to challenge existing power dynamics.  Recent developments reveal a shift towards digitally-mediated mobilization, leveraging social media platforms for rapid dissemination of information, recruitment of participants, and the coordination of actions, as seen in the Arab Spring uprisings or the Black Lives Matter movement.  This digitalization, however, also presents challenges, including the spread of misinformation, state surveillance, and the potential for algorithmic bias to influence participation and impact.  Furthermore, while traditionally focused on broad social change, contemporary movements frequently exhibit a hybridized approach, incorporating both offline and online strategies to target specific policy changes or promote localized social justice initiatives.  The increasing interconnectedness of global networks has fostered transnational solidarity, enabling the coordination of actions across geographical boundaries and facilitating the exchange of strategies and tactics among diverse movements striving for similar goals.  Ultimately, the ongoing evolution of social movements demonstrates their enduring capacity to affect profound and lasting societal transformations, albeit within a constantly evolving technological and political landscape.
