This paper investigates the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, exploring the extent to which macroeconomic strategies influence societal outcomes beyond traditional economic indicators.  While economic growth is often posited as a primary driver of improved social well-being, the relationship is not necessarily linear or direct.  This study analyzes the impact of various economic policies – including fiscal policy, monetary policy, and trade liberalization – on a range of social well-being indicators, encompassing health outcomes, educational attainment, income inequality, and social cohesion.  We employ a comparative case study approach, examining the experiences of selected developed and developing nations to account for diverse contextual factors and institutional arrangements.  The research aims to identify causal pathways linking specific economic policies to social welfare outcomes, thereby contributing to a more nuanced understanding of the trade-offs and synergies inherent in economic policy design.  Ultimately, this study seeks to inform policy recommendations that promote both economic prosperity and enhanced social well-being, moving beyond a narrow focus on GDP growth to encompass a more holistic measure of societal progress.
