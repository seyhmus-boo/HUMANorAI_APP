The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, posing significant challenges for empirical investigation. While ostensibly aiming to improve societal welfare, economic policies often have unintended consequences, making causal inference difficult.  Experimental approaches, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), offer a powerful tool to isolate policy effects, but face considerable limitations.  Ethical concerns surrounding the potential for harm to control groups restrict the applicability of RCTs to certain policy areas.  Furthermore, the external validity of RCT findings often suffers, as tightly controlled experimental settings may not accurately reflect the complexities of real-world implementation.  Another challenge is the difficulty in measuring social well-being comprehensively.  Existing metrics, such as GDP per capita or subjective well-being scores, offer only partial insights into the multifaceted nature of well-being, encompassing factors like health, education, and social inclusion.  Consequently, establishing a robust causal link between specific economic policies and improved social well-being requires innovative experimental designs capable of addressing both ethical concerns and the inherent complexity of societal outcomes.
