Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon demanding an interdisciplinary approach.  This abstract examines the interplay of economic, sociological, and anthropological perspectives to understand this effect.  Economic globalization, through trade liberalization and foreign direct investment, fosters cultural homogenization via the spread of global brands and consumerism, potentially leading to the marginalization of traditional crafts and practices.  Sociological studies reveal the emergence of hybrid cultural forms, demonstrating the agency of local communities in adapting and reinterpreting global influences.  Anthropological research highlights the resilience of local cultures, often manifested in the strategic appropriation of global symbols for local purposes, creating nuanced expressions of identity.  However, the uneven distribution of globalization's benefits contributes to cultural inequalities, with some communities experiencing significant cultural loss while others navigate a complex process of negotiation and adaptation.  Further interdisciplinary research is crucial to fully comprehend the diverse and dynamic relationship between globalization and local cultural survival, resilience, and transformation.  This includes exploring the role of digital technologies and the increasing importance of transnational cultural flows in shaping contemporary cultural landscapes.
