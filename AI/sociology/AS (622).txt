This presentation examines the ongoing evolution of gender roles in modern societies, highlighting the intricate interplay between sociological, anthropological, and psychological perspectives.  Traditional gender binaries are increasingly challenged by diverse lived experiences and social movements advocating for gender equality and fluidity.  We will explore how sociological analyses of power structures and social institutions, such as the family and the workplace, intersect with anthropological studies of cultural variations in gender norms and expressions.  Furthermore, psychological research on gender identity development and the impact of socialization processes will be integrated to provide a comprehensive understanding of this complex phenomenon.  The presentation will discuss the influence of globalization, technological advancements, and shifting economic structures on the renegotiation of gender roles, demonstrating how these forces interact to shape individual identities and societal expectations.  Finally, we will consider the limitations of existing theoretical frameworks and suggest avenues for future interdisciplinary research that better captures the fluidity and complexity of gender in the 21st century.
