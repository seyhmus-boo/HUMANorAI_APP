Education's role in shaping social norms is a complex interplay between formal curriculum and informal socialization within educational settings.  While often posited as a powerful vehicle for societal change, empirical evidence reveals significant challenges.  Experimental studies examining the effectiveness of educational interventions aimed at altering specific norms, such as gender roles or attitudes towards intergroup relations, frequently demonstrate mixed results.  

Challenges arise from the inherent resistance to norm change, the influence of pre-existing beliefs and social contexts outside the educational environment, and the difficulty in measuring long-term impacts.  Many interventions struggle to overcome the deeply ingrained nature of social norms, with observed changes often proving superficial or short-lived.  Furthermore, the "spillover effect," where positive changes within the educational setting fail to translate to broader societal shifts, poses a considerable obstacle.  Control groups, often crucial in experimental designs, are difficult to establish, making causal inferences challenging.  Ultimately, while education can certainly influence norms,  its efficacy depends on a multifaceted approach considering contextual factors and addressing the limitations exposed by rigorous experimental methodologies.
