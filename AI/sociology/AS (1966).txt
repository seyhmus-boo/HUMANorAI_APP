This review examines the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, synthesizing existing literature to highlight key interdependencies.  While economic growth is often posited as a primary driver of improved social outcomes, the relationship is demonstrably nuanced and contingent upon the specific policy choices implemented.  Studies consistently reveal that policies prioritizing equitable distribution of wealth, robust social safety nets, and investment in human capital (education and healthcare) correlate strongly with enhanced social well-being indicators, including reduced poverty, improved health outcomes, and increased life satisfaction.  Conversely, policies focused solely on macroeconomic growth, neglecting distributional effects and social safety nets, frequently exacerbate inequality and social fragmentation, undermining overall well-being despite potential increases in GDP.  The review further explores the limitations of relying solely on GDP as a measure of societal progress and advocates for the adoption of multi-dimensional well-being indices that capture a broader range of social, environmental, and economic factors.  Future research should prioritize investigating the long-term impacts of specific policy interventions and their effectiveness across diverse socio-economic contexts.
