Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, exerts profound and multifaceted effects across various sectors.  This abstract explores the interdisciplinary implications of this pervasive phenomenon, drawing upon sociological, economic, and psychological perspectives. Sociologically, class inequality manifests in disparate access to resources, opportunities, and social capital, reinforcing existing power structures and perpetuating cycles of disadvantage. Economically, it contributes to decreased overall productivity, hampered innovation, and increased social costs associated with crime and healthcare.  Psychological research reveals the detrimental effects of inequality on individual well-being, manifesting as increased stress, anxiety, and diminished life satisfaction, particularly for those in lower socioeconomic strata.  Furthermore, political science highlights the link between inequality and political instability, with marginalized groups experiencing reduced political efficacy and participation.  A comprehensive understanding of class inequality requires an interdisciplinary approach, integrating insights from these fields to develop effective and targeted interventions.  Future research should focus on examining the synergistic effects of these factors and developing policy recommendations that address the complex interplay of social, economic, and psychological dimensions of class inequality to promote a more equitable and just society.
