Urbanization, the increasing concentration of human populations in urban areas, is a defining characteristic of the 21st century. While offering economic opportunities and improved access to services, this rapid shift profoundly impacts community life, often with complex and multifaceted consequences. This paper examines the multifaceted relationship between urbanization and community cohesion, exploring both the positive and negative effects on social interaction, civic engagement, and overall well-being.  We analyze the erosion of traditional community structures alongside the emergence of new forms of social capital within increasingly diverse urban environments.  Key factors influencing this dynamic, such as density, spatial design, and access to green spaces, will be considered.  Furthermore, the research will delve into the implications of these changes for policy and urban planning.  Understanding these impacts has significant practical applications, informing the development of sustainable urban strategies aimed at fostering strong, resilient, and inclusive communities.  This includes informing the design of mixed-use developments that promote social interaction, strategies to improve access to green spaces and community facilities, and the development of policies that support community-based initiatives and address social inequalities exacerbated by rapid urbanization.
