Class inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across societal strata, exerts profound and multifaceted effects on societal well-being.  This paper theorizes that high levels of inequality exacerbate social instability through several mechanisms.  Firstly, concentrated wealth and power within a dominant class can lead to the erosion of democratic processes, with policy decisions disproportionately benefiting the affluent.  Secondly, inequality fosters resentment and social fragmentation, potentially fueling inter-group conflict and hindering social cohesion.  Increased stress associated with socioeconomic disadvantage, including precarious employment and limited access to healthcare and education, contributes to poorer health outcomes and reduced life expectancy amongst lower classes.  Furthermore, high levels of inequality can negatively impact economic growth, as it restricts social mobility and limits the potential contribution of a significant portion of the population.  Addressing class inequality, therefore, requires multi-pronged approaches targeting both the distribution of wealth and access to resources and opportunities, thereby promoting a more equitable and stable society.
