Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, significantly impacts various social outcomes, yet establishing causal links through experimental research remains fraught with difficulties.  This abstract discusses the inherent methodological limitations in studying the effects of class inequality.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), while considered the gold standard, face near-impossibility in manipulating class structures ethically and practically on a large scale.  Quasi-experimental designs, employing natural experiments or regression discontinuity approaches, offer alternatives but are susceptible to confounding variables and endogeneity biases, particularly regarding the complex interplay of socioeconomic factors and individual agency.  Furthermore, accurately measuring class, encompassing both objective (e.g., income, wealth) and subjective (e.g., social status, perceived class) dimensions, presents significant challenges, potentially leading to measurement error and misinterpretations.  Longitudinal studies are crucial for understanding the cumulative effects of inequality across generations, demanding considerable resources and posing difficulties in tracking individuals over extended periods. Addressing these methodological hurdles necessitates innovative research designs, leveraging advancements in big data analytics and incorporating mixed-methods approaches to provide a more nuanced understanding of the multifaceted impact of class inequality on society.
