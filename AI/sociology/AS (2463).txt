Education's role in shaping social norms is a multifaceted process with significant implications for societal development. This review examines the literature exploring this relationship, highlighting education's capacity to both reinforce and challenge existing norms.  Formal schooling transmits societal values and beliefs through curricula, pedagogical approaches, and the hidden curriculum, thereby contributing to the reproduction of existing social structures.  However, education also possesses transformative potential. Critical pedagogy and inclusive curricula can challenge dominant norms, fostering critical thinking and promoting social justice.  Research reveals a correlation between higher levels of education and shifts towards more egalitarian attitudes, though the extent of this influence varies across contexts and depends on the specific educational content and delivery.  Further research is needed to fully understand the mediating factors influencing the effectiveness of educational interventions in shaping norms, including the interaction between formal education and informal socialization processes.  Ultimately, understanding this complex relationship is crucial for designing effective educational strategies aimed at fostering positive social change and promoting inclusive societies.
