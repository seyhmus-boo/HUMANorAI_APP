Class inequality, a persistent societal ill, transcends purely economic dimensions, impacting numerous facets of life.  Sociological perspectives highlight its role in shaping social stratification, access to resources, and power dynamics.  Inequality fosters a cycle of disadvantage, limiting educational attainment and occupational mobility for lower classes, thus perpetuating intergenerational poverty as evidenced by Bourdieu's concept of cultural capital.  Furthermore, psychological research demonstrates the detrimental effects of socioeconomic disparities on mental and physical health, manifesting as increased stress, anxiety, and diminished life expectancy amongst disadvantaged groups.  

From a political science standpoint, class inequality undermines democratic principles by creating unequal access to political participation and influence.  Economically, it hinders overall societal productivity and economic growth, as a significant portion of the population lacks the resources to fully participate in the economy.  A multidisciplinary approach is crucial to understanding and addressing this complex issue, requiring collaboration between economists, sociologists, psychologists, and political scientists to develop effective and holistic solutions.  Ignoring these interdisciplinary links risks producing fragmented and ultimately ineffective interventions.
