Social media's pervasive influence on human behavior necessitates an interdisciplinary approach to understanding its multifaceted impacts. This abstract highlights key findings across psychology, sociology, and communication studies.  Psychological research demonstrates social media's effects on self-esteem, body image, and mental well-being, often mediated by social comparison processes and cyberbullying.  Sociological studies reveal its role in shaping social networks, influencing political polarization, and impacting the spread of misinformation.  Communication studies emphasize the impact of algorithmic curation on information consumption, filter bubbles, and echo chambers, potentially reinforcing existing biases and hindering critical thinking.  Furthermore,  interdisciplinary research explores the intersection of these fields, revealing how social media's design features interact with individual predispositions and societal structures to influence behavior.  Future research should focus on longitudinal studies tracking long-term behavioral changes, nuanced analyses of specific platform effects, and the development of evidence-based interventions to mitigate negative consequences and harness the positive potential of social media.  A truly comprehensive understanding necessitates integrating insights from diverse disciplines to address this complex phenomenon.
