Social movements, defined as organized collective efforts to promote or resist societal change, are complex phenomena requiring interdisciplinary analysis to fully understand their genesis, trajectory, and impact.  Sociology provides frameworks for analyzing mobilization, framing, and resource mobilization, examining how movements recruit members, construct narratives, and secure necessary resources.  Political science contributes by exploring the interaction between movements and state institutions, investigating the strategies employed to influence policy and the responses of governing bodies.  Anthropology offers insights into the cultural contexts shaping movement ideologies and practices, illuminating the interplay between local traditions and broader global influences.  Furthermore, history offers crucial long-term perspectives, tracing the evolution of similar movements and identifying recurring patterns of success and failure.  Finally, psychology helps elucidate individual motivations for participation, examining the psychological processes underpinning collective action and the impact of movement involvement on individual identities and well-being.  By integrating these perspectives, a richer, more nuanced understanding of social movements and their crucial role in driving – or resisting – societal transformation emerges.
