Education plays a crucial role in shaping and perpetuating social norms, acting as both a transmitter and a potential transformer of cultural values. Historically, educational institutions have served as agents of socialization, instilling dominant societal norms and values through curricula and pedagogy.  From ancient Greece's emphasis on civic virtue to the Victorian era's focus on moral instruction, education has consistently reflected and reinforced prevailing social structures.  The hidden curriculum, encompassing unspoken rules and expectations, further contributes to norm internalization.  

However, education is not solely a conservative force.  Progressive educational movements have challenged existing norms, advocating for inclusivity and social justice.  Critical pedagogy, for instance, seeks to empower students to question dominant narratives and actively participate in shaping a more equitable society.  By exposing students to diverse perspectives and fostering critical thinking, education can facilitate the evolution of social norms.  Therefore, the relationship between education and social norms is dynamic, with education capable of both reinforcing existing structures and driving positive social change.
