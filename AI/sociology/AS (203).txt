Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on the evolution of gender roles in modern societies.  Think of traditional gender roles as a rigid, pre-programmed computer operating system:  men assigned the “provider” function, women the “caretaker.” This system, historically prevalent, dictated societal expectations with limited flexibility.  However, modern society is akin to a constantly updating operating system, receiving patches and upgrades.  

Feminist movements, economic shifts, and technological advancements have functioned as these upgrades. Increased female participation in the workforce, for example, is analogous to installing a powerful new processor – redefining capabilities and challenging the old limitations. Similarly,  the rise of stay-at-home fathers represents a significant alteration to the core code, demonstrating a shift in the acceptable distribution of tasks.  While the system isn't entirely rewritten, the evolution towards greater fluidity and individual expression is undeniable. However, vestiges of the old system remain – biases embedded deep within the code – making the ongoing process of reprogramming a complex and ongoing challenge.
