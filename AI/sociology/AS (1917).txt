This abstract explores the hitherto unconsidered application of quantum mechanical principles to understanding the relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  We propose a conceptual framework that views societal well-being not as a classical, deterministic outcome of economic policies, but as a superposition of potential states influenced by policy interventions.  Economic policies, analogous to quantum measurements, collapse this superposition, yielding a specific societal outcome. The inherent uncertainty principle suggests that precise prediction of social well-being following a specific policy is impossible; instead, probabilities of various outcomes can be calculated, reflecting the inherent unpredictability of complex social systems.  This framework further considers entanglement, whereby the well-being of different societal subgroups becomes interconnected, meaning policy impacting one group inevitably influences others.  The concept of quantum tunneling is invoked to describe the potential for unexpected societal shifts resulting from seemingly minor policy changes.  Finally, we propose that developing robust social welfare models requires acknowledging this inherent quantum uncertainty and focusing on optimizing the probability of desirable outcomes, rather than pursuing illusory deterministic control. Future research will focus on developing quantitative models incorporating these principles and testing their empirical validity.
