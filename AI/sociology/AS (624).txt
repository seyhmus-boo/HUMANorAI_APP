This presentation explores the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change, highlighting the crucial contribution of interdisciplinary approaches to understanding their dynamics and impact.  While traditionally studied through sociological lenses, a comprehensive analysis necessitates drawing on insights from political science, history, anthropology, and psychology.  The presentation argues that social movements are not simply reactive forces responding to societal inequalities, but also proactive agents shaping political landscapes and cultural norms.  We will examine the interplay between movement mobilization strategies, framing processes (drawing on framing theory from sociology and communication studies), and the broader socio-political context, emphasizing the impact of media representation (drawing on media studies) and the psychological processes of collective action.  Case studies will illustrate the effectiveness of diverse tactics – from nonviolent resistance to more contentious forms – and their varying degrees of success in achieving their objectives.  Finally, the presentation will address the limitations and challenges inherent in studying social movements, highlighting the need for rigorous interdisciplinary collaboration to foster a more nuanced and complete understanding of their complex relationship with societal transformation.
