This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, drawing upon insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and political science.  While cultural diversity is often touted as enriching society, its impact on social integration is complex and contested. We argue that simplistic narratives of either harmonious multiculturalism or inevitable conflict are insufficient.  Instead, we propose a framework that considers the interplay of various factors influencing integration outcomes. This includes examining the role of state policies promoting inclusion or exclusion, the influence of pre-existing social structures and inequalities, and the agency of diverse communities in shaping their own integration processes.  Specifically, we will analyze how differing approaches to language acquisition, access to education and employment, and the prevalence of social networks impact the level and nature of social integration.  By adopting an interdisciplinary perspective, we aim to move beyond simplistic generalizations and offer a nuanced understanding of the challenges and opportunities presented by cultural diversity for fostering inclusive and cohesive societies.  This framework will highlight the crucial need for tailored policy interventions informed by robust empirical evidence from diverse disciplinary perspectives.
