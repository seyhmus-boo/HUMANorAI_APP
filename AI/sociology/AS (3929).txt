Class inequality, a persistent societal stratification, significantly impacts various aspects of life, demonstrably linked across disciplines.  Sociologically, unequal distribution of resources and opportunities reinforces social hierarchies, leading to disparities in education, healthcare, and political participation.  Economically, this translates into reduced aggregate demand, hindering growth and fostering instability, as explored by Marxian and Keynesian economics.  Psychologically, chronic stress from socioeconomic disadvantage can negatively impact mental health and cognitive development, as evidenced by epidemiological studies.

Furthermore, criminology identifies a correlation between class inequality and crime rates, with marginalized groups disproportionately represented in both victimisation and perpetration.  Political science reveals how unequal power structures, born from class divisions, influence policy-making, often perpetuating the existing inequalities.  Public health research demonstrates a strong link between socioeconomic status and health outcomes, highlighting the detrimental impact of inequality on life expectancy and overall well-being.  Understanding class inequality necessitates an interdisciplinary approach to comprehensively analyze its multifaceted consequences and develop effective solutions.
