This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being, highlighting the crucial need for interdisciplinary collaboration in its analysis and management.  While traditional economics often focuses on aggregate measures like GDP, a comprehensive understanding necessitates integrating perspectives from sociology, psychology, and political science.  We argue that solely prioritizing economic growth, without considering its distributive effects and social impacts, can lead to inequitable outcomes and ultimately undermine overall well-being.  This presentation will examine specific policy examples – such as minimum wage legislation, social safety nets, and investment in public goods – analyzing their effects not only on economic indicators but also on factors like health, education, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability.  Drawing upon empirical evidence from diverse disciplinary sources, we demonstrate how interdisciplinary research can offer a more nuanced and effective approach to policy design.  Ultimately, we contend that a holistic understanding, integrating economic considerations with broader social and environmental factors, is crucial for developing policies that genuinely promote flourishing societies.  This necessitates a move beyond purely economic metrics towards a more inclusive framework that incorporates qualitative data and prioritizes the well-being of all citizens.
