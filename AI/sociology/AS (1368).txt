This presentation examines the pervasive issue of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on society.  We argue that class, defined not solely by income but also encompassing wealth, social capital, and cultural capital, significantly shapes life chances and societal outcomes.  The consequences of this inequality extend beyond individual hardship, impacting crucial societal functions.  We will explore how class disparities contribute to unequal access to education, healthcare, and justice, ultimately undermining social cohesion and fostering instability.  Furthermore, we will analyze the link between class inequality and political polarization, demonstrating how economic disparities can translate into unequal political representation and influence.  The presentation will draw upon existing sociological and economic literature, incorporating empirical evidence to illustrate these interconnected effects.  Finally, we will briefly discuss potential practical applications for mitigating class inequality, focusing on policy interventions aimed at enhancing social mobility, promoting equitable resource distribution, and fostering inclusive social institutions. These interventions will include examples of successful programs and initiatives from diverse national contexts, offering concrete avenues for addressing this pressing social problem.
