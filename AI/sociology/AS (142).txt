Education plays a crucial role in shaping and perpetuating social norms, acting as both a transmitter and a transformer of cultural values.  This paper argues that formal education systems, through curriculum design, pedagogy, and socialization processes within the school environment, actively contribute to the internalization of societal expectations.  The transmission of norms occurs through explicit instruction (e.g., civics lessons promoting civic duty) and implicit socialization (e.g., classroom hierarchies reinforcing power dynamics).  However, education is not merely a passive conveyor; it also possesses the potential to challenge and reform existing norms.  Critical pedagogy, for instance, can empower students to question dominant narratives and advocate for social change.  Furthermore, exposure to diverse perspectives and intercultural dialogue within educational settings can foster tolerance and dismantle discriminatory norms.  Ultimately, understanding the complex interplay between education and norm formation is critical to developing effective strategies for promoting positive social change and addressing societal inequalities.  Future research should explore the nuanced effects of different educational approaches on the internalization and transformation of social norms across various cultural contexts.
