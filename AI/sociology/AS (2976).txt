Social movements have served as potent catalysts for societal change throughout history, challenging established power structures and driving transformative shifts in social norms, political landscapes, and economic systems.  This presentation explores the multifaceted role of social movements in effecting societal transformation, examining their historical trajectory from early agrarian revolts to contemporary digital activism.  We will analyze key theoretical frameworks explaining movement emergence, mobilization, and success, including resource mobilization theory and framing theory.  Historical examples will illustrate the diverse tactics employed – from civil disobedience and protest to lobbying and litigation – and their varying degrees of effectiveness in achieving specific goals.  The presentation will further investigate the interplay between social movements and institutional actors, including state responses, media coverage, and the role of counter-movements.  Finally, we will consider the enduring legacies of successful movements and analyze the challenges faced by contemporary social movements navigating increasingly complex globalized contexts, including the impact of digital technologies and the rise of transnational activism.  The overall aim is to highlight the critical, albeit often contested, contribution of social movements to the ongoing evolution of society.
