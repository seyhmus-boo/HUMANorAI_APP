Class inequality, a persistent societal feature, exerts profound and multifaceted effects on various social outcomes.  This abstract examines existing literature demonstrating the pervasive influence of socioeconomic disparities on health, education, and social mobility.  Studies consistently reveal a strong negative correlation between socioeconomic status (SES) and a range of health indicators, including life expectancy, morbidity rates, and mental health outcomes.  The impact on education is equally significant, with lower SES individuals experiencing reduced access to quality education, resulting in lower educational attainment and diminished opportunities.  Furthermore, intergenerational social mobility is demonstrably constrained by class inequality, perpetuating cycles of poverty and limiting upward social movement.  These disparities contribute to social instability, manifesting as increased crime rates, political polarization, and reduced social cohesion.  Addressing class inequality requires multifaceted interventions targeting educational access, healthcare provision, and economic policies aimed at promoting equitable wealth distribution and reducing income disparities.  Future research should focus on understanding the complex interplay between various factors contributing to class inequality and evaluating the effectiveness of different policy interventions in mitigating its detrimental societal consequences.
