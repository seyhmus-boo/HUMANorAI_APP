Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the persistent challenge of empirically demonstrating the societal effects of class inequality.  While the existence of inequality is readily observable, establishing a causal link between its various dimensions (income, wealth, access to resources) and broader societal outcomes presents significant methodological hurdles.

One key difficulty lies in disentangling correlation from causation.  High rates of crime and poor health, for instance, often correlate with lower socioeconomic status, but this doesn't automatically imply inequality *causes* these issues.  Confounding factors – individual choices, genetic predispositions, neighborhood effects – complicate causal inference.  Experimental approaches, such as randomized controlled trials, are ideally suited to address this, but ethical considerations and practical limitations often render them infeasible for studying large-scale societal phenomena like class inequality.

Natural experiments, exploiting exogenous shocks like policy changes or unexpected events, offer a partial solution, though the identification of truly exogenous variation remains crucial.  Furthermore, the complexity of inequality, encompassing various interacting dimensions, necessitates sophisticated multivariate analyses to capture its multifaceted effects, adding further analytical complexity to already challenging empirical research.
