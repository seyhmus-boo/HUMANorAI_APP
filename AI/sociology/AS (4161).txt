Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, profoundly impacts various facets of human life, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding and effective intervention. This presentation explores the multifaceted effects of class inequality, drawing on insights from sociology, economics, political science, and psychology.  We will examine the economic consequences, such as widening wealth gaps and limited social mobility, highlighting the role of structural factors like unequal access to education, healthcare, and employment opportunities.  Further, the political implications will be analysed, including the erosion of democratic participation and the influence of money in politics.  Sociological perspectives will illuminate the ways in which class shapes social networks, cultural capital, and ultimately, individual life chances.  Finally, we will explore the psychological impacts of inequality, encompassing stress, mental health disparities, and the perpetuation of intergenerational trauma. By integrating these diverse disciplinary perspectives, this presentation aims to provide a nuanced understanding of class inequalityâ€™s far-reaching consequences and to stimulate discussion on effective strategies for promoting social justice and equitable outcomes.  The presentation will conclude by suggesting avenues for future interdisciplinary research.
