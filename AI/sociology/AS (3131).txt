Globalization's impact on local cultures is a subject of ongoing debate, marked by both homogenization and hybridization. This presentation examines the multifaceted effects of globalization on local cultural practices, exploring the tensions between global integration and cultural preservation. We analyze the influence of global media, transnational corporations, and international migration on the transmission and transformation of cultural norms, values, and traditions.  The study utilizes a comparative framework, drawing on case studies from diverse geographical regions to illustrate the varying responses of local cultures to globalization's pressures.  Specific examples will include the impact of globalized food systems on traditional diets, the influence of Western media on indigenous storytelling practices, and the adaptation of religious beliefs within a globalized context.  We argue that while globalization can lead to cultural homogenization through the spread of global brands and cultural products, it also facilitates hybridization, creating novel cultural forms through the blending of local and global elements.  The presentation concludes by considering the implications for cultural diversity and the need for strategies to support cultural preservation in a globalized world.
