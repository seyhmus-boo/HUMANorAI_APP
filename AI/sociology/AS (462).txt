This presentation explores the ongoing evolution of gender roles in modern societies, highlighting the interconnectedness of sociological, anthropological, and psychological perspectives. While traditional gender roles remain influential, significant shifts are observable across various cultural contexts.  We will examine the impact of globalization, technological advancements, and economic restructuring on the renegotiation of gendered expectations within the family, workplace, and public sphere. Drawing on both quantitative and qualitative research methodologies, we will analyze evolving power dynamics, shifting social norms, and the emergence of diverse gender identities.  Crucially, the presentation will address the interplay between macro-level societal structures and micro-level individual experiences, demonstrating how societal changes influence personal identity formation and vice-versa.  An interdisciplinary lens allows us to unpack complex factors such as the persistence of gender inequality despite legal reforms and the influence of cultural narratives on perceptions of masculinity and femininity.  Finally, we will consider future trajectories, acknowledging the complexities and ongoing debates surrounding gender equality and the ongoing fluidity of gender roles in the 21st century.
