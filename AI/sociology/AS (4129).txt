This presentation examines the persistent and evolving impact of class inequality on societal well-being.  Recent developments highlight a widening gap between the wealthiest and poorest segments of populations globally, despite economic growth in many regions.  We will explore how this inequality manifests in various societal spheres, including health disparities, educational attainment, and political participation.  Emerging research reveals a correlation between high levels of inequality and decreased social mobility, hindering intergenerational progress and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  Furthermore, we will address the implications of automation and technological advancements in exacerbating existing inequalities, particularly through job displacement and the concentration of wealth in the hands of technology owners.  Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss policy interventions proposed to mitigate class inequality, such as progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and investments in education and affordable housing.  A critical analysis of the effectiveness and limitations of these policies in light of recent socio-economic trends will be undertaken.
