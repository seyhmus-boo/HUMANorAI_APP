Education plays a multifaceted role in shaping and perpetuating, as well as challenging and transforming, social norms. This paper examines the complex interplay between educational institutions and societal values, arguing that the curriculum, pedagogy, and social environment within schools significantly influence the internalization of norms by students.  Formal education transmits dominant cultural values through explicit instruction and implicit socialization, reinforcing existing power structures and social hierarchies.  However, education also serves as a critical space for contesting and renegotiating norms.  Critical pedagogy, inclusive curricula, and diverse learning environments can foster critical consciousness, enabling students to question and challenge established societal expectations.  The paper further analyzes how education differentially impacts individuals based on social identities such as class, race, and gender, potentially exacerbating or mitigating existing social inequalities.  Ultimately, understanding the dynamic relationship between education and social norm construction is crucial for developing educational strategies that promote social justice and equitable societal transformation.  Future research should focus on empirically investigating the effectiveness of various pedagogical approaches in fostering both norm adherence and critical engagement.
