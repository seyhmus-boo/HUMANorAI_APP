Class inequality, a persistent societal feature, significantly impacts various aspects of social well-being and collective progress. This abstract examines the multifaceted consequences of this inequality, focusing on its deleterious effects on health, education, and economic mobility.  Research consistently demonstrates a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and health outcomes, with lower-class individuals experiencing higher rates of chronic disease and lower life expectancy.  Educational attainment is similarly affected, as limited access to quality education and resources exacerbates existing inequalities, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage across generations.  Furthermore, economic mobility is severely restricted for lower-class individuals, limiting opportunities for social advancement and fostering social stratification. These effects cumulatively undermine social cohesion, increase crime rates, and hinder economic growth.  Practical applications of this research include informing policy interventions aimed at reducing inequality through targeted investments in education, healthcare, and social safety nets.  Such interventions, guided by empirical evidence on the mechanisms linking class to societal outcomes, can promote more equitable societies characterized by improved health, increased educational attainment, enhanced economic mobility, and greater social stability.  Further research is necessary to evaluate the effectiveness of these interventions and to explore the complex interplay of factors contributing to class inequality's pervasive influence.
