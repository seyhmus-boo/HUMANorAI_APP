Education plays a crucial role in shaping and reinforcing social norms through both formal and informal curricula.  Formal education, via explicit instruction and mandated learning, transmits societal values, beliefs, and acceptable behaviors.  Textbooks, lesson plans, and assessments often reflect dominant cultural norms, implicitly shaping students' understandings of appropriate conduct and social expectations.  Recent developments highlight the increasing focus on incorporating diverse perspectives and challenging historically entrenched biases within curricula, reflecting a growing awareness of the role education plays in perpetuating inequalities.

Informal education, encompassing social interactions within educational settings, is equally influential. Peer groups and teacher-student relationships contribute significantly to the internalization of norms.  Recent research emphasizes the impact of inclusive classroom environments on promoting empathy and challenging prejudice, potentially leading to shifts in social norms surrounding issues like gender equality, tolerance of difference, and social justice.  However, the continued presence of biases within institutional structures and pedagogical practices underscores the complex and often contested nature of education's role in norm formation, demanding ongoing critical examination and reform.
