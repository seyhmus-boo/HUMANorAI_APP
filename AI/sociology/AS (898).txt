Social media's impact on human behavior is a relatively recent area of scholarly inquiry, stemming from its rapid proliferation in the late 2000s.  Prior to its widespread adoption, interpersonal communication relied heavily on face-to-face interaction and traditional media, shaping social norms and behaviors accordingly.  The emergence of platforms like Facebook and Twitter introduced novel forms of social interaction, characterized by asynchronous communication, networked public spheres, and the construction of curated online identities.  

This shift has demonstrably altered human behavior in several ways.  Studies suggest a correlation between social media usage and increased rates of anxiety and depression, potentially linked to social comparison, cyberbullying, and the pressure to maintain a positive online persona. Conversely, social media can facilitate social connection, community building, and the dissemination of information, potentially leading to increased political engagement and collective action. However, the spread of misinformation and echo chambers also presents a significant challenge, impacting informed decision-making and fostering polarization. The long-term behavioral consequences of this pervasive technology remain a subject of ongoing investigation and debate.
