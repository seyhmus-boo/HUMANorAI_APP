This presentation explores the complex and multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being, emphasizing the crucial need for interdisciplinary collaboration to effectively analyze and address this nexus.  While traditional economics often focuses on aggregate measures like GDP, a holistic understanding requires integrating insights from sociology, psychology, political science, and public health. We argue that narrowly defined economic growth, unaccompanied by equitable distribution and consideration of social determinants of health and happiness, can fail to enhance overall well-being.

This presentation will examine specific policy examples, demonstrating how seemingly beneficial economic strategies can inadvertently exacerbate social inequalities, impacting mental health, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability. We will analyze the limitations of purely economic indicators and advocate for the integration of alternative metrics, such as the Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI) or the Happy Planet Index (HPI), that capture a broader spectrum of well-being dimensions.  Finally, we will propose a framework for interdisciplinary research and policymaking, highlighting the importance of collaborative efforts to design and implement effective policies that promote both economic prosperity and genuine social well-being for all members of society.  This necessitates a shift from a purely economistic approach to a more holistic and socially just perspective.
