This presentation explores the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond simplistic correlations to examine nuanced causal relationships. We argue that a unidimensional focus on economic growth, neglecting distributional effects and social determinants of health, yields an incomplete picture of societal prosperity.  The analysis draws upon a multidisciplinary framework integrating economics, sociology, and public health, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies.  Specifically, we investigate the impact of specific policy interventions—including tax reforms, social safety nets, and investment in human capital—on key indicators of social well-being, such as health outcomes, income inequality, and social cohesion. We find evidence suggesting that policies prioritizing equitable distribution and social inclusion, rather than solely maximizing aggregate growth, demonstrably improve overall societal well-being.  Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of traditional economic metrics in capturing the full spectrum of social well-being and propose alternative measurement frameworks that incorporate subjective well-being and quality of life indicators.  Finally, we offer policy recommendations for creating more just and prosperous societies by aligning economic policies with the broader goals of social well-being.
