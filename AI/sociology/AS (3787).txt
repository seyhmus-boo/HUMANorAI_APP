The study of social movements and their impact on societal change significantly benefits from an interdisciplinary approach.  While sociology provides foundational frameworks for understanding mobilization and collective action,  political science contributes crucial insights into power dynamics, policy influence, and state responses.  History offers vital contextualization, illuminating the long-term consequences and evolution of movements across various eras.  Anthropology provides valuable perspectives on cultural interpretations, framing strategies, and the role of identity in shaping movement narratives.  Furthermore, economics helps analyze resource allocation within movements and the economic impacts of their successes or failures.  

A truly comprehensive understanding necessitates integrating these perspectives. For example, analyzing the Civil Rights Movement requires examining sociological theories of collective behavior alongside the political strategies employed, the historical context of Jim Crow laws, and the anthropological understanding of racial identity.  Ignoring any one of these facets would result in an incomplete and potentially misleading analysis.  The interdisciplinary lens reveals the complex interplay of factors contributing to movement emergence, success, and lasting societal transformations, ultimately enriching our capacity to comprehend the dynamic relationship between social movements and societal change.
