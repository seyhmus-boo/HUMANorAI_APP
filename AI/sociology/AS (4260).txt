Social movements, collective actions aimed at achieving significant societal change, have been a persistent feature of human history, shaping political landscapes and cultural norms across diverse societies.  From ancient revolts against oppressive regimes to contemporary movements advocating for climate justice or LGBTQ+ rights, these organized efforts represent a crucial mechanism for challenging existing power structures and promoting alternative visions of society.  Historically, the study of social movements has often focused on specific instances of collective mobilization, analyzing their organizational structures, mobilization strategies, and impacts.  However, recent scholarship has emphasized the interconnectedness of movements across time and space, highlighting the cumulative effects of sustained activism on broader societal transformations. This paper explores the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change, examining both their capacity to effect incremental reforms and their potential to instigate more radical, transformative shifts. We will analyze the interplay between movement strategies, state responses, and broader socio-political contexts, drawing on both classical and contemporary theoretical frameworks to offer a nuanced understanding of the complex dynamics shaping the relationship between social movements and societal change.
