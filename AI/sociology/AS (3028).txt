This presentation examines the persistent and evolving nature of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on contemporary societies.  While traditional markers of class remain relevant, recent scholarship highlights the increasing complexity of stratification, moving beyond simple economic indicators to encompass factors such as social capital, cultural capital, and access to technology.  We will explore how these interwoven dimensions contribute to a widening gap between the affluent and the disadvantaged, impacting key societal outcomes.

Recent developments, including the exacerbation of inequality by automation and globalization, will be discussed, along with the rise of precarious work and the increasing cost of living in many developed nations.  The presentation will analyze the resulting social consequences, such as declining social mobility, increased health disparities, and the erosion of democratic participation.  Furthermore, it will touch upon the burgeoning literature investigating the psychological impacts of inequality, including heightened stress and diminished well-being across different socioeconomic strata.  Finally, we will briefly consider potential policy interventions aimed at mitigating the negative effects of class inequality and fostering a more equitable society, acknowledging the complexities and limitations of such interventions in the face of entrenched power structures.
