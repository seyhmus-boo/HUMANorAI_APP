Good morning. Today's lecture concerns class inequality and its societal ramifications.  Imagine a marathon where some runners begin at the starting line, while others are miles behind, burdened with heavy packs.  This illustrates the uneven playing field created by class inequality â€“ inherited advantages or disadvantages profoundly impact life chances.  Those starting behind face steeper obstacles, hindering their progress regardless of inherent ability.

This disparity isn't merely a matter of individual success or failure.  It's akin to a building with a structurally unsound foundation.  High levels of inequality erode social cohesion, fostering resentment and distrust, much like cracks appearing in a building's walls.  This weakens the social fabric, leading to increased crime rates, poorer public health outcomes, and ultimately, a less stable and prosperous society for all.  Like a garden neglected due to unequal resource allocation,  some parts flourish while others wither, resulting in an uneven and ultimately less productive landscape.  Addressing class inequality, therefore, is not simply a matter of fairness but a crucial investment in societal health and long-term sustainability.
