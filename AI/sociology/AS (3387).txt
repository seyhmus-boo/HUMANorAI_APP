Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, evolving significantly since its intensification post-World War II.  Historically, cultural exchange has always occurred, but globalization's accelerated pace, driven by technological advancements and neoliberal economic policies, has amplified its effects.  Early forms of globalization, such as colonialism, often resulted in the suppression of indigenous cultures through forced assimilation.  However, contemporary globalization presents a more nuanced picture.  

While homogenizing forces like global media and consumerism threaten cultural diversity, leading to cultural erosion and the adoption of dominant Western norms, simultaneously, globalization facilitates cultural hybridity and revitalization.  Local cultures adapt and reinterpret global trends, creating unique syncretic forms.  For instance, the fusion of traditional music with global pop styles exemplifies this cultural hybridization.  Furthermore, globalization provides platforms for marginalized communities to assert their identities and challenge dominant narratives through transnational networks and digital spaces.  Therefore, the effect is not simply one of uniform assimilation but a dynamic interplay between homogenization, hybridization, and resistance, varying greatly depending on specific cultural contexts and power dynamics.
