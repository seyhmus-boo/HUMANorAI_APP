Social movements, defined as collective actions aimed at achieving social or political change, play a crucial role in reshaping societal structures and norms.  This lecture explores their multifaceted influence, emphasizing the dynamic interplay between movement mobilization, framing strategies, and the broader socio-political context. Successful movements effectively articulate grievances, mobilizing resources and framing issues in ways that resonate with broader public sentiment. This process, however, is not linear;  resistance from established power structures, internal divisions, and the limitations of available resources significantly impact a movementâ€™s trajectory and success.  Further, the lecture examines the diverse outcomes of social movements, ranging from incremental policy adjustments to transformative societal shifts, highlighting the enduring legacy of even seemingly unsuccessful movements in raising awareness and challenging dominant ideologies.  Ultimately, understanding social movements requires analyzing the complex interplay between agency, structure, and the contingent nature of historical events.
