Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have played a pivotal role in shaping societies throughout history.  From the abolitionist movement dismantling slavery to the suffrage movement securing women's voting rights, their impact on societal change is undeniable.  Historically, these movements have often emerged in response to systemic inequalities and injustices, mobilizing individuals to challenge dominant power structures and advocate for alternative social arrangements.  The success of a social movement hinges on several factors, including the mobilization of resources – both material and human –  the development of cohesive organizational structures, and the framing of their grievances in a compelling and persuasive manner that resonates with broader segments of the population.  Furthermore, the strategic deployment of various tactics, ranging from peaceful protests and civil disobedience to more disruptive forms of collective action, significantly influence their effectiveness.  The study of social movements thus requires analyzing not only their internal dynamics and organizational strategies but also the broader socio-political context within which they operate, including the prevailing power structures, prevailing ideologies, and the responses of state institutions.
