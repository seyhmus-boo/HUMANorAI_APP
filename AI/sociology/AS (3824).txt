This presentation explores the multifaceted and often contradictory effects of globalization on local cultures, focusing on the methodological challenges of empirically investigating such a complex phenomenon.  While globalization's impact is widely debated, rigorous empirical evidence remains scarce, hampered by inherent difficulties in defining and measuring both globalization and cultural preservation/change.  We identify three key experimental challenges: (1) **Defining the "local":**  Precisely delimiting geographical and social boundaries for cultural analysis is crucial, yet often contested, particularly in increasingly interconnected contexts. (2) **Causality and confounding variables:** Isolating the independent effect of globalization from other concurrent social, economic, and political processes impacting local cultures proves extremely difficult.  Establishing clear cause-and-effect relationships necessitates robust counterfactual analysis and sophisticated statistical techniques to control for confounding influences. (3) **Measurement of cultural change:**  Quantifying subtle shifts in cultural practices, beliefs, and values requires innovative methodologies beyond traditional survey approaches.  We will discuss the potential and limitations of utilizing ethnographic methods, digital footprint analysis, and mixed-methods approaches to address these challenges and suggest avenues for future research aiming to generate more robust empirical evidence regarding globalization's impact on local cultures.
