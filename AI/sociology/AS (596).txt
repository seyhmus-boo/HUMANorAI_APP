This presentation examines the complex interplay between education and the shaping of social norms, highlighting the inherent challenges in conducting rigorous experimental research within this field. While intuitively, education is posited to influence norms through knowledge transmission and critical thinking development, isolating its causal effect proves difficult.  We discuss the methodological hurdles encountered when attempting to experimentally manipulate educational interventions to measure their impact on norm adherence.  These challenges include the inherent difficulty in defining and measuring social norms across diverse contexts, the confounding influence of pre-existing individual beliefs and social networks, and the ethical considerations surrounding experimental manipulation of educational content related to sensitive social issues.  We present a review of existing literature illustrating these challenges, focusing on examples from studies exploring the effects of education on attitudes towards gender equality, environmental sustainability, and health behaviours.  Finally, we propose potential methodological advancements, such as the use of natural experiments, sophisticated statistical techniques to control for confounding variables, and the incorporation of qualitative data to enrich quantitative findings, to improve the rigor and validity of future research on this critical topic.
