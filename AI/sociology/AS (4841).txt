Social media's pervasive influence on human behavior warrants rigorous investigation. This lecture examines the multifaceted impact of these platforms, focusing on three key areas. Firstly, social comparison theory highlights the propensity for users to engage in upward social comparison, leading to feelings of inadequacy and negative self-evaluation.  Secondly, the curated nature of online profiles fosters unrealistic expectations of others' lives, contributing to anxiety and depression.  Finally, the addictive design of many platforms exploits psychological vulnerabilities, resulting in excessive usage and diminished real-world engagement.  While social media offers benefits such as connection and information dissemination, the inherent risks to mental wellbeing are considerable.  Further research is needed to elucidate the nuanced interplay between individual personality traits, platform usage patterns, and resultant behavioral changes.  Understanding these dynamics is crucial for mitigating negative consequences and promoting responsible technology usage.
