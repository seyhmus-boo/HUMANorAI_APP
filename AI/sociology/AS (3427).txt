This presentation examines the persistent and evolving nature of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on contemporary societies.  Recent developments, particularly the exacerbation of inequality during the COVID-19 pandemic and the rise of precarious work, have underscored the urgent need for renewed scholarly attention to this critical issue.  We will explore how these factors have reinforced existing disparities in health, education, and political participation, contributing to social instability and hindering societal progress.

The analysis will draw upon recent empirical studies highlighting the intergenerational transmission of inequality, focusing on the role of inherited wealth and access to quality resources. Furthermore, we will investigate the growing influence of algorithmic bias and automation on the labor market, deepening existing class divisions and creating new forms of economic vulnerability.  Finally, the presentation will briefly discuss emerging policy responses aimed at mitigating inequality, critically assessing their effectiveness and potential limitations.  By examining these recent trends, the presentation aims to foster a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics of class inequality and its profound implications for social cohesion and equitable development.
