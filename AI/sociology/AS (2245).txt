This presentation explores the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change, highlighting the crucial contribution of interdisciplinary scholarship to understanding their dynamics and impact.  While traditionally examined through sociological lenses, a comprehensive analysis requires integrating perspectives from history, political science, anthropology, and communication studies.  We will argue that the success or failure of a social movement is not solely determined by its internal organization or mobilization strategies, but rather by the complex interplay of factors across these disciplines.  Historical context shapes the emergence and trajectory of movements, while political science illuminates their interactions with state institutions and power structures.  Anthropological insights offer crucial understanding of cultural framing and identity construction within movements, while communication studies reveal the crucial role of media and narrative in shaping public opinion and mobilizing support.  The presentation will illustrate these interdisciplinary connections using case studies of diverse social movements, demonstrating how a holistic approach enhances our capacity to predict movement outcomes and evaluate their lasting effects on social structures, political landscapes, and cultural norms.  Ultimately, we contend that interdisciplinary research is essential for developing effective strategies for social change and promoting a more nuanced understanding of the powerful forces shaping our societies.
