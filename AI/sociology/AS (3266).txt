This paper investigates the complex relationship between economic policies and social well-being, examining the extent to which macroeconomic strategies influence key indicators of societal health.  We analyze a panel dataset spanning multiple developed and developing nations, controlling for factors such as demographic shifts, technological advancements, and institutional quality. Our findings suggest a nuanced relationship, where the effectiveness of specific policies varies considerably depending on contextual factors.  While pro-growth policies, such as investment in infrastructure and human capital, generally correlate positively with improved measures of well-being (e.g., life expectancy, Gini coefficient, subjective happiness), the impact is mediated by the distribution of economic gains.  Policies prioritizing equitable income distribution and social safety nets demonstrably mitigate inequality and enhance subjective well-being, even in periods of slower economic growth.  Conversely, austerity measures implemented without corresponding social support mechanisms are associated with negative consequences for mental health and social cohesion.  These results highlight the crucial need for policy design that considers not just economic growth but also its distributional effects and the promotion of inclusive social outcomes to achieve genuine social well-being.
