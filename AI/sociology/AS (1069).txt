Social movements, collective actions aimed at achieving social or political change, have profoundly shaped societies throughout history.  From the abolitionist movement challenging slavery to the suffrage movement advocating for women's voting rights, their impact is undeniable. Historically, movements have emerged within specific socio-political contexts, often fuelled by grievances stemming from inequality, injustice, or oppression.  Early movements were largely localized and relied on personal networks, exemplified by the Luddite revolts against industrialization.  However, advancements in communication and transportation facilitated the rise of larger, more organized movements in the 20th and 21st centuries, such as the Civil Rights Movement and the global anti-globalization movement.

The effectiveness of social movements in driving societal change is contingent upon various factors.  Resource mobilization theory emphasizes the importance of acquiring and utilizing resources such as funding, manpower, and media attention.  Political opportunity structures, including the openness of the political system and the presence of elite allies, play a crucial role in determining a movement's success.  Furthermore, framing – the way a movement constructs its message and goals – significantly influences public opinion and participation.  Ultimately, the lasting impact of a social movement depends not only on its immediate achievements but also on its ability to reshape broader social norms, values, and institutions.
