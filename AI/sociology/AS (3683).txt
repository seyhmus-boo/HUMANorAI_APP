This presentation explores the crucial role of education in shaping and reshaping social norms.  While often implicitly assumed, the mechanisms through which education influences societal values remain under-examined. We argue that education acts as a powerful socializing agent, impacting norm formation across multiple levels.  Firstly, formal curricula, beyond imparting knowledge, transmit values and beliefs, explicitly or implicitly endorsing certain behaviours while discouraging others. Secondly, the hidden curriculum – encompassing school culture, peer interactions, and disciplinary practices – significantly influences students' internalization of social norms.  Thirdly, education fosters critical thinking, empowering individuals to question and challenge existing norms, paving the way for social change.

Practical applications of this understanding are manifold.  Curriculum development can be strategically designed to promote prosocial behaviours, tolerance, and critical engagement with societal issues like gender equality or environmental sustainability.  Teacher training should emphasize the importance of modelling desired behaviours and fostering inclusive classroom environments.  Furthermore, research on the effectiveness of educational interventions in shifting specific norms, such as those related to health behaviours or political participation, can inform policy and practice. By acknowledging and harnessing the multifaceted influence of education, we can leverage its transformative potential to create more equitable and just societies.
