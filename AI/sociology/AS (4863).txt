The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, defying simple causal inference. While macroeconomic policies aiming for growth, stability, and equity ostensibly improve social well-being (measured via metrics like poverty rates, health outcomes, and life satisfaction), establishing direct causality is experimentally challenging.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard for causal inference, are rarely feasible at the societal level due to ethical and practical constraints.  Large-scale policy interventions affect diverse populations heterogeneously, making it difficult to isolate the treatment effect from confounding factors like pre-existing social inequalities or concurrent policy changes.

Furthermore, the long-term impacts of economic policies are often difficult to assess, requiring extensive longitudinal data collection and analysis.  The measurement of social well-being itself presents significant challenges, with subjective measures like happiness and life satisfaction exhibiting considerable individual variation and potentially influenced by factors unrelated to economic policies.  Consequently, observational studies, while offering a more practical approach, are susceptible to endogeneity bias, hindering precise conclusions regarding the effectiveness of specific economic interventions in promoting social well-being.
