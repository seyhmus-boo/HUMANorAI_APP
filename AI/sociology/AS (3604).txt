This presentation explores the dynamics of social movements and their capacity for societal change through a novel lens: quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate, the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement offer valuable insights into the seemingly unpredictable and emergent nature of collective action. We argue that the initial stages of a social movement can be conceptualized as a superposition of potential outcomes, where multiple narratives and strategies coexist with varying probabilities.  Activists, through their interactions and the dissemination of information, act as catalysts, influencing the collapse of this superposition into a dominant narrative and course of action.  Entanglement, then, captures the interconnectedness of individual actions and beliefs within the movement; a change in one individual's commitment can resonate across the network, amplifying the movement's overall impact.  This perspective offers a framework for understanding the rapid growth and unpredictable shifts often observed in social movements.  By considering the non-linear and probabilistic nature of collective behavior, akin to quantum systems, we can develop more nuanced models of social change, moving beyond deterministic approaches and acknowledging the crucial role of uncertainty and emergent properties in the transformative power of collective action.  The presentation will further discuss the implications of this framework for understanding both successful and unsuccessful movements, and propose future avenues for research at the intersection of social science and quantum theory.
