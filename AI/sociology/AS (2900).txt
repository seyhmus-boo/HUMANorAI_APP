This study investigates the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, drawing upon insights from economics, sociology, and political science.  While traditional economic models often focus on aggregate measures like GDP, this research emphasizes a multidimensional perspective encompassing subjective well-being, health outcomes, social equity, and environmental sustainability.  We analyze the impact of various policy instruments, including fiscal policies (taxation, social welfare programs), monetary policies (interest rates, inflation control), and regulatory policies (labor market regulations, environmental protections), on these diverse indicators of social well-being.  Employing a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative econometric analysis with qualitative case studies, we explore the mediating role of social capital and institutional factors in shaping the relationship between economic policies and their societal consequences.  Preliminary findings suggest that a narrow focus on economic growth alone may be insufficient for achieving broad social well-being; instead, policies that prioritize equity, social inclusion, and environmental considerations are essential for fostering a more just and sustainable society.  Further research should explore the long-term effects of policy interventions and the potential for policy trade-offs between different dimensions of well-being.
