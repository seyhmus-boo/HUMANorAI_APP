The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being constitutes a central theme in contemporary social science research, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to fully comprehend its multifaceted nature.  While traditional economics often prioritizes macroeconomic indicators like GDP growth, a comprehensive understanding necessitates incorporating insights from sociology, political science, psychology, and public health. This paper explores the complex interplay between economic strategies and societal outcomes, moving beyond simplistic correlations to analyze the mediating factors that shape the impact of policy choices.  We examine how fiscal policies, such as taxation and social welfare programs, influence not only material living standards but also broader dimensions of well-being encompassing mental health, social cohesion, and environmental sustainability.  Furthermore, we consider the distributional effects of economic policies, acknowledging that aggregate measures can obscure significant inequalities impacting specific demographics.  By integrating diverse theoretical perspectives and empirical evidence, this research aims to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how economic policy design can effectively promote equitable and sustainable social well-being.
