This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, drawing upon interdisciplinary insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and political science.  We argue that while cultural diversity presents significant opportunities for innovation and enriched social life, its impact on social integration is complex and contingent upon various factors.  Sociological perspectives on social capital and group formation will be examined to understand how diverse populations build connections and navigate potential tensions. Anthropological lenses illuminate the role of cultural practices and values in shaping interactions and perceptions of "otherness."  Psychological research on intergroup contact and prejudice will be integrated to analyze the individual-level dynamics influencing integration processes.  Finally, political science contributions regarding policy frameworks, citizenship, and multiculturalism will be considered to demonstrate the crucial role of institutional mechanisms in fostering inclusive societies.  The presentation will critically assess existing literature and highlight the need for interdisciplinary collaborations to develop effective strategies promoting positive social integration in diverse societies, ultimately moving beyond simplistic narratives of assimilation or multiculturalism.  This requires understanding the interplay of structural, cultural, and individual factors influencing integration outcomes.
