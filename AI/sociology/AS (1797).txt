Education has historically played a pivotal role in shaping social norms, acting as both a reflector and a shaper of prevailing cultural values.  Early forms of education, often religious or vocational, reinforced existing societal structures and norms through transmission of traditional knowledge and skills.  However, the rise of mass education in the 19th and 20th centuries introduced a new dynamic.  While initially perpetuating existing hierarchies and biases, educational systems also became sites of social reform, promoting literacy, critical thinking, and exposure to diverse perspectives.  This fostered the development of new norms, including those related to gender equality, human rights, and environmental stewardship.  Contemporary research highlights the influence of curriculum content, pedagogical approaches, and school-based social interactions on the internalization and propagation of social norms.  For example, inclusive curricula can challenge discriminatory attitudes, while participatory teaching methods can cultivate empathy and prosocial behavior.  However, the effectiveness of education in norm transformation is contingent upon broader societal factors, including political will, economic conditions, and the presence of reinforcing institutional mechanisms.  Further research is needed to explore the complex interplay between education and social change, accounting for the heterogeneity of educational systems and their varied impacts across different sociocultural contexts.
