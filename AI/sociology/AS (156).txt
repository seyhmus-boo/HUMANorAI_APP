While seemingly disparate, the concept of class inequality and quantum mechanical principles offer a compelling, albeit metaphorical, framework for understanding societal stratification.  Consider the societal "wave function," a superposition of various socio-economic states representing different class positions.  The probability amplitude associated with each state – representing the likelihood of an individual occupying a particular class – is heavily influenced by inherited factors (akin to initial conditions in a quantum system) and external societal "potentials" (e.g., systemic biases, access to education and resources).  High inequality manifests as a wave function sharply peaked around low-energy (low-socioeconomic status) states, with a negligible probability amplitude for high-energy (high-socioeconomic status) states for a significant portion of the population.  This "collapse" of the wave function into a predominantly low-energy state signifies a system lacking quantum "entanglement" – the lack of significant social mobility. The resultant societal "ground state" is characterized by reduced overall societal "energy" (e.g., lower economic productivity, higher crime rates, poorer health outcomes), analogous to a system trapped in a low-energy well.  Addressing inequality, therefore, requires manipulating the societal potential, providing pathways for upward mobility, and promoting a more equitable distribution of societal resources – effectively creating a more evenly distributed probability amplitude across the different socio-economic states, enhancing societal overall potential.
