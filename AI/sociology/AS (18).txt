Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies throughout history, continues to pose a significant challenge to social cohesion and economic development.  From the stratified societies of ancient civilizations, evidenced by disparities in access to resources and power, to the feudal systems of medieval Europe with their rigid hierarchical structures, economic stratification has consistently shaped social relations and outcomes. The Industrial Revolution, while fostering unprecedented economic growth, simultaneously exacerbated class divisions, creating a stark contrast between a burgeoning capitalist class and a largely impoverished working class.  This period witnessed the emergence of Marxist thought, which critically analyzed the inherent inequalities of capitalism and predicted its eventual overthrow.  However, the 20th and 21st centuries have demonstrated the persistence and adaptability of class inequality, manifesting in new and nuanced forms despite significant social and political changes. This paper examines the multifaceted effects of class inequality on contemporary society, exploring its impact on areas such as health outcomes, educational attainment, political participation, and social mobility.  It will further analyze the complex interplay between class, race, and gender in shaping lived experiences and perpetuating systemic disadvantage.
