The evolution of gender roles in modern societies is a complex process, best understood through analogy.  Initially, societal structures regarding gender resembled a rigid, hierarchical binary code:  a computer program operating on only two inputs, male and female, each with pre-assigned functions.  Men, analogous to the "primary function" of a machine, were largely confined to the public sphere – the "operating system" –  while women, likened to "support modules," primarily occupied the domestic sphere. This binary, however, is increasingly becoming obsolete.  Modern societies are transitioning toward a more nuanced operating system, akin to an open-source program.  Individual capabilities and aspirations, previously ignored or suppressed, are now being integrated as diverse "add-ons" and "plugins," blurring the lines of traditional gender roles.  This process, however, is not uniform.  Some societies are undergoing faster transformations, operating on updated software, while others remain tethered to older, more restrictive models.  Resistance to change, comparable to system errors or "bugs" in the code, still persists,  manifesting as deeply ingrained biases and discriminatory practices. Consequently, studying this evolution requires examining the intricate interplay of societal, economic, and political factors— akin to debugging a complex program to understand its performance and uncover the root causes of its inconsistencies.
