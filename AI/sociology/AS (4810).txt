This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of social media on human behavior, focusing on both individual and collective-level effects.  While social media platforms offer unprecedented opportunities for connection and information dissemination, their influence on behavior remains a subject of ongoing debate. We explore the documented impact of social media on mental health, considering the links between usage patterns, self-esteem, body image, and the prevalence of anxiety and depression.  Furthermore, we analyze the role of social media in shaping political attitudes and behaviors, examining phenomena such as echo chambers, filter bubbles, and the spread of misinformation.  The presentation also considers the influence of social media on social comparison, consumer behavior, and the formation of online identities. By reviewing empirical evidence from various disciplines, including psychology, sociology, and communication studies, we aim to provide a nuanced perspective on the complex relationship between social media and human behavior, highlighting both the positive and negative consequences of this pervasive technological influence and offering suggestions for future research.  Finally, we briefly discuss potential strategies for mitigating the negative impacts and harnessing the positive potential of social media for societal benefit.
