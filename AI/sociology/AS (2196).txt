This presentation examines the role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on the inherent experimental challenges in studying their efficacy.  While social movements demonstrably impact societal norms and structures, rigorous causal inference remains elusive.  The inherent difficulties lie in the multifaceted nature of movement mobilization, the lack of control groups, and the often-unpredictable interplay of various factors, including counter-movements and pre-existing social conditions.  We explore several methodological approaches attempting to address these challenges, including comparative case studies, process tracing, and the use of quantitative data where available, highlighting their strengths and limitations.  The presentation will critically assess the limitations of existing methodologies and propose avenues for future research, such as utilizing mixed-methods designs and focusing on specific, measurable outcomes linked to movement activities.  Ultimately, we argue that a more nuanced understanding of social movements requires embracing the complexities of their inherently experimental nature, moving beyond simplistic success/failure narratives to a more robust assessment of their impact on societal transformation.
