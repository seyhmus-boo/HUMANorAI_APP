This presentation examines the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, focusing on recent developments that challenge simplistic narratives of homogenization versus fragmentation.  While globalization has undeniably facilitated the spread of global cultural products and practices, leading to concerns about cultural imperialism and the erosion of local traditions, recent research highlights a more nuanced reality.  We will explore the concept of "glocalization," analyzing how global cultural elements are adapted and reinterpreted within specific local contexts, generating hybrid cultural forms.  Furthermore, the rise of digital technologies has empowered local communities to actively participate in global cultural flows, fostering both resistance and creative appropriation.  Examples will be drawn from recent studies exploring the impact of globalization on indigenous communities' efforts to maintain their cultural heritage in the face of global market pressures, as well as the emergence of localized versions of global social media platforms and online communities.  The presentation concludes by arguing that the relationship between globalization and local cultures is dynamic and complex, characterized by both challenges and opportunities for cultural innovation and resilience.
