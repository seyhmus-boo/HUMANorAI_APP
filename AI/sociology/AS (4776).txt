Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the persistent challenge of empirically demonstrating the societal effects of class inequality. While the existence of inequality is readily observable, isolating its precise impact proves remarkably difficult.  Correlation does not equal causation;  wealth disparities often coincide with other societal factors – ethnicity, geography, and access to education – confounding attempts at causal inference.

Experimental approaches, ideal for establishing causality, face significant limitations.  Randomly assigning individuals to different socioeconomic strata is, ethically and practically, impossible.  Natural experiments, such as comparing geographically proximate areas with differing levels of inequality, are often hampered by unobservable confounders.  Furthermore, long-term effects are challenging to track, demanding longitudinal studies susceptible to attrition bias.  These methodological hurdles highlight the complexities inherent in rigorously establishing the precise relationship between class inequality and downstream societal consequences, such as reduced social mobility, increased crime rates, and compromised public health outcomes.  Further methodological innovation is required to address these profound experimental challenges.
