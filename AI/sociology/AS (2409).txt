Education's impact on society transcends the acquisition of knowledge; it acts as a powerful sculptor of social norms.  Like a potter shaping clay, education molds individual behavior and beliefs, contributing significantly to the overall societal form.  The curriculum, pedagogical approaches, and even the very structure of educational institutions serve as the tools in this process.  This research paper explores the multifaceted ways in which education shapes social norms, moving beyond a simple transmission of information model.  We argue that education acts not merely as a conveyor belt delivering pre-existing norms, but rather as a dynamic engine actively generating and reinforcing them.  This can be likened to a gardener cultivating a specific type of plant â€“ education carefully cultivates desired behaviours and beliefs, nurturing some while suppressing others through reward systems, social interaction, and the dissemination of specific values and ideologies.  We will investigate this complex interplay by examining the role of hidden curricula, the influence of peer interaction within educational settings, and the impact of specific educational policies on the evolution and maintenance of social norms across diverse cultural contexts.  Our analysis will illuminate how education, as a social institution, plays a pivotal role in both preserving existing societal structures and facilitating social change.
