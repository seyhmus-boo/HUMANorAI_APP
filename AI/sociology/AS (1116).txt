This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, highlighting the crucial interdisciplinary contributions needed to fully understand this complex phenomenon.  While cultural diversity often enriches societies, its impact on social integration is neither uniformly positive nor negative, varying significantly across contexts and depending on prevailing social structures and policies.  We argue that a holistic approach, drawing on insights from sociology, anthropology, psychology, and political science, is essential for effective analysis.  Sociology provides frameworks for understanding social stratification and group relations, while anthropology offers nuanced perspectives on cultural values and practices.  Psychology illuminates the cognitive and emotional processes involved in intergroup interactions and prejudice reduction, while political science examines the role of institutions and policies in fostering or hindering integration.  The presentation will examine case studies illustrating the interplay of these factors, analyzing successful integration strategies and identifying challenges posed by diverse cultural backgrounds.  Ultimately, we advocate for an interdisciplinary approach to policy-making that accounts for the multifaceted nature of cultural diversity and its impact on social cohesion.
