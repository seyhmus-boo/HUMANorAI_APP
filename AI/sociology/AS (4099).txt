Rapid urbanization, a defining characteristic of the 21st century, profoundly reshapes community life, presenting both challenges and opportunities.  Traditional, close-knit communities, often rooted in shared geography and long-standing social networks, are increasingly fragmented by the influx of diverse populations and the rise of virtual interactions.  Recent research highlights the consequent decline in social capital, manifested in reduced civic engagement and increased social isolation, particularly amongst vulnerable populations.  However, urbanization also fosters the emergence of new forms of community.  Digital platforms facilitate the formation of online communities based on shared interests, transcending geographical boundaries.  Furthermore, urban spaces themselves are increasingly designed to promote social interaction, with the proliferation of co-working spaces, community gardens, and public plazas fostering a sense of belonging amongst diverse residents.  Contemporary scholarship emphasizes the crucial role of urban planning and policy in mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization while leveraging its potential to create vibrant and inclusive communities.  The success of such initiatives hinges on inclusive participatory processes that ensure equitable access to resources and opportunities for all residents, irrespective of socioeconomic background or cultural origin.
