Class inequality, a persistent societal feature throughout history, manifests as the uneven distribution of resources, power, and opportunities based on social stratification.  Historically, feudal systems rigidly defined class, with nobility enjoying immense privilege while serfs endured hardship.  The Industrial Revolution, while fostering economic growth, exacerbated inequality, creating a stark divide between a burgeoning capitalist class and a largely impoverished working class.  This disparity continues to shape modern societies, albeit in more nuanced forms.

The effects of class inequality are multifaceted and profoundly damaging.  High levels of inequality are correlated with diminished social mobility, hindering individual advancement and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  Furthermore, it fosters social unrest and political instability, as marginalized groups may resort to protest or violence in pursuit of fairer representation.  Increased inequality also negatively impacts public health, education, and overall societal well-being, resulting in decreased life expectancy and increased crime rates among disadvantaged populations. Addressing this complex issue necessitates a multi-pronged approach targeting economic policies, educational reform, and social welfare initiatives.
