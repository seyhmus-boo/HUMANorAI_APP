This presentation examines the evolving role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on recent developments that challenge traditional understandings of collective action.  While classic theories emphasize centralized organization and clear goals, contemporary movements often exhibit decentralized structures facilitated by digital technologies, leading to new forms of mobilization and communication.  We will explore the implications of this "networked activism," analyzing its successes and limitations in achieving desired societal transformations.  Specifically, the presentation will analyze the impact of social media on movement formation and sustainability, contrasting its effectiveness in amplifying marginalized voices with the potential for manipulation and the creation of echo chambers.  Furthermore, we will discuss the rise of transnational solidarity networks, highlighting both their capacity for global impact and the challenges of coordinating diverse agendas and overcoming geographical barriers.  Finally, we will consider the ongoing debates surrounding the effectiveness of different mobilization strategies,  emphasizing the need for nuanced analyses that account for the diverse contexts in which social movements operate.
