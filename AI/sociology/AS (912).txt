Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, marked by both homogenization and heterogenization. This presentation examines the nuanced effects of globalization on local cultural practices, focusing on the interplay between global flows of information, capital, and people, and the resilience of localized traditions.  We explore the extent to which globalization fosters cultural convergence, leading to the adoption of globalized norms and the erosion of unique cultural expressions. Conversely, we analyze how globalization can paradoxically invigorate local cultures, prompting revitalization efforts and the strategic deployment of cultural identity as a form of resistance or commodification.  The presentation draws upon case studies from diverse geographical contexts to illustrate these competing dynamics, highlighting the agency of local communities in shaping their own cultural futures within a globalized world. We argue that a nuanced understanding requires moving beyond simplistic narratives of cultural dominance and embrace a more dynamic perspective recognizing both the threats and opportunities presented by globalization for local cultures. The findings suggest a need for policies that support cultural diversity and empower local communities in navigating the complexities of global interconnectedness.
