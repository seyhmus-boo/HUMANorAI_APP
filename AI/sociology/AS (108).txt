Social media's pervasive influence on contemporary life necessitates a comprehensive understanding of its impact on human behavior. This research paper examines the multifaceted effects of social media platforms, moving beyond simplistic narratives of positive or negative impacts to explore the complex interplay of psychological, sociological, and technological factors at play.  We adopt an interdisciplinary approach, drawing upon insights from psychology (specifically, self-perception theory and social comparison theory), sociology (considering the impact on social capital and community formation), and computer science (analyzing algorithmic design and its effects on information consumption and behavioral manipulation). This integrated framework allows for a nuanced analysis beyond singular disciplinary boundaries, recognizing that social media's influence is not merely a matter of individual choices but is deeply embedded within complex social and technological systems.  We will explore how these systems shape user behaviors, including online communication styles, information seeking habits, and the formation of identity, ultimately aiming to provide a more complete and insightful understanding of social media's profound and pervasive effects on human behavior in the 21st century.
