The enduring influence of education on societal structures is a topic of ongoing scholarly debate, with its role in shaping social norms occupying a central position.  Historically, formal education systems have served not only to transmit knowledge and skills, but also to instill specific values and beliefs reflecting the dominant ideology of the time.  From the ancient Greek emphasis on civic virtue through the medieval Church's promotion of religious doctrine to the nation-state's inculcation of patriotism in the modern era, educational institutions have consistently functioned as agents of socialization, reinforcing existing social norms or, occasionally, challenging them.  This paper examines the complex interplay between education and social norm formation, analyzing how educational practices, curricula, and institutional structures contribute to the reproduction and transformation of societal expectations and behaviors.  We will explore diverse theoretical perspectives, considering both the intended and unintended consequences of educational interventions on norm adherence and social change.  By investigating empirical evidence from various historical and contemporary contexts, this study aims to illuminate the nuanced mechanisms through which education shapes – and is shaped by – prevailing social norms.
