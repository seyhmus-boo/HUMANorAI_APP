Social movements, defined as organized collective efforts to promote or resist societal change, play a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of societies.  Their influence extends beyond mere protest, encompassing the articulation of grievances, the mobilization of resources, and the construction of alternative social realities.  Recent developments highlight a shift towards networked and digitally-mediated mobilization, significantly altering the dynamics of social movement organization and impact. The rise of social media platforms facilitates rapid dissemination of information, expands the geographical reach of activism, and enables the formation of transnational solidarity networks, as witnessed in the #MeToo movement and global climate activism.  However, this digital reliance also presents challenges, including the spread of misinformation and the potential for state surveillance and censorship.  Furthermore, contemporary movements are increasingly characterized by decentralized structures and fluid participation, potentially resulting in both enhanced inclusivity and difficulties in sustaining sustained collective action.  Analyzing the interplay between these digital affordances and inherent organizational complexities is crucial for understanding the evolving impact of social movements on contemporary societal transformations, including shifts in policy, norms, and cultural values.
