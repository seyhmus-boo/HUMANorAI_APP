Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, play a crucial role in effecting societal change.  Recent scholarship emphasizes their multifaceted nature, moving beyond earlier resource mobilization and political process models to incorporate framing, identity, and emotion.  Contemporary movements increasingly utilize digital technologies, facilitating transnational mobilization and rapid information dissemination, as evidenced by the #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements.  These digital tools, however, also present challenges, including the spread of misinformation and the potential for surveillance and repression.

Furthermore,  the rise of populism and increasingly polarized political landscapes have significantly impacted the strategies and effectiveness of social movements.  While some achieve substantial policy changes, as seen with the LGBTQ+ rights movement in many Western nations, others face significant state-sponsored repression, highlighting the complex interplay between movement tactics and state responses.  The ongoing influence of globalization and interconnectedness complicates analysis, as movements navigate both local and transnational contexts.  Future research should focus on the evolving relationship between digital technologies, political polarization, and the capacity of social movements to achieve lasting societal transformation.
