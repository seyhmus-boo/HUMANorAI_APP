Good morning. Today's lecture focuses on class inequality and its societal ramifications, particularly in light of recent developments.  While class stratification has always existed, recent decades have witnessed a concerning resurgence of inequality, driven by factors including globalization, technological advancements, and stagnant wages for many.  This widening gap manifests in disparate access to resources – healthcare, education, and housing – impacting life expectancy, educational attainment, and overall well-being disproportionately.

Recent research highlights the intergenerational transmission of inequality, with socioeconomic background strongly predicting future outcomes.  This perpetuates cycles of poverty and limits social mobility, undermining the meritocratic ideal.  Furthermore, high levels of inequality are increasingly linked to social unrest, political polarization, and declining social cohesion, evidenced by rising populism and decreased trust in institutions.  Addressing this complex issue requires multifaceted approaches, encompassing progressive taxation, robust social safety nets, and investments in education and skills development to foster a more equitable and just society.  We will now delve deeper into specific contributing factors.
