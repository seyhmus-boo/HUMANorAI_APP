This presentation explores the multifaceted role of education in shaping societal norms across historical periods.  Historically, education systems have served as powerful instruments of both social cohesion and control.  From ancient Greece, where education fostered civic virtue and adherence to the polis, to the rise of mass education in the 19th and 20th centuries, curricula have actively promoted specific values and behaviors considered essential for societal stability.  This often involved the transmission of dominant cultural narratives, reinforcing existing power structures and social hierarchies.

However, education’s influence is not unidirectional.  Critical pedagogy and progressive educational movements have challenged this status quo, highlighting education’s potential to foster critical thinking, social justice, and the questioning of established norms.  This presentation will analyze how educational practices, including curriculum content, pedagogical approaches, and institutional structures, have shaped – and continue to shape – norms related to gender, race, class, and environmental responsibility.  It will examine examples of both the reinforcement and the challenge of social norms through educational interventions, emphasizing the inherent tension between transmitting cultural heritage and fostering social change.  Finally, the presentation will consider the implications for contemporary education in navigating this complex relationship.
