This paper explores the societal ramifications of class inequality through the lens of quantum mechanical principles, specifically focusing on the concept of entanglement and superposition. We posit that societal structures, analogous to quantum systems, exhibit emergent properties arising from the entangled states of individual agents' socioeconomic positions.  Class inequality, represented as an uneven distribution of resources and opportunities, introduces a bias into this entanglement, limiting the superposition of potential societal outcomes.  This bias manifests as a suppression of certain pathways towards equitable social states, favoring those that reinforce existing hierarchies.  We propose a model where the energy landscape of the social system is sculpted by class inequality, creating deep potential wells corresponding to persistent inequality.  Escape from these wells, representing societal shifts towards greater equity, requires a significant input of energy, analogous to overcoming large energy barriers in quantum tunneling.  The probability of such transitions, we argue, is inversely proportional to the degree of inequality, suggesting that reducing class disparity is crucial for unlocking a wider superposition of possible social futures and achieving a more dynamic and equitable society.  Further research is needed to develop more robust quantitative models that capture the complex entanglement dynamics within socioeconomic systems.
