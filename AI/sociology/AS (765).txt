Social media's pervasive influence on human behavior necessitates an interdisciplinary approach to fully understand its multifaceted impacts. This abstract synthesizes findings across psychology, sociology, communication studies, and neuroscience, highlighting key effects.  Psychological research reveals social media's contribution to both enhanced social connection and increased social comparison, potentially leading to heightened anxiety and depression.  Sociological studies demonstrate the platform's role in shaping social norms, influencing political polarization, and facilitating the spread of misinformation.  Communication studies analyze the impact of algorithmic curation on information consumption and the formation of echo chambers.  Furthermore, neuroscientific investigations unveil the neurobiological mechanisms underlying social media addiction and its effects on reward pathways and attentional processes.  While offering unprecedented opportunities for communication and community building, social media presents significant challenges related to mental health, social cohesion, and information integrity.  Future research should prioritize longitudinal studies employing mixed-methods approaches to better elucidate the complex interplay between social media usage and human behavior across diverse populations and contexts.
