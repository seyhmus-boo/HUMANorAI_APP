Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, transcends disciplinary boundaries, demanding an interdisciplinary approach to its analysis and mitigation.  Sociologists highlight the perpetuation of inequality through inherited wealth, unequal access to education and resources, and discriminatory practices.  This unequal distribution of capital, as economists demonstrate, leads to disparities in health outcomes, as evidenced by public health research showing a correlation between socioeconomic status and life expectancy.  Furthermore, political science reveals how class inequality influences political representation, with disadvantaged groups often having less voice and power in shaping policy.  Psychology sheds light on the individual-level consequences, including increased stress and diminished mental well-being among lower socioeconomic groups.  Understanding class inequality requires a holistic lens encompassing these diverse perspectives, revealing its complex and multifaceted impact on societal stability, social mobility, and overall well-being.  Ignoring the interconnectedness of these disciplines risks incomplete and ineffective solutions.
