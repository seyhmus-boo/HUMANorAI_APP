This presentation explores the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change, emphasizing the crucial interdisciplinary insights needed for a comprehensive understanding.  While traditionally analyzed through sociological lenses, examining social movements requires a holistic approach incorporating perspectives from political science, history, anthropology, and communication studies.  We will argue that successful movements leverage strategic communication to frame narratives, mobilize resources, and cultivate collective identity, as explored through the lens of framing theory and rhetorical analysis.  Furthermore, the historical context – including existing power structures and socio-economic inequalities – profoundly shapes the trajectory and impact of movements, highlighting the importance of historical analysis.  Anthropological perspectives enrich our understanding of cultural practices and symbolic actions within movements, while political science illuminates the interplay between movements and state institutions. By synthesizing these diverse approaches, we aim to showcase the complex interplay of factors that contribute to both the successes and failures of social movements in effecting lasting societal transformation.  The presentation will conclude with a discussion of emerging challenges and opportunities for future research.
