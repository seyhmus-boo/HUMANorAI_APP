Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and goals, are pivotal agents of societal change.  However, empirically assessing their impact presents significant methodological challenges. This presentation explores these experimental hurdles in understanding the relationship between social movements and societal transformation.  We examine the difficulties in isolating the causal effects of movements from other concurrent social and political factors, particularly within complex, multi-layered societal contexts.  The inherent difficulty in randomly assigning individuals to “movement participation” and “control” groups necessitates exploring alternative quasi-experimental designs and leveraging natural experiments, such as geographically localized movements or policy shifts triggered by movement activity.  Further complexities arise from the diversity of movement strategies, the dynamic nature of mobilization, and the long-term, often indirect, consequences of activism.  We will discuss the limitations of existing methodologies, including event history analysis and regression discontinuity designs, and propose avenues for future research, such as agent-based modelling and the integration of qualitative and quantitative data to provide a more nuanced understanding of movement efficacy in driving societal change.  Finally, we will highlight the ethical considerations inherent in studying social movements.
