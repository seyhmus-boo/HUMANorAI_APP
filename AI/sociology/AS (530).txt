Urbanization, the escalating concentration of human populations in urban areas, is a defining feature of the 21st century, impacting community life in profound and multifaceted ways.  While historical trends have documented the erosion of traditional community structures alongside urban growth, recent developments necessitate a reassessment of these established narratives.  The rise of digital technologies, particularly social media and online platforms, has created novel avenues for community engagement and formation, potentially mitigating some of the isolating effects of high-density living.  Simultaneously,  growing socio-economic inequalities within cities exacerbate existing social fragmentation, leading to the emergence of geographically and socially segregated communities.  This paper examines the complex interplay between urbanization and community life, moving beyond simplistic narratives of decline. We analyze recent research focusing on the mediating roles of technology,  the impact of urban planning policies on social cohesion, and the evolving nature of social capital in diverse urban settings.  By exploring these interlinked factors, we aim to provide a nuanced understanding of the ongoing transformations in urban community structures and their implications for social well-being.
