This presentation examines the crucial role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on inherent experimental challenges in their study. While social movements demonstrably reshape norms, policies, and power structures, their analysis faces methodological hurdles.  The inherent dynamism and unpredictability of movements complicate the establishment of control groups and the isolation of causal mechanisms.  This presentation will discuss the limitations of traditional quantitative methods, such as regression analysis, when applied to the complex, emergent properties of collective action.  It will then explore the potential and limitations of qualitative approaches, including ethnography and narrative analysis, highlighting their strengths in capturing the nuances of mobilization processes and framing strategies, but acknowledging issues of researcher bias and generalizability.  Finally, the presentation will propose a mixed-methods approach, advocating for the integration of quantitative and qualitative data to produce a more robust understanding of movement efficacy and the broader societal impacts of collective action, specifically addressing the challenges of establishing counterfactuals and measuring long-term consequences.  The goal is to foster a more nuanced and rigorous examination of the relationship between social movements and social transformation.
