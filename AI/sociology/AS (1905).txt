Class inequality, a persistent societal feature throughout history, refers to the unequal distribution of resources, opportunities, and power among different social groups.  Historically, feudal systems epitomized this disparity, with rigid hierarchies determining access to land and influence.  The industrial revolution, while generating wealth, exacerbated inequality through the emergence of a capitalist class and a burgeoning proletariat.  This disparity wasn't merely economic; it manifested in unequal access to education, healthcare, and political representation, perpetuating a cycle of disadvantage.

The consequences of significant class inequality are multifaceted and deeply impactful.  Increased crime rates and social unrest are frequently observed in societies with pronounced stratification.  Furthermore, economic stagnation can result from limited consumer demand among lower classes and restricted access to talent and innovation.  Health outcomes are demonstrably affected, with lower life expectancies and higher morbidity rates prevalent among disadvantaged populations.  Ultimately, pronounced class inequality undermines social cohesion and democratic ideals, leading to instability and hindering societal progress.
