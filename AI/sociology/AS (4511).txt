Education has historically played a pivotal role in shaping and reinforcing social norms, functioning as both a transmitter of existing cultural values and a catalyst for social change.  Early educational systems, often religiously or state-sponsored, primarily focused on the transmission of established norms, promoting conformity and social order.  However, the Enlightenment and subsequent social movements leveraged education to challenge existing power structures and advocate for new norms, highlighting its capacity for both conservative and progressive functions.  This abstract explores the multifaceted relationship between education and social norms, examining how curricula, pedagogical approaches, and the broader educational context influence the internalization and transmission of societal expectations.  Research indicates a strong correlation between educational attainment and the adoption of norms related to health, civic engagement, and gender equality.  However, the effectiveness of education in shaping norms is contingent upon factors such as the alignment of educational goals with broader societal values, the quality of instruction, and the presence of supportive social environments.  Further research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay between education, socialization, and the dynamic evolution of social norms across diverse cultural settings.
