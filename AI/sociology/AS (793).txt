Class inequality, the uneven distribution of resources and opportunities across social strata, exerts a profound and multifaceted impact on society.  Its consequences extend beyond individual hardship, manifesting in systemic issues that impede societal progress.  For instance, unequal access to quality education perpetuates intergenerational poverty, limiting social mobility and hindering the development of a skilled workforce.  Furthermore, disparities in healthcare access lead to significant health discrepancies, impacting life expectancy and productivity.  The concentration of wealth in the hands of a minority fuels political polarization and undermines democratic processes, as the wealthy wield disproportionate influence on policy decisions.  Critically, high levels of inequality are associated with increased crime rates and social unrest, straining public resources and fostering social instability.  Practical applications of understanding class inequality include implementing progressive taxation policies to redistribute wealth, investing in affordable housing and universal healthcare, and promoting educational equity through targeted interventions and scholarships.  Addressing these systemic issues requires a multi-pronged approach, encompassing both social welfare programs and broader structural reforms to mitigate the damaging societal effects of persistent class divides.
