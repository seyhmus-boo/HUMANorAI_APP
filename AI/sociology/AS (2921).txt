The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being has been a central theme in economic and political discourse for centuries.  Historically, laissez-faire capitalism, dominant from the 18th century onwards, prioritized economic growth with minimal state intervention, often resulting in stark inequalities and social unrest.  The Great Depression of the 1930s starkly exposed the limitations of this approach, prompting the rise of Keynesian economics and the expansion of the welfare state in many nations.  This shift emphasized government intervention to manage aggregate demand, mitigate economic fluctuations, and provide social safety nets, aiming to improve overall societal well-being through initiatives like unemployment benefits and public healthcare.

However, the latter half of the 20th century witnessed a renewed focus on neoliberal policies, advocating deregulation, privatization, and fiscal austerity.  This approach, while promoting economic efficiency in some contexts, has also been criticized for exacerbating income inequality and undermining social safety nets. This paper will explore the complex interplay between various economic policy paradigms – from laissez-faire to Keynesianism and neoliberalism – and their consequent impact on diverse dimensions of social well-being, including health, education, income distribution, and social cohesion. We will critically examine the empirical evidence supporting different perspectives on this relationship, ultimately aiming to contribute to a more nuanced understanding of how economic policies can effectively promote a just and prosperous society.
