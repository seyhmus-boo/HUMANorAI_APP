This lecture explores the sociological perspective on mental health, moving beyond individualistic medical models to examine the social determinants and consequences of mental illness. We analyze how societal structures, including socioeconomic inequalities, cultural norms, and institutional practices, shape the prevalence, experience, and treatment of mental health conditions.  Key concepts such as the medicalization of deviance, stigma, and social support networks are critically examined.  The lecture demonstrates how social factors influence access to care, treatment outcomes, and the overall trajectory of individuals' mental health journeys.  Further, we discuss the social implications of widespread mental health challenges, considering their impact on productivity, economic burden, and social cohesion. The lecture concludes by emphasizing the crucial role of sociological insight in developing more effective and equitable mental health policies and interventions that address both individual needs and broader societal issues.
