Economic policies and social well-being are intricately linked, much like the engine and the body of a car.  Economic policies, representing the engine, determine the allocation of resources and opportunities within a society.  Expansionary fiscal policies, akin to accelerating the car, can stimulate economic growth, potentially leading to increased employment and higher incomes, thus enhancing social well-being. Conversely, contractionary policies, like applying the brakes, might curb inflation but could also lead to job losses and reduced social mobility, negatively impacting well-being.

However, the relationship isn't unidirectional.  Social factors, the car's chassis and its condition, influence the effectiveness of economic policies. High levels of inequality, for instance, can act as a faulty transmission, hindering the efficient distribution of economic gains, even with robust growth.  Similarly, a lack of access to education and healthcare (poor infrastructure) can limit an individual's capacity to benefit from economic opportunities, regardless of the engine's power.  Therefore, a holistic approach is necessary, considering both economic levers and social determinants, to ensure that economic growth translates into genuine improvements in social well-being for all members of society.
