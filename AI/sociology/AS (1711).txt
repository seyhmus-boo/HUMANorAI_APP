The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being remains a central theme in contemporary social science research.  While traditional economic models often prioritized GDP growth as the primary indicator of societal progress, a growing body of scholarship emphasizes the multidimensional nature of well-being, encompassing factors like health, education, environmental sustainability, and social inclusion.  Recent developments in this field highlight a shift away from purely utilitarian approaches, acknowledging the limitations of relying solely on aggregate economic indicators.  This paper examines the complex interplay between specific economic policies and their impact on various dimensions of social well-being.  We focus particularly on recent advancements in understanding the distributional effects of macroeconomic policies, including the implications of fiscal austerity measures and the role of social safety nets in mitigating inequality.  Furthermore, we analyze the burgeoning literature on the social costs of environmental degradation and the economic benefits of investing in human capital and social infrastructure. By integrating insights from economics, sociology, and political science, this research aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the causal pathways linking economic choices to societal outcomes and inform the development of more equitable and sustainable policies.
