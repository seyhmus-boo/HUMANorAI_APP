The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being remains a central theme in contemporary economics.  Recent developments highlight a growing shift away from purely GDP-focused metrics towards a more holistic assessment incorporating social indicators. While neoliberal policies emphasizing deregulation and austerity have been prevalent in recent decades, their social consequences, including increased inequality and diminished social mobility, are increasingly scrutinized.  This has led to renewed interest in policies promoting inclusive growth, such as investments in human capital (education and healthcare) and social safety nets.

Recent research emphasizes the crucial role of social determinants of health in impacting overall well-being.  This underscores the limitations of solely focusing on economic growth without considering its distributional effects.  Furthermore, the impact of automation and technological advancements on employment and income inequality necessitates policy interventions focusing on reskilling and social protection.  The COVID-19 pandemic has starkly revealed the vulnerability of populations lacking adequate social support, prompting discussions regarding the need for more robust social safety nets and universal basic services.  While the optimal balance between economic efficiency and social equity remains a subject of ongoing debate,  the trend suggests a greater acknowledgement of the inextricable link between sound economic policies and a thriving society.
