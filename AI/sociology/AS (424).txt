The intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a central theme in contemporary political economy.  While economic growth is often posited as a prerequisite for improved social well-being, the extent and distribution of benefits are contingent upon the specific policies implemented.  Neoliberal policies, emphasizing deregulation and market liberalization, while potentially stimulating growth, may exacerbate income inequality and social fragmentation if not accompanied by robust social safety nets.  Conversely, Keynesian approaches, prioritizing government intervention and social welfare programs, can mitigate economic shocks and enhance social equity, but may face criticisms regarding fiscal sustainability and potential inefficiencies.

Practical applications demonstrate this nuanced interplay.  Universal basic income (UBI) schemes, for example, aim to directly enhance well-being by providing a minimum income guarantee, impacting poverty reduction and social mobility.  However, their effectiveness depends on factors like funding mechanisms and potential disincentives to work.  Similarly, progressive taxation, aimed at redistributing wealth, can fund social programs improving healthcare and education, thus impacting health outcomes and human capital development.  However, high tax rates might negatively affect investment and economic growth. Ultimately, effective policies require a holistic approach, integrating economic growth strategies with targeted social interventions to ensure inclusive and sustainable improvements in social well-being.
