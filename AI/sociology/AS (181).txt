This paper investigates the complex and multifaceted relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  While economic growth is often presented as a primary indicator of societal progress, its correlation with social well-being remains contested.  This research explores this relationship, examining how specific macroeconomic policies – including fiscal policy, monetary policy, and trade liberalization – impact various dimensions of social well-being, such as health, education, inequality, and environmental sustainability. We move beyond a simple correlation analysis by considering mediating factors like income distribution, access to social safety nets, and the quality of governance. The study employs a comparative analysis across a diverse set of countries, utilizing both quantitative and qualitative methodologies.  Quantitative analysis involves econometric modeling to assess the impact of policy variables on well-being indicators.  Qualitative methods incorporate case studies to provide nuanced context and explore the mechanisms through which economic policies affect social outcomes. This research aims to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the interplay between economic policies and social well-being, ultimately informing the design of policies that promote inclusive and sustainable development.
