Social movements, defined as collective actions aimed at challenging existing power structures and instigating societal change, are complex phenomena demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding.  Sociology provides frameworks for analyzing mobilization, framing, and resource mobilization within these movements.  Political science contributes by examining the interaction between movements and the state, exploring strategies of influence and repression.  History illuminates the long-term trajectories of movements, revealing patterns of success and failure across diverse contexts.  Anthropology offers insights into the cultural meanings and symbols that shape movement identities and narratives.  Psychology contributes to understanding individual motivations, collective behavior, and the psychological impact of activism on both participants and opponents.  Finally, economics can analyze the distributional consequences of movements and their impact on resource allocation and power dynamics. By integrating these diverse perspectives, a richer, more nuanced understanding of social movements and their transformative potential in driving societal change emerges, moving beyond simplistic cause-and-effect models.
