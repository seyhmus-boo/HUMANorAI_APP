The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, posing significant challenges for empirical investigation. While ostensibly, pro-growth policies should enhance well-being through increased income and opportunities, the actual impact is mediated by numerous factors, making causal inference difficult.  Experimental approaches, while desirable for establishing causality, face inherent limitations.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard, are often impractical due to ethical and logistical constraints: large-scale policy interventions cannot be easily randomized across populations.  Furthermore, spillover effects and heterogeneous treatment effects complicate the analysis, challenging the external validity of localized RCTs.  Observational studies, though more feasible, are vulnerable to endogeneity bias â€“ the correlation between policies and outcomes may reflect unobserved confounding factors influencing both.  Moreover, measuring well-being itself presents difficulties, encompassing subjective dimensions like happiness and health, in addition to readily quantifiable metrics like income inequality.  The multidimensionality of well-being further complicates the evaluation of policy impacts, requiring sophisticated analytical frameworks to capture its nuances.  Therefore, disentangling the causal effects of economic policies on social well-being remains a significant methodological hurdle demanding innovative experimental and quasi-experimental designs.
