This paper explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, arguing that a unidirectional focus on economic growth is insufficient for achieving societal prosperity.  While robust economic growth can provide resources for social programs and reduce poverty, the distributional effects of such growth are crucial.  Policies prioritizing deregulation and austerity, while potentially stimulating GDP, may exacerbate inequality and erode social cohesion, negatively impacting well-being indicators like health, education, and social capital. Conversely, policies prioritizing social safety nets, equitable access to resources, and investment in human capital can demonstrably improve well-being, even if accompanied by slower GDP growth.  The paper contends that a holistic approach, integrating social metrics alongside traditional economic indicators, is essential for policy evaluation.  This necessitates a shift towards policy frameworks that explicitly address distributional outcomes and prioritize social justice, thereby promoting a more equitable and sustainable path towards improved social well-being.  Empirical evidence supporting this multi-dimensional approach is presented and discussed.
