Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies, exerts profound and multifaceted effects on social structures and individual well-being. While the descriptive and correlational evidence documenting its pervasive influence is extensive, establishing causal relationships and isolating specific mechanisms remains a significant challenge for social scientific research.  This paper explores the inherent difficulties in experimentally investigating the impact of class inequality, focusing on three key methodological obstacles. Firstly, the ethical considerations surrounding the manipulation of socioeconomic status present a formidable barrier, restricting researchers from directly assigning individuals to different class groups.  Secondly, the complex interplay of multiple interacting variables—including education, occupation, social networks, and geographical location—confounds efforts to isolate the independent effect of class inequality.  Thirdly, the long-term nature of its effects necessitates longitudinal studies, increasing costs and introducing attrition bias, thereby compromising the strength of inferences. Despite these difficulties, this paper argues that innovative experimental designs, such as natural experiments, field experiments with carefully constructed interventions, and advanced statistical techniques like propensity score matching, can contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the causal pathways linking class inequality to societal outcomes.  We will examine promising avenues for future research that strive to overcome these limitations.
