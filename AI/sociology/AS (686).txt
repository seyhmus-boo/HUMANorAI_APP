Good morning. Today's lecture examines the pivotal role of social movements in driving societal change.  Historically, movements have acted as crucial agents of transformation, challenging established power structures and advocating for alternative social orders.  Recent developments highlight a crucial shift towards digitally-mediated mobilization.  Platforms like Twitter and Facebook facilitate rapid information dissemination, bypassing traditional media gatekeepers and enabling the formation of transnational networks of activism.  We see this exemplified in movements like Black Lives Matter, whose global reach and impact were significantly amplified by online organization and viral campaigns.  However, this digital dependence also presents challenges.  The spread of misinformation and the potential for online surveillance necessitate critical analysis of the strategies and vulnerabilities inherent in digitally-driven movements.  Furthermore, the efficacy of online mobilization needs to be contextualized within broader socio-political landscapes, recognizing that digital activism often needs to be complemented by on-the-ground organizing to achieve sustainable societal change.  Finally, the intersectionality of contemporary movements, where various social justice concerns intertwine, presents both complexities and opportunities for collaborative action.
