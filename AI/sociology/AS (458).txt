While seemingly disparate, the impact of globalization on local cultures can be viewed through a quantum mechanical lens, focusing on the concepts of superposition and entanglement.  Prior to extensive globalization, cultural identities existed in a relatively localized, relatively pure state â€“ akin to a wave function collapsed into a single eigenstate. Globalization, however, introduces a superposition of cultural influences.  Local traditions are no longer isolated but exist in a probabilistic state, a complex superposition of their original form and external influences.  This superposition is not merely additive; the interaction between these influences generates entanglement.  Specific cultural practices become intertwined, exhibiting correlations that transcend geographical boundaries.  For example, traditional clothing styles might incorporate foreign materials or design elements, creating a new, hybridized expression.  This entanglement is not deterministic; the resultant cultural expression depends on the specific interactions and the strength of the "entanglement" between the local and global elements.  The degree of cultural change therefore reflects the strength of the globalizing "force," akin to a quantum measurement perturbing the wave function.  This entanglement can lead to both enrichment and homogenization, depending on the resilience and adaptability of the local culture in the face of globalizing pressures.  A strong local identity might resist complete collapse to a globalized state, maintaining a significant degree of its initial, pure state characteristics within the superposition.
