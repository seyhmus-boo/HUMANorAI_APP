Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, exerts profound and multifaceted effects across numerous domains, demanding an interdisciplinary approach for comprehensive understanding.  This abstract highlights the interconnectedness of economic stratification with social, political, and health outcomes.  Economically disadvantaged groups experience disproportionately higher rates of morbidity and mortality, linked to reduced access to quality healthcare and increased exposure to environmental hazards, a perspective drawing upon sociology, epidemiology, and environmental justice research.  Politically, class inequality manifests in unequal representation and diminished political efficacy, undermining democratic principles, as evidenced by political science literature on voter turnout and policy influence.  Sociological studies reveal the perpetuation of inequality through educational disparities, limited social mobility, and discriminatory practices, impacting social cohesion and fostering resentment.  Furthermore, psychological research illuminates the detrimental impacts of socioeconomic disadvantage on mental health and cognitive development.  Addressing class inequality requires integrated strategies encompassing economic redistribution, targeted social programs, and policy reforms that actively challenge systemic biases across multiple sectors.  Future research should prioritize longitudinal, multi-level studies to unravel the complex interplay of factors driving and sustaining this pervasive social issue.
