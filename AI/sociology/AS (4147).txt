This paper explores the role of education in shaping social norms through a novel quantum-mechanical framework.  We posit that societal norms, rather than being solely classical deterministic constructs, exhibit characteristics analogous to quantum superposition and entanglement.  Individual beliefs, represented as quantum states, exist in a superposition until measured through social interaction and reinforced by educational processes.  Education, acting as a selective measurement operator, collapses these superpositions, privileging certain norms through repeated exposure and reinforcement.  The curriculum, pedagogical methods, and social dynamics within the educational environment function as "Hamiltonians," shaping the evolution of these quantum states towards a socially preferred outcome.  Furthermore, interconnectedness of individuals, facilitated by educational exchange, induces entanglement, leading to correlated shifts in belief systems across the population. We propose a model based on density matrix formalism to quantify the degree of superposition and entanglement within a social system and demonstrate how educational interventions can modulate these parameters, resulting in predictable shifts in societal norms.  This approach offers a novel perspective on the complex interplay between education and social change, offering avenues for future research in the development of targeted educational strategies for societal betterment.
