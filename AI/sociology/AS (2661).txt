Social movements are pivotal agents of societal change, challenging existing power structures and norms to effect transformative shifts in social, political, and economic landscapes. This presentation explores the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal transformation, focusing on their strategies, mobilization tactics, and impact.  We analyze the interplay between movement framing, resource mobilization, and political opportunity structures in shaping movement success and longevity.  Drawing upon case studies encompassing diverse movements – from civil rights to environmental activism – we examine how different organizational structures, leadership styles, and levels of public support influence the capacity of movements to achieve their objectives.  The presentation further investigates the long-term consequences of successful and unsuccessful movements, exploring both intended and unintended outcomes, including institutional reforms, policy changes, and shifts in public consciousness.  Finally, we consider the evolving nature of social movements in the digital age, assessing the impact of new technologies and networked communication on movement mobilization, organization, and effectiveness in achieving social change.
