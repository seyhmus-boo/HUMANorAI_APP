This presentation examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change.  While acknowledging the diverse nature of social movements, from reformist to revolutionary, the analysis focuses on their efficacy in achieving substantive policy shifts and altering dominant societal norms.  We explore the key factors contributing to a movement's success, including the mobilization of resources (material and symbolic), the framing of grievances within a compelling narrative, and the strategic deployment of various tactics, encompassing both contentious and non-contentious actions.  The presentation will critically assess existing theoretical frameworks, such as resource mobilization theory and framing theory, examining their strengths and limitations in explaining the varied outcomes of social movements.  Case studies will be presented to illustrate diverse movement strategies and their impact on specific societal issues, highlighting the interplay between movement agency and structural constraints.  The ultimate goal is to contribute to a nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between social movements and societal transformation, acknowledging both their potential for significant progress and the inherent challenges they face.
