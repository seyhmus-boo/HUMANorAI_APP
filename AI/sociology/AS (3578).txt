This presentation examines the evolving role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on recent developments and complexities.  While traditional models emphasized large-scale mobilization and centralized organization, contemporary movements exhibit greater fluidity and decentralization, leveraging digital technologies for rapid communication and mobilization.  We will analyze how this shift impacts movement effectiveness, exploring the successes and limitations of networked activism in achieving policy changes and influencing public opinion.  Recent examples, including the #MeToo movement and Black Lives Matter, will be used to illustrate the interplay between online and offline activism, highlighting the crucial role of framing strategies in shaping public narratives and garnering support.  Furthermore, the presentation will address the challenges faced by contemporary movements, including the rise of counter-movements, the manipulation of information online, and the persistent inequalities that hinder equitable access to participation and influence.  Finally, we will discuss the implications of these developments for understanding the future of social movements and their capacity to effect transformative social change.
