Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, significantly impacts various social outcomes, yet rigorously establishing causal links through experimental research remains problematic.  This abstract highlights key methodological challenges in studying the effects of class inequality.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), while considered the gold standard, face inherent limitations in manipulating class structures at scale ethically and practically.  Quasi-experimental designs, leveraging naturally occurring variations in inequality, are often susceptible to confounding factors, making causal inference difficult.  Furthermore, the multidimensionality of class (economic, social, cultural capital) complicates isolating specific causal pathways. Measurement challenges also abound, with subjective assessments of class position introducing potential bias.  Existing studies frequently rely on correlational analyses, susceptible to ecological fallacy and reverse causality.  Addressing these limitations requires innovative methodologies, potentially including agent-based modelling, to simulate the complex interplay of factors contributing to both class stratification and its consequences.  Future research must focus on developing more robust methods to disentangle the complex web of causal relationships implicated in the pervasive effects of class inequality on individual and societal well-being.
