The literature extensively posits a strong correlation between education and the shaping of social norms, yet empirically demonstrating causality presents significant challenges.  While increased educational attainment is often associated with more progressive social attitudes and behaviors, establishing direct causation requires navigating complex confounding factors.  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs), the gold standard for causal inference, are difficult to implement on a large scale regarding societal norms due to ethical considerations and the long-term nature of such interventions.  Quasi-experimental designs, leveraging naturally occurring variations in educational access or quality, offer a viable alternative but are susceptible to selection bias.  Furthermore, the heterogeneity of educational experiences complicates analysis, as curriculum content and pedagogical approaches vary significantly, influencing their impact on norm internalization differently.  Measuring the impact itself is equally challenging, as social norms are often implicit and require sophisticated methodologies beyond simple surveys, necessitating longitudinal studies with diverse assessment tools.  Therefore, while the influence of education on social norms remains theoretically plausible, rigorous empirical evidence remains limited by methodological constraints and the inherent complexity of the phenomenon.
