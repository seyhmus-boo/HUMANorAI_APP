The relationship between economic policies and social well-being remains a central focus of economic and social research, with recent developments highlighting the limitations of solely GDP-focused approaches.  While traditional macroeconomic policies, such as monetary and fiscal interventions, continue to be influential, their impact on social well-being is increasingly scrutinized through a broader lens encompassing factors like income inequality, health outcomes, and environmental sustainability.  Recent research emphasizes the importance of considering distributional effects, demonstrating that even policies promoting aggregate economic growth can exacerbate existing inequalities, negatively impacting overall social well-being.  Furthermore,  growing attention is paid to the role of social safety nets, including universal basic income and robust social protection programs, in mitigating the negative impacts of economic shocks and promoting social cohesion.  Behavioral economics contributes by highlighting the importance of psychological factors and subjective well-being alongside objective indicators.  Future research should prioritize integrated models incorporating multi-dimensional measures of well-being, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between economic policies and their societal impact, moving beyond simplistic correlations towards a more causal understanding.
