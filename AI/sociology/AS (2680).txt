This presentation explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, emphasizing the crucial need for interdisciplinary approaches to fully understand and address this complex interplay.  While traditional economics focuses primarily on aggregate measures like GDP, a holistic understanding necessitates incorporating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science.  We argue that policies solely focused on economic growth, neglecting distributional effects and social determinants of health, may fail to enhance genuine well-being.  

Using a mixed-methods approach, incorporating quantitative analysis of economic indicators and qualitative data from sociological studies, we examine the impact of specific policy interventions – such as minimum wage legislation, social safety nets, and investment in education and healthcare – on various dimensions of social well-being, including mental health, social cohesion, and life satisfaction. The presentation highlights the limitations of relying solely on economic metrics and demonstrates how interdisciplinary collaboration can lead to the development of more effective and equitable policies that promote both economic prosperity and improved social well-being for all members of society.  Finally, we suggest avenues for future research to strengthen this crucial interdisciplinary field.
