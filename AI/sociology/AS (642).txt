This presentation examines the evolving role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing on recent developments and shifting dynamics.  While traditional models emphasized collective action and mobilization around shared grievances, contemporary movements demonstrate increased fluidity and complexity.  The rise of digital technologies has profoundly impacted mobilization strategies, facilitating rapid information dissemination, transnational networking, and the emergence of decentralized, leaderless movements.  We will explore the implications of this "networked activism" for movement efficacy, considering both its potential to overcome geographical limitations and its vulnerability to manipulation and fragmentation.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the intersection of social movements with broader political and economic contexts, highlighting the increasing influence of identity politics and the challenges posed by polarization and misinformation.  Finally, it will discuss the diverse outcomes of recent movements, ranging from legislative victories to the reinforcement of existing power structures, arguing for a nuanced understanding of movement success and its long-term impact on societal transformation.  The presentation will conclude by suggesting avenues for future research into the ever-evolving relationship between social movements and societal change.
