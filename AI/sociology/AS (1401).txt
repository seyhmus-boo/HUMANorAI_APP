Rapid urbanization presents a complex interplay of social and ecological changes impacting community life. Recent research emphasizes the multifaceted nature of this impact, moving beyond simplistic narratives of decline. While urbanization can lead to social fragmentation and weakened traditional social structures, particularly through increased anonymity and residential mobility,  new forms of community are concurrently emerging.  Digital technologies facilitate the formation of online communities, bridging geographical distances and fostering social interaction amongst diverse populations.  However, these digital communities often exhibit inequalities in access and participation, mirroring existing socio-economic disparities.  Studies investigating the built environment reveal a significant correlation between urban design features (e.g., green spaces, mixed-use development) and community cohesion.  Furthermore, research highlights the crucial role of community-based initiatives and participatory governance in mitigating the negative impacts of urbanization and fostering resilience. Future research should focus on integrating qualitative and quantitative methods to better understand the dynamic relationship between urbanization, social capital, and well-being,  and inform evidence-based urban planning strategies that promote inclusive and vibrant communities.
