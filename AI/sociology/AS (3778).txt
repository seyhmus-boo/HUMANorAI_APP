Good morning, everyone. Today's lecture explores the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being.  We can conceptualize this relationship as a two-sided coin. On one side, we have economic growth, often measured by GDP. This is like the engine of a car –  a powerful engine can propel the vehicle forward, generating wealth and opportunity. However, a powerful engine alone doesn’t guarantee a smooth and comfortable journey.  This is where the other side of the coin – social well-being – comes in.  Social well-being encompasses factors like health, education, and environmental sustainability.  Think of these as the car's suspension, tires, and safety features; crucial for a pleasant and safe ride.

Unfettered economic growth, without consideration for social well-being, is akin to driving recklessly at high speed; potentially leading to societal breakdowns like increased inequality, environmental damage, or public health crises. Conversely, neglecting economic growth in favour of excessive social welfare can be likened to having a beautifully appointed car that simply won't start.  Optimal social well-being, therefore, requires a balanced approach: a powerful, yet carefully managed engine, coupled with robust supporting systems that ensure a smooth, safe, and equitable journey for all.  Effective economic policy must consider both sides of this coin simultaneously.
