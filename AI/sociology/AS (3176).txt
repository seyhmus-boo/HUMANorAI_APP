This presentation examines the persistent and evolving nature of class inequality and its multifaceted effects on contemporary society.  Recent developments, particularly the exacerbation of inequality highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing cost-of-living crisis, demand renewed attention to this crucial social issue.  We will explore how these crises have disproportionately impacted vulnerable populations, widening existing disparities in health, education, and economic opportunity.  Furthermore, the presentation will analyze the implications of these trends for social cohesion and political stability, drawing on recent research highlighting the links between inequality and rising social unrest, political polarization, and declining trust in institutions.  We will discuss emerging scholarship challenging traditional understandings of class, incorporating intersectional analyses that consider the overlapping impacts of class with other social categories such as race, gender, and ethnicity. Finally, the presentation will briefly consider potential policy interventions aimed at mitigating class inequality and promoting a more equitable society, acknowledging the complex challenges and political hurdles involved.
