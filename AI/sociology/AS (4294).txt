Social movements, defined as collective actions aiming to effect societal change, play a crucial role in reshaping power structures and norms.  This lecture explores the multifaceted mechanisms through which movements achieve this impact.  Firstly, movements mobilize collective identity and resources, fostering a sense of shared grievance and purpose that facilitates sustained action. Secondly, they employ various tactics, ranging from peaceful protests and civil disobedience to more confrontational strategies, to challenge existing power dynamics and influence public opinion.  Thirdly, movement success is contingent upon framing â€“ the strategic presentation of grievances to resonate with broader societal values and gain wider support.  Ultimately, successful movements often lead to policy changes, legal reforms, and shifts in cultural norms, thereby demonstrating their significant contribution to long-term societal transformation. However, the lecture also acknowledges the limitations of movements, highlighting factors such as counter-movements, state repression, and internal fragmentation that can hinder their efficacy.  Further research is needed to understand the complex interplay of these factors and to refine models predicting movement success and impact.
