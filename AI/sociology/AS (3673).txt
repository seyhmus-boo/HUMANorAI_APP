The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is complex and multifaceted, demanding an interdisciplinary approach encompassing economics, sociology, political science, and public health.  While neoclassical economics often prioritizes GDP growth as a proxy for well-being, a broader perspective recognizes its limitations.  Social well-being encompasses diverse dimensions like health, education, social inclusion, and environmental sustainability, all significantly influenced by economic policy choices.

For instance, fiscal policies impacting income distribution – progressive taxation versus regressive consumption taxes – directly affect health outcomes via access to healthcare and nutritious food, as demonstrated by sociological research on health inequalities.  Similarly, investment in education, a key driver of human capital and social mobility, is a crucial component of social well-being, linked to economic growth through increased productivity (economic perspective) and reduced crime rates (criminological perspective).  Environmental policies, often framed within ecological economics, are essential for long-term societal well-being, mitigating climate change impacts that disproportionately affect vulnerable populations.

Therefore, evaluating economic policies solely on their impact on GDP is insufficient. A holistic assessment necessitates integrating insights from diverse disciplines to understand the complex interplay between economic growth, income distribution, social justice, and environmental sustainability, ultimately informing the design of policies that promote genuine social well-being.
