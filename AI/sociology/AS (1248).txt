Social integration, the process by which individuals become cohesive members of a larger society, is increasingly complex in the face of rising global migration and interconnectedness.  This paper examines the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, focusing on recent developments in the field.  While earlier research often framed diversity as a barrier to integration, highlighting potential for conflict and segregation, a burgeoning body of scholarship emphasizes the nuanced and often positive contributions of cultural heterogeneity.  Recent studies employing advanced statistical methods, such as multilevel modeling, have begun to disentangle the complex interplay between different dimensions of diversity (e.g., ethnic, religious, linguistic) and their differential impacts on social cohesion.  Furthermore,  research increasingly acknowledges the significance of contextual factors, including government policies promoting inclusion, the role of social institutions, and the mediating effects of individual-level factors like social capital and intergroup contact.  This paper will synthesize these recent advancements, critically evaluating the empirical evidence and exploring the implications for policy and practice aimed at fostering successful social integration in increasingly diverse societies.
