Class inequality, a persistent feature of human societies since the advent of stratified social structures, refers to the unequal distribution of resources, opportunities, and power amongst different social groups.  Historically, this has manifested in various forms, from ancient slave societies to feudal systems and modern capitalist economies. While the specific mechanisms vary, the underlying principle remains:  unequal access to capital, land, and education creates a hierarchy with profound societal effects.

High levels of class inequality are correlated with reduced social mobility, hindering individual advancement and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  This fosters social unrest and instability, as marginalized groups experience disenfranchisement and limited political influence. Moreover, inequality exacerbates health disparities, impacting life expectancy and overall well-being disproportionately across class lines.  Economically, it can lead to decreased aggregate demand and slower economic growth, as a large segment of the population lacks sufficient purchasing power. Ultimately, class inequality undermines social cohesion and compromises the equitable functioning of society.
