The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a complex and multifaceted issue demanding an interdisciplinary approach.  While traditional economics often focuses on aggregate indicators like GDP, a comprehensive understanding requires integrating insights from sociology, psychology, and political science.  Studies consistently demonstrate that purely growth-oriented policies, neglecting factors like income inequality and social safety nets, can hinder overall well-being.  Sociology illuminates the social stratification exacerbated by unequal access to resources and opportunities, highlighting the impact of economic policies on social cohesion and trust.  Psychology contributes by examining the effects of economic insecurity on mental health and subjective well-being, revealing the non-linear relationship between wealth and happiness.  Political science, meanwhile, analyzes the political processes shaping economic policy choices and their distributional consequences, considering factors such as lobbying and power dynamics.  Ultimately, effective policymaking demands a holistic framework acknowledging the interconnectedness of economic growth, social justice, and individual well-being, integrating diverse disciplinary perspectives to achieve more equitable and sustainable outcomes.  Further research should prioritize the development of multi-dimensional indicators that capture the multifaceted nature of social well-being, enabling more nuanced evaluations of economic policy efficacy.
