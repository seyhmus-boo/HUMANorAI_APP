Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, traditionally analyzed through sociological and economic lenses, offers a compelling avenue for exploration through the framework of quantum mechanics.  While seemingly disparate, this unconventional approach posits that societal structures, analogous to quantum systems, exhibit emergent properties arising from the interactions of individual "particles" – in this case, individuals within various socioeconomic strata. This paper argues that the concept of superposition, where individuals exist in multiple socioeconomic states simultaneously (e.g., potential for upward mobility juxtaposed with the reality of limited resources), plays a crucial role in shaping societal dynamics.  Furthermore, entanglement, mirroring the interconnectedness of individuals' fates within a class structure, influences the overall system’s stability and predictability.  We will explore how the inherent uncertainty principle, in its societal interpretation, underscores the unpredictable consequences of class-based policies and the limitations of deterministic social engineering. By applying a conceptual quantum framework to class inequality's multifaceted effects – including disparities in health, education, and political participation – we aim to illuminate previously underappreciated complexities and potential avenues for intervention based on the principles of quantum superposition, entanglement, and uncertainty.  This approach moves beyond traditional analyses, offering a fresh perspective on understanding and addressing this enduring societal problem.
