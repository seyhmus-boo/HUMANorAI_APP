Education plays a crucial role in shaping social norms, influencing individual attitudes and behaviors across diverse societal contexts. This paper explores the multifaceted interplay between education and norm formation, drawing upon insights from sociology, psychology, and anthropology.  We posit that education acts as a primary vehicle for transmitting and reinforcing both explicit and implicit societal norms through formal curricula, informal socialization within educational settings, and the development of critical thinking skills.  Sociological perspectives highlight the role of education in fostering social cohesion and promoting shared values, while psychological research underscores the impact of educational experiences on individual moral development and cognitive schemas related to social behavior.  Anthropological studies further illuminate the culturally-specific ways in which education shapes normative expectations and influences intergroup relations.  Analyzing the intersection of these disciplines reveals that while education can be a powerful tool for positive social change, propagating prosocial norms and combating harmful ones, it can also inadvertently perpetuate existing inequalities or inadvertently reinforce discriminatory norms.  Future research should focus on developing nuanced educational interventions that effectively promote positive norm change while addressing potential unintended consequences.
