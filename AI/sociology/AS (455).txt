Globalization, characterized by intensified interconnectedness and interdependence across national borders, has profoundly impacted local cultures worldwide. This research paper examines the multifaceted effects of this ongoing process, focusing on recent developments that complicate previously established understandings of cultural homogenization versus hybridization. While early globalization theories predicted a dominance of Western cultural forms leading to a homogenized global culture, recent empirical evidence suggests a more nuanced reality.  The rise of digital technologies and social media, for instance, has fostered both the dissemination of global cultural products and the revitalization of localized cultural expressions through online communities and platforms.  Furthermore, the increasing awareness of cultural appropriation and the growing movements advocating for cultural preservation highlight the agency of local communities in navigating global forces.  This study will investigate the complex interplay between these globalizing forces and local cultural resilience, analyzing specific case studies to illustrate the diverse impacts of globalization, ranging from cultural hybridity and adaptation to the erosion of traditional practices and the emergence of new forms of cultural resistance.  Ultimately, we aim to contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic relationship between globalization and local cultural identity in the 21st century.
