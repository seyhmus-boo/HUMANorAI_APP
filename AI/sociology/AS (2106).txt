This paper investigates the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a simplistic correlation to explore nuanced causal pathways.  We examine a broad range of economic policy instruments, including fiscal policies (taxation, spending), monetary policies (interest rates, inflation control), and labor market regulations, and their impact on key indicators of social well-being, such as health outcomes, educational attainment, income inequality, and subjective well-being measures.  Employing a comparative analysis across OECD nations over several decades, coupled with econometric modelling techniques, we identify varying degrees of effectiveness across different policy types and contexts.  Our findings suggest that while certain economic policies, particularly those focused on social safety nets and investments in human capital, demonstrably enhance social well-being, others, such as austerity measures or unchecked deregulation, may yield adverse consequences.  Crucially, the study highlights the importance of considering distributional effects, demonstrating that the overall macroeconomic performance alone is insufficient to capture the multifaceted nature of the relationship.  Further research is needed to explore the long-term impacts and potential unintended consequences of different policy combinations.
