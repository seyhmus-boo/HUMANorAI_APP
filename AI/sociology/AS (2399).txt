This presentation examines the pervasive influence of class inequality on societal well-being, focusing on its multifaceted consequences across various domains.  We argue that class inequality, beyond its economic dimensions, profoundly shapes social mobility, health outcomes, and political participation.  Drawing upon recent sociological and economic research, we explore the mechanisms through which socioeconomic disparities generate unequal access to resources, opportunities, and social networks. This includes analyzing the impact of unequal access to quality education, healthcare, and housing on intergenerational mobility and the perpetuation of disadvantage. Furthermore, the presentation will discuss the implications of class inequality for political polarization and democratic participation, highlighting the ways in which economic disparities can lead to unequal political influence and diminished civic engagement.  By analyzing existing data and theoretical frameworks, we aim to illuminate the complex interplay between class inequality and its detrimental effects on social cohesion, individual well-being, and the overall functioning of society, offering potential avenues for policy intervention to mitigate these disparities.
