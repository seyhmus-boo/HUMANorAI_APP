Education plays a pivotal role in shaping and reinforcing societal norms, acting as a powerful agent of both socialisation and change.  Traditionally, educational institutions transmitted established cultural values and beliefs, fostering conformity and perpetuating existing social hierarchies. However, recent developments indicate a more nuanced and complex relationship.  The rise of critical pedagogy and inclusive education approaches challenges the passive transmission of norms, instead promoting critical reflection on societal structures and power dynamics.  This involves actively engaging students in discussions about social justice, equity, and diversity, thereby fostering a more inclusive and equitable understanding of social norms.  Furthermore, advancements in technology and access to diverse information sources through the internet have broadened studentsâ€™ perspectives, exposing them to alternative viewpoints and challenging dominant narratives.  This increased exposure, while presenting opportunities for positive social change, also necessitates ongoing critical evaluation by educators to navigate the potential dissemination of misinformation and harmful ideologies.  Consequently, contemporary education increasingly grapples with balancing the transmission of foundational societal norms with the cultivation of critical thinking and social responsibility, acknowledging the inherent tension between stability and progress in shaping societal values.
