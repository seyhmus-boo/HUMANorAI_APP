This paper investigates the complex interplay between economic policies and social well-being, moving beyond a purely economic growth-centric perspective to encompass a broader range of social outcomes.  While conventional economic wisdom often prioritizes GDP growth as the primary indicator of societal progress, a growing body of literature emphasizes the need for a more nuanced understanding of how economic policies translate into tangible improvements in citizens' lives.  This study examines this crucial link, focusing on the differential impacts of various policy instruments across various dimensions of social well-being.  We analyze the relationship between fiscal policies (including taxation and social spending), monetary policies, and regulatory frameworks on key indicators such as health outcomes, educational attainment, income inequality, and social cohesion. Using a comparative analysis across different national contexts, this research explores the mediating role of institutional structures and social capital in shaping the effectiveness of economic policies in promoting social well-being.  Ultimately, this study aims to contribute to a more comprehensive theoretical framework that can inform the design and implementation of effective economic policies capable of fostering both economic prosperity and enhanced social well-being.
