Social movements, collective actions driven by shared grievances and aspirations, have profoundly shaped societies throughout history.  This paper examines the multifaceted role of social movements in driving societal change, focusing particularly on recent developments that challenge established theoretical frameworks.  While classic theories emphasized resource mobilization and political opportunity structures, contemporary movements exhibit increasing fluidity and reliance on digital technologies, blurring traditional boundaries between online and offline activism.  The rise of networked movements, facilitated by social media platforms, has demonstrably altered the dynamics of mobilization, communication, and the dissemination of information, creating both unprecedented opportunities and new challenges for collective action.  This study analyzes these shifts, exploring how the decentralized nature of digital activism impacts movement efficacy, longevity, and ultimate influence on policy and societal norms.  Furthermore, we consider the complexities of cross-national comparisons, recognizing the interplay of local contexts and global interconnectedness in shaping the trajectory and impact of contemporary social movements.  The paper ultimately aims to contribute to a nuanced understanding of how social movements, in their evolving forms, continue to be pivotal agents of societal transformation.
