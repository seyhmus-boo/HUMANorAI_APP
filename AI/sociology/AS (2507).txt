Class inequality, a persistent societal feature throughout history, arises from unequal distribution of resources and power, manifesting in disparities of wealth, income, status, and opportunity.  Historically, feudal systems exemplified stark class divisions, with hereditary nobility dominating serfs and peasants.  Industrialization exacerbated inequality, creating a burgeoning capitalist class alongside a large, impoverished working class.  While modern welfare states have mitigated some aspects, significant class disparities persist globally.

The effects of class inequality are multifaceted and profoundly detrimental to societal well-being.  Economic inequality correlates strongly with reduced social mobility, limiting individual potential and perpetuating cycles of poverty.  Furthermore, it fuels social unrest and political instability, as marginalized groups experience disenfranchisement and lack of access to essential services.  Health outcomes are also negatively impacted, with lower-class individuals facing higher rates of morbidity and mortality due to limited access to healthcare and increased stress from socioeconomic pressures.  Ultimately, high levels of class inequality undermine social cohesion and impede overall societal progress.
