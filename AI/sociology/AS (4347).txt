Class inequality, a persistent societal challenge, continues to exert profound and multifaceted effects on various aspects of human life.  Recent research underscores a widening gap between the wealthiest and poorest segments of society, driven by factors including technological advancements, globalization, and regressive tax policies.  This inequality manifests not only in disparities of income and wealth but also significantly impacts health outcomes, educational attainment, and social mobility. Studies employing longitudinal data increasingly demonstrate a strong correlation between socioeconomic status and life expectancy, with lower-class individuals experiencing higher rates of chronic diseases and premature mortality.  Educational disparities, exacerbated by unequal access to quality schooling and resources, perpetuate intergenerational inequality.  Furthermore, the concentration of wealth at the top limits social mobility, hindering opportunities for upward advancement and increasing social stratification.  Emerging research utilizes novel methodologies, such as network analysis and big data approaches, to better understand the complex interplay of factors contributing to and resulting from class inequality, offering valuable insights for the development of more effective policy interventions aimed at mitigating its detrimental societal consequences.  Future research should focus on evaluating the efficacy of targeted interventions and exploring the long-term societal implications of persistent inequality.
