Globalization's impact on local cultures is a complex interplay of homogenization and hybridization.  While increased cross-cultural interaction facilitated by globalization fosters the spread of dominant cultural forms – leading to concerns of cultural homogenization and the erosion of unique traditions – it simultaneously triggers processes of adaptation and innovation. Local cultures are not passive recipients; rather, they actively engage with global flows, selectively adopting, adapting, and reinterpreting elements to create hybrid cultural forms.  This process of glocalization demonstrates the resilience of local cultures, albeit in a transformed state.  The extent of homogenization versus hybridization varies significantly based on factors such as the pre-existing strength of local cultural institutions, the nature of global influence, and the agency of local actors in negotiating cultural exchange.  Future research should investigate the nuanced interplay between these factors to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of globalization’s enduring impact on cultural diversity.
