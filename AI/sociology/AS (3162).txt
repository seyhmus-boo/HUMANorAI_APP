This presentation examines the ongoing evolution of gender roles within contemporary societies, moving beyond simplistic binaries towards a nuanced understanding of their fluidity and complexity. We argue that while traditional gendered divisions of labor and social expectations persist, significant shifts are underway driven by factors including increased female education and workforce participation, changing family structures, and evolving social norms.  The presentation will analyze these shifts across various socio-cultural contexts, acknowledging the considerable heterogeneity in experiences and outcomes both within and between nations. We will discuss the impact of globalization, technological advancements, and legislative interventions on the renegotiation of gender roles, considering both progress and persistent inequalities.  Specific examples will be drawn from empirical research on work-life balance, caregiving responsibilities, political representation, and gender-based violence to illustrate the multifaceted nature of this ongoing transformation. The presentation concludes by highlighting future research directions needed to fully grasp the intricate dynamics of gender roles in an era of rapid social change and the implications for social justice and equity.
