Education's role in shaping social norms is akin to a gardener cultivating a garden.  Social norms, like plants, require nurturing and careful tending to flourish in desirable ways.  A laissez-faire approach, representing a lack of structured education, might yield a wild, unpredictable growth – a chaotic landscape of conflicting and potentially harmful norms. Conversely, intentional educational interventions act as selective breeding, cultivating beneficial norms while weeding out detrimental ones.  Just as a gardener uses specific tools (curricula, pedagogy), to achieve desired results (e.g., bountiful harvest), education employs various methodologies to foster desirable social behaviours. 

This presentation argues that education doesn’t merely reflect existing social norms; it actively shapes them.  Like a sculptor chiseling away at a block of marble to reveal a hidden form, education progressively refines societal expectations.  Through critical thinking skills, ethical frameworks, and exposure to diverse perspectives, education can cultivate empathy, tolerance, and a sense of shared responsibility – the "beautiful statue" of a more equitable and just society.  By understanding this dynamic interplay, we can leverage education's powerful capacity to cultivate positive social change, effectively "gardening" a more harmonious and flourishing future.
