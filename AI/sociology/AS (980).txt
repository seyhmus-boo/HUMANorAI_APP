This presentation explores the evolving sociological understanding of mental health and its profound social implications.  Historically, societal approaches to mental illness have oscillated between medicalization and social control, reflecting broader societal anxieties and power structures.  Early asylums, far from offering therapeutic care, often functioned as sites of social exclusion and stigmatization, reflecting a dominant paradigm that pathologized deviance.  The 20th century witnessed the rise of the biomedical model, emphasizing biological factors and pharmaceutical interventions, yet neglecting the significant social determinants of mental health.

This presentation argues that a solely biomedical approach is insufficient.  It will examine how social factors, including poverty, inequality, discrimination, and social support networks, significantly influence both the prevalence and experience of mental illness.  We will discuss the sociological concepts of labeling theory, medicalization, and the social construction of illness in understanding how societal perceptions shape individual experiences and access to care.  Finally, the presentation will address the ongoing societal challenges in destigmatizing mental illness, promoting social inclusion, and advocating for equitable access to effective mental healthcare, highlighting the crucial role of sociological insight in achieving these goals.
