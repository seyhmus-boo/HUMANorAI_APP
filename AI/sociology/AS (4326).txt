This paper investigates the multifaceted role of education in shaping social norms, moving beyond a simplistic transmission model to explore its complex and dynamic interactions with societal values.  While education is frequently posited as a vehicle for social progress and norm internalization, its influence is far from uniform. We argue that educational institutions act as both reflectors and shapers of prevailing norms, simultaneously reproducing existing power structures and providing avenues for challenging and transforming them. The research analyzes the mechanisms through which formal and informal aspects of education – curricula, pedagogy, social interactions within the educational environment – contribute to the acceptance, modification, or rejection of societal norms.  We consider the impact of different educational systems and levels, examining how factors such as socioeconomic background, cultural context, and institutional structures mediate the relationship between education and norm internalization.  Furthermore, the study explores the potential for education to facilitate the development of critical consciousness and promote the adoption of more equitable and inclusive norms.  The findings offer valuable insights into the crucial role of education in fostering social change and highlight the need for a nuanced understanding of its complex influence on the evolution of social norms.
