This presentation explores the multifaceted relationship between cultural diversity and social integration, focusing on recent developments in the field.  While increasing cultural diversity is often presented as a societal benefit, its impact on social cohesion remains a complex and contested issue.  Recent research highlights the crucial role of institutional frameworks in either facilitating or hindering integration processes.  We examine the effectiveness of policies promoting multiculturalism versus assimilation, analyzing empirical evidence on their respective outcomes concerning social capital, intergroup relations, and perceptions of belonging.  Furthermore, the presentation delves into the influence of digital spaces on cross-cultural communication and interaction, acknowledging both their potential to foster inclusivity and their susceptibility to the amplification of prejudice and misinformation.  Emerging trends in intergroup contact theory and the growing emphasis on intersectionality within diversity studies will also be considered.  Ultimately, the presentation argues for a nuanced understanding of the interplay between diversity and integration, advocating for policy interventions that acknowledge the complexities of social identity and promote equitable participation for all members of society.
