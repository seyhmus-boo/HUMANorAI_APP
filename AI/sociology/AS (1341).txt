The relationship between economic policies and social well-being is a complex and enduring subject of scholarly debate.  Historically, laissez-faire economics, dominant from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, prioritized economic growth with limited government intervention, often resulting in significant social inequality and periodic crises.  The Great Depression starkly revealed the societal costs of this approach, prompting the rise of Keynesian economics, which advocated for government intervention to manage aggregate demand and mitigate unemployment, thereby improving social well-being.

However, the post-war era also witnessed critiques of Keynesianism, particularly concerning inflation and unsustainable government debt.  Neoliberal policies, emphasizing deregulation, privatization, and free markets, gained prominence from the 1980s onward. While proponents argued these fostered economic growth, critics highlighted increased inequality and social instability as negative consequences.  

Contemporary scholarship emphasizes the multifaceted nature of this relationship.  While economic growth is generally correlated with improved social indicators like health and education, the distribution of that growth is crucial.  Policies focusing solely on GDP growth may neglect vital social determinants of well-being, such as access to healthcare, affordable housing, and environmental protection.  A nuanced approach, integrating social considerations into economic policymaking, is increasingly recognized as essential for achieving sustainable and equitable social well-being.
