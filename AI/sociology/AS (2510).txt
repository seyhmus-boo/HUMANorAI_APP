This paper examines the intricate relationship between economic policies and social well-being, drawing on insights from economics, sociology, and political science.  While traditional economic models often prioritize GDP growth as a proxy for well-being, this study argues for a more nuanced, multidimensional approach. We analyze how specific economic policies – including taxation, social welfare programs, and labor market regulations – differentially impact various social indicators, such as health outcomes, educational attainment, and social inequality.  Employing a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative analysis of macroeconomic data with qualitative insights from sociological case studies, we demonstrate that the impact of economic policies is contingent upon social context and institutional arrangements.  Findings reveal a complex interplay between economic growth and social equity, suggesting that policies solely focused on maximizing GDP can exacerbate social disparities, potentially undermining long-term well-being. Conversely, policies prioritizing social justice and inclusive growth can generate positive feedback loops, improving both economic productivity and societal well-being.  Further interdisciplinary research is necessary to refine policy recommendations that effectively promote sustainable and equitable economic development.
