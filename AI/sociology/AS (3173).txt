Good morning. Today's lecture examines social movements through a somewhat unconventional lens: quantum mechanics. While seemingly disparate,  parallels exist.  Consider the wave-particle duality.  A social movement, initially a nascent idea (particle), propagates as a wave of collective action, its momentum influenced by various societal "potentials" â€“ existing power structures, cultural norms, and media representation.  The movement's "state" is not fixed; it's a superposition of multiple possibilities, oscillating between periods of high and low energy (mobilization and dormancy).  

Critical mass, analogous to a quantum threshold, must be reached for observable societal change.  This requires a sufficient number of "participants" coherently acting, minimizing "decoherence" from internal dissent or external suppression.  Successful movements achieve a "measurement," resulting in a collapse of the superposition into a new societal "ground state," characterized by altered laws, policies, or social norms.  However, even after this "measurement," the system remains dynamic, susceptible to further perturbations and potential future movements, highlighting the inherently probabilistic nature of societal evolution.
