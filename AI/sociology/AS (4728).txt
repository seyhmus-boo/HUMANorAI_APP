Globalization, characterized by intensified cross-border interactions and interconnectedness, has profoundly impacted local cultures worldwide.  While its proponents emphasize economic growth and cultural exchange, critics highlight the homogenizing effects on diverse traditions and practices. This research paper examines the multifaceted impact of globalization on local cultures, focusing on recent developments within the 21st century.  Specifically, it analyzes the interplay between global forces – such as the rapid expansion of digital technologies and the proliferation of transnational corporations – and the resilience, adaptation, and transformation of local cultural expressions.  Recent studies have emphasized the nuanced nature of this relationship, moving beyond simple narratives of cultural imperialism or complete assimilation.  We consider the emergence of hybrid cultures, the strategic use of cultural resources for economic gain (cultural commodification), and the rise of glocalization – the adaptation of global trends to local contexts.  Further, this paper explores the role of social media in both homogenizing and diversifying cultural landscapes, as well as the strategies employed by local communities to preserve their unique identities in the face of globalization's pressures.  The analysis will ultimately contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex and dynamic relationship between global forces and local cultural realities.
