Good morning. Today's lecture addresses the pervasive issue of class inequality and its societal ramifications.  Imagine a marathon where some runners begin at the starting line with advanced training, top-of-the-line equipment, and even a personal support team, while others start miles behind, lacking proper footwear and nutrition. This disparity mirrors class inequality: unequal access to resources from birth profoundly impacts life chances.

The consequences are multifaceted.  Consider the societal body:  a severely malnourished limb (the impoverished underclass) weakens the entire organism, leading to reduced overall health and productivity.  Increased crime rates, fuelled by desperation and lack of opportunity, represent a systemic infection threatening societal stability.  Conversely, excessive concentration of resources in the "well-equipped" runners (the elite) can lead to societal stagnation â€“ a lack of innovation and progress driven by a lack of diverse perspectives and competitive pressure.  Ultimately, persistent class inequality undermines social cohesion, fostering resentment and hindering the attainment of a truly equitable and flourishing society.  We must therefore strive for a more level playing field, ensuring that every individual has the opportunity to reach their full potential.
