This presentation examines the complex and often under-researched role of education in shaping social norms, focusing specifically on the methodological challenges inherent in experimental investigation. While intuitively, education is expected to influence normative behaviour, establishing a causal link experimentally presents significant difficulties.  We discuss three key challenges: (1)  the difficulty in isolating the effect of education from other confounding variables such as socioeconomic status and pre-existing attitudes; (2) the long-term nature of norm internalization, requiring longitudinal studies with substantial attrition rates and potential cohort effects; and (3) the ethical considerations surrounding experimental manipulation of educational content related to sensitive social norms, particularly those involving potentially harmful behaviours. We will present examples from existing literature highlighting these challenges, and propose potential solutions, including the use of quasi-experimental designs, sophisticated statistical modelling to account for confounders, and the ethical implementation of interventions focusing on specific, measurable behavioural outcomes rather than broad societal norms.  Ultimately, we argue that addressing these methodological hurdles is crucial for advancing our understanding of education's powerful, yet nuanced, influence on social behaviour.
